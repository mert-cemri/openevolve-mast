The task is to create a CLI utility, which is a command-line interface tool. This type of tool is typically implemented as a script or application that runs in a terminal or command prompt. Given the options provided, the most suitable modality for this task would be an "Application" since it involves creating a tool that can be executed via a command line.

However, let's consider if there are any other modalities that might fit. The task does not involve creating visual content, presenting information in a document format, or building a website or dashboard. Therefore, the other options like Image, Document, PowerPoint, Excel, PDF, Website, Dashboard, and Mind Map do not seem to be appropriate for this specific task.

Given this analysis, I believe the most suitable product modality for this task is "Application".

The task is to create a CLI utility, which is a command-line interface tool. This tool will be executed via a terminal or command prompt, and it will process a text file to add line numbers to its content. The output can either be written to a new file or printed to the standard output.

Given the options provided, the most suitable modality for this task is indeed "Application" since it involves creating a tool that can be executed via a command line. The other options like Image, Document, PowerPoint, Excel, PDF, Website, Dashboard, and Mind Map do not seem to be appropriate for this specific task.

Here is a conversation between two roles: Chief Executive Officer: ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.

To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.

Chief Executive Officer: ChatDev has made products in the following form before:
Image: can present information in line chart, bar chart, flow chart, cloud chart, Gantt chart, etc.
Document: can present information via .docx files.
PowerPoint: can present information via .pptx files.
Excel: can present information via .xlsx files.
PDF: can present information via .pdf files.
Website: can present personal resume, tutorial, products, or ideas, via .html files.
Application: can implement visualized game, software, tool, etc, via python.
Dashboard: can display a panel visualizing real-time information.
Mind Map: can represent ideas, with related concepts arranged around a core concept.
As the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?
Note that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> PowerPoint".

Chief Product Officer: The task is to create a CLI utility, which is a command-line interface tool. This type of tool is typically implemented as a script or application that runs in a terminal or command prompt. Given the options provided, the most suitable modality for this task would be an "Application" since it involves creating a tool that can be executed via a command line.
However, let's consider if there are any other modalities that might fit. The task does not involve creating visual content, presenting information in a document format, or building a website or dashboard. Therefore, the other options like Image, Document, PowerPoint, Excel, PDF, Website, Dashboard, and Mind Map do not seem to be appropriate for this specific task.
Given this analysis, I believe the most suitable product modality for this task is "Application".

The task is clearly to create a CLI utility, which is a command-line interface tool. This tool will be executed via a terminal or command prompt, and it will process a text file to add line numbers to its content. The output can either be written to a new file or printed to the standard output.

Given the options provided, the most suitable modality for this task is indeed "Application" since it involves creating a tool that can be executed via a command line. The other options like Image, Document, PowerPoint, Excel, PDF, Website, Dashboard, and Mind Map do not seem to be appropriate for this specific task.

Therefore, I agree with the analysis and conclusion.

The task is straightforward and involves reading a text file, adding line numbers, and outputting the result either to a new file or standard output. Python is a great choice for this task due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive standard library, which includes modules for file handling and string manipulation.

Given these considerations, I propose Python as the programming language for this task.

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The task involves reading a text file, adding line numbers to each line, and then outputting the result either to a new file or standard output. Given the simplicity of the task, we need a language that is easy to use and has strong support for file handling and command-line interface (CLI) development.

Python is a strong candidate due to its simplicity and powerful standard library, which includes modules like `argparse` for CLI argument parsing and built-in file handling capabilities. This makes it easy to implement the required functionality with minimal code.

Java and C++ are also capable of handling this task, but they generally require more boilerplate code and are more complex for such a simple utility. Java, for example, would require setting up a project structure, handling exceptions more explicitly, and using libraries like `Scanner` for file reading and `PrintWriter` for file writing. C++ would require similar setup and more complex syntax for file operations.

Given these considerations, Python remains the best choice for this task due to its simplicity and ease of use.

Chief Executive Officer: According to the new user's task and some creative brainstorm ideas listed below: 
Task: "Write a CLI utility to add line numbers to a text file. The output can be to a new file or standard output.".
Modality: "application".
Ideas: "".
We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 
As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).
Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

Chief Technology Officer: The task is straightforward and involves reading a text file, adding line numbers, and outputting the result either to a new file or standard output. Python is a great choice for this task due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive standard library, which includes modules for file handling and string manipulation.
Given these considerations, I propose Python as the programming language for this task.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Write a CLI utility to add line numbers to a text file. The output can be to a new file or standard output..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Write a CLI utility to add line numbers to a text file. The output can be to a new file or standard output.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: "  Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via   Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

### Step 1: Planning the Architecture

The task is to create a CLI utility with a GUI that adds line numbers to a text file. The utility should be able to output the result to either a new file or standard output.

#### Core Classes and Functions

1. **Main Application Class (`App`)**: This class will handle the GUI and user interactions.
2. **CLI Utility Class (`LineNumberUtility`)**: This class will handle the core functionality of adding line numbers to a text file.
3. **Utility Functions**:
   - `add_line_numbers`: This function will read a file, add line numbers, and return the modified content.
   - `write_to_file`: This function will write the modified content to a new file.
   - `print_to_stdout`: This function will print the modified content to standard output.

### Step 2: Implementation

#### File Structure

1. `main.py`: The entry point of the application.
2. `line_number_utility.py`: Contains the core functionality.
3. `gui.py`: Contains the GUI implementation.

### Step 3: Code Implementation

#### main.py

```python
'''
Main entry point for the Line Number Utility application.

    parser.add_argument('-o', '--output_file', help='Output text file (optional)')
    parser.add_argument('-g', '--gui', action='store_true', help='Run with GUI')
    args = parser.parse_args()

    if args.gui:
        app = App()
        app.run()
    else:
        utility = LineNumberUtility(args.input_file, args.output_file)
        utility.process_file()

if __name__ == '__main__':

Here is a new customer's task: Write a CLI utility to add line numbers to a text file. The output can be to a new file or standard output..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

### Review of the Code

1. **All referenced classes should be imported:**
   - `main.py` imports `argparse`, `LineNumberUtility`, and `App` which are all necessary.
   - `line_number_utility.py` imports nothing, but it doesn't need to import anything as it only uses built-in functions.
   - `gui.py` imports `tkinter` and `filedialog`, `messagebox`, and `LineNumberUtility` which are all necessary.

2. **All methods should be implemented:**
   - All methods in `main.py`, `line_number_utility.py`, and `gui.py` are implemented.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments:**
   - The code has docstrings for the classes and methods, which is good. However, some methods could benefit from additional comments explaining their purpose or steps within the method.

4. **No potential bugs:**
   - The code looks robust, but there are a few potential issues:
     - In `gui.py`, the `process_file` method does not handle exceptions that might occur during file operations.
     - In `line_number_utility.py`, the `add_line_numbers` method does not handle exceptions that might occur during file reading.
     - In `line_number_utility.py`, the `write_to_file` method does not handle exceptions that might occur during file writing.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user:**
   - The project meets the requirement of adding line numbers to a text file and supports both CLI and GUI modes.

6. **Most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement:**
   - The logic seems correct, but the lack of exception handling could lead to crashes if something goes wrong during file operations.

### Highest Priority Comment and Suggestion

**Comment with the highest priority:**
The code lacks exception handling for file operations, which can lead to crashes if something goes wrong during reading or writing files.

**Suggestion on revision:**
Add try-except blocks around file operations in `line_number_utility.py` and `gui.py` to handle potential exceptions gracefully.

Here is how you can revise the `line_number_utility.py` file to include exception handling:

```python
'''
Utility class to add line numbers to a text file.
Handles reading, processing, and writing the file.
'''
class LineNumberUtility:
    def __init__(self, input_file, output_file=None):
        self.input_file = input_file
        self.output_file = output_file

    def add_line_numbers(self):
        try:
            with open(self.input_file, 'r') as file:
                lines = file.readlines()
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"Error: The file {self.input_file} does not exist.")
            return None
        except IOError:
            print(f"Error: An error occurred while reading the file {self.input_file}.")
            return None
        numbered_lines = [f"{i+1}: {line}" for i, line in enumerate(lines)]
        return ''.join(numbered_lines)

    def write_to_file(self, content):
        try:
            with open(self.output_file, 'w') as file:
                file.write(content)
        except IOError:
            print(f"Error: An error occurred while writing to the file {self.output_file}.")

    def print_to_stdout(self, content):
        print(content)

    def process_file(self):
        content = self.add_line_numbers()
        if content is None:
            return
        if self.output_file:
            self.write_to_file(content)
        else:
            self.print_to_stdout(content)
```

And here is how you can revise the `gui.py` file to include exception handling:

```python
'''
GUI implementation for the Line Number Utility application.
Uses tkinter for the graphical user interface.
'''
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog, messagebox
from line_number_utility import LineNumberUtility

class App:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = tk.Tk()
        self.root.title("Line Number Utility")
        self.root.geometry("400x200")
        self.input_file = None
        self.output_file = None
        self.create_widgets()

    def create_widgets(self):
        self.input_label = tk.Label(self.root, text="Input File:")
        self.input_label.pack()
        self.input_entry = tk.Entry(self.root, width=50)
        self.input_entry.pack()
        self.input_button = tk.Button(self.root, text="Browse", command=self.browse_input)
        self.input_button.pack()
        self.output_label = tk.Label(self.root, text="Output File (optional):")
        self.output_label.pack()
        self.output_entry = tk.Entry(self.root, width=50)
        self.output_entry.pack()
        self.output_button = tk.Button(self.root, text="Browse", command=self.browse_output)
        self.output_button.pack()
        self.process_button = tk.Button(self.root, text="Process", command=self.process_file)
        self.process_button.pack()

    def browse_input(self):
        self.input_file = filedialog.askopenfilename(filetypes=[("Text files", "*.txt")])
        self.input_entry.delete(0, tk.END)
        self.input_entry.insert(0, self.input_file)

    def browse_output(self):
        self.output_file = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".txt", filetypes=[("Text files", "*.txt")])
        self.output_entry.delete(0, tk.END)
        self.output_entry.insert(0, self.output_file)

    def process_file(self):
        if not self.input_file:
            messagebox.showerror("Error", "Please select an input file.")
            return
        try:
            utility = LineNumberUtility(self.input_file, self.output_file)
            utility.process_file()
            messagebox.showinfo("Success", "File processed successfully.")
        except Exception as e:
            messagebox.showerror("Error", f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")

    def run(self):
        self.root.mainloop()

 ### Review of the Code

1. **All referenced classes should be imported:**
   - `main.py` imports `argparse`, `LineNumberUtility`, and `App` which are all necessary.
   - `line_number_utility.py` imports nothing, but it doesn't need to import anything as it only uses built-in functions.
   - `gui.py` imports `tkinter` and `filedialog`, `messagebox`, and `LineNumberUtility` which are all necessary.

2. **All methods should be implemented:**
   - All methods in `main.py`, `line_number_utility.py`, and `gui.py` are implemented.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments:**
   - The code has docstrings for the classes and methods, which is good. However, some methods could benefit from additional comments explaining their purpose or steps within the method.

4. **No potential bugs:**
   - The code looks robust, but there are a few potential issues:
     - In `gui.py`, the `process_file` method does not handle exceptions that might occur during file operations.
     - In `line_number_utility.py`, the `add_line_numbers` method does not handle exceptions that might occur during file reading.
     - In `line_number_utility.py`, the `write_to_file` method does not handle exceptions that might occur during file writing.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user:**
   - The project meets the requirement of adding line numbers to a text file and supports both CLI and GUI modes.

6. **Most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement:**
   - The logic seems correct, but the lack of exception handling could lead to crashes if something goes wrong during file operations.

### Highest Priority Comment and Suggestion

**Comment with the highest priority:**
The code lacks exception handling for file operations, which can lead to crashes if something goes wrong during reading or writing files.

**Suggestion on revision:**
Add try-except blocks around file operations in `line_number_utility.py` and `gui.py` to handle potential exceptions gracefully.

Here is how you can revise the `line_number_utility.py` file to include exception handling:

```python
'''
Utility class to add line numbers to a text file.
Handles reading, processing, and writing the file.
'''
class LineNumberUtility:
    def __init__(self, input_file, output_file=None):
        self.input_file = input_file
        self.output_file = output_file

    def add_line_numbers(self):
        try:
            with open(self.input_file, 'r') as file:
                lines = file.readlines()
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"Error: The file {self.input_file} does not exist.")
            return None
        except IOError:
            print(f"Error: An error occurred while reading the file {self.input_file}.")
            return None
        numbered_lines = [f"{i+1}: {line}" for i, line in enumerate(lines)]
        return ''.join(numbered_lines)

    def write_to_file(self, content):
        try:
            with open(self.output_file, 'w') as file:
                file.write(content)
        except IOError:
            print(f"Error: An error occurred while writing to the file {self.output_file}.")

    def print_to_stdout(self, content):
        print(content)

    def process_file(self):
        content = self.add_line_numbers()
        if content is None:
            return
        if self.output_file:
            self.write_to_file(content)
        else:
            self.print_to_stdout(content)
```

And here is how you can revise the `gui.py` file to include exception handling:

```python
'''
GUI implementation for the Line Number Utility application.
Uses tkinter for the graphical user interface.
'''
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog, messagebox
from line_number_utility import LineNumberUtility

class App:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = tk.Tk()
        self.root.title("Line Number Utility")
        self.root.geometry("400x200")
        self.input_file = None
        self.output_file = None
        self.create_widgets()

    def create_widgets(self):
        self.input_label = tk.Label(self.root, text="Input File:")
        self.input_label.pack()
        self.input_entry = tk.Entry(self.root, width=50)
        self.input_entry.pack()
        self.input_button = tk.Button(self.root, text="Browse", command=self.browse_input)
        self.input_button.pack()
        self.output_label = tk.Label(self.root, text="Output File (optional):")
        self.output_label.pack()
        self.output_entry = tk.Entry(self.root, width=50)
        self.output_entry.pack()
        self.output_button = tk.Button(self.root, text="Browse", command=self.browse_output)
        self.output_button.pack()
        self.process_button = tk.Button(self.root, text="Process", command=self.process_file)
        self.process_button.pack()

    def browse_input(self):
        self.input_file = filedialog.askopenfilename(filetypes=[("Text files", "*.txt")])
        self.input_entry.delete(0, tk.END)
        self.input_entry.insert(0, self.input_file)

    def browse_output(self):
        self.output_file = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".txt", filetypes=[("Text files", "*.txt")])
        self.output_entry.delete(0, tk.END)
        self.output_entry.insert(0, self.output_file)

    def process_file(self):
        if not self.input_file:
            messagebox.showerror("Error", "Please select an input file.")
            return
        try:
            utility = LineNumberUtility(self.input_file, self.output_file)
            utility.process_file()
            messagebox.showinfo("Success", "File processed successfully.")
        except Exception as e:
            messagebox.showerror("Error", f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")

    def run(self):
        self.root.mainloop()
```

By adding these exception handling blocks, you ensure that the application can gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful feedback to the user.

Comments on Codes:
"### Review of the Code

1. **All referenced classes should be imported:**
   - `main.py` imports `argparse`, `LineNumberUtility`, and `App` which are all necessary.
   - `line_number_utility.py` imports nothing, but it doesn't need to import anything as it only uses built-in functions.
   - `gui.py` imports `tkinter` and `filedialog`, `messagebox`, and `LineNumberUtility` which are all necessary.

2. **All methods should be implemented:**
   - All methods in `main.py`, `line_number_utility.py`, and `gui.py` are implemented.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments:**
   - The code has docstrings for the classes and methods, which is good. However, some methods could benefit from additional comments explaining their purpose or steps within the method.

4. **No potential bugs:**
   - The code looks robust, but there are a few potential issues:
     - In `gui.py`, the `process_file` method does not handle exceptions that might occur during file operations.
     - In `line_number_utility.py`, the `add_line_numbers` method does not handle exceptions that might occur during file reading.
     - In `line_number_utility.py`, the `write_to_file` method does not handle exceptions that might occur during file writing.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user:**
   - The project meets the requirement of adding line numbers to a text file and supports both CLI and GUI modes.

6. **Most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement:**
   - The logic seems correct, but the lack of exception handling could lead to crashes if something goes wrong during file operations.

### Highest Priority Comment and Suggestion

**Comment with the highest priority:**
The code lacks exception handling for file operations, which can lead to crashes if something goes wrong during reading or writing files.

**Suggestion on revision:**
Add try-except blocks around file operations in `line_number_utility.py` and `gui.py` to handle potential exceptions gracefully.

Here is how you can revise the `line_number_utility.py` file to include exception handling:

```python
'''
Utility class to add line numbers to a text file.
Handles reading, processing, and writing the file.
'''
class LineNumberUtility:
    def __init__(self, input_file, output_file=None):
        self.input_file = input_file
        self.output_file = output_file

    def add_line_numbers(self):
        try:
            with open(self.input_file, 'r') as file:
                lines = file.readlines()
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"Error: The file {self.input_file} does not exist.")
            return None
        except IOError:
            print(f"Error: An error occurred while reading the file {self.input_file}.")
            return None
        numbered_lines = [f"{i+1}: {line}" for i, line in enumerate(lines)]
        return ''.join(numbered_lines)

    def write_to_file(self, content):
        try:
            with open(self.output_file, 'w') as file:
                file.write(content)
        except IOError:
            print(f"Error: An error occurred while writing to the file {self.output_file}.")

    def print_to_stdout(self, content):
        print(content)

    def process_file(self):
        content = self.add_line_numbers()
        if content is None:
            return
        if self.output_file:
            self.write_to_file(content)
        else:
            self.print_to_stdout(content)
```

And here is how you can revise the `gui.py` file to include exception handling:

```python

By adding these exception handling blocks, you ensure that the application can gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful feedback to the user."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

All referenced classes should be imported:\n   - main.py imports argparse, LineNumberUtility, and App which are all necessary.\n   - line_number_utility.py imports nothing, but it doesn\'t need to import anything as it only uses built-in functions.\n   - gui.py imports tkinter and filedialog, messagebox, and LineNumberUtility which are all necessary.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented:\n   - All methods in main.py, line_number_utility.py, and gui.py are implemented.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments:\n   - The code has docstrings for the classes and methods, which is good. However, some methods could benefit from additional comments explaining their purpose or steps within the method.\n\n4. No potential bugs:\n   - The code looks robust, but there are a few potential issues:\n     - In gui.py, the process_file method does not handle exceptions that might occur during file operations.\n     - In line_number_utility.py, the add_line_numbers method does not handle exceptions that might occur during file reading.\n     - In line_number_utility.py, the write_to_file method does not handle exceptions that might occur during file writing.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user:\n   - The project meets the requirement of adding line numbers to a text file and supports both CLI and GUI modes.\n\n6. Most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement:\n   - The logic seems correct, but the lack of exception handling could lead to crashes if something goes wrong during file operations.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment and Suggestion\n\nComment with the highest priority:\nThe code lacks exception handling for file operations, which can lead to crashes if something goes wrong during reading or writing files.\n\nSuggestion on revision:\nAdd try-except blocks around file operations in line_number_utility.py and gui.py to handle potential exceptions gracefully.\n\nHere is how you can revise the line_number_utility.py file to include exception handling:\n\npython\n\'\'\'\nUtility class to add line numbers to a text file.\nHandles reading, processing, and writing the file.\n\'\'\'\nclass LineNumberUtility:\n    def __init__(self, input_file, output_file=None):\n        self.input_file = input_file\n        self.output_file = output_file\n\n    def add_line_numbers(self):\n        try:\n            with open(self.input_file, \'r\') as file:\n                lines = file.readlines()\n        except FileNotFoundError:\n            print(f"Error: The file {self.input_file} does not exist.")\n            return None\n        except IOError:\n            print(f"Error: An error occurred while reading the file {self.input_file}.")\n            return None\n        numbered_lines = [f"{i+1}: {line}" for i, line in enumerate(lines)]\n        return \'\'.join(numbered_lines)\n\n    def write_to_file(self, content):\n        try:\n            with open(self.output_file, \'w\') as file:\n                file.write(content)\n        except IOError:\n            print(f"Error: An error occurred while writing to the file {self.output_file}.")\n\n    def print_to_stdout(self, content):\n        print(content)\n\n    def process_file(self):\n        content = self.add_line_numbers()\n        if content is None:\n            return\n        if self.output_file:\n            self.write_to_file(content)\n        else:\n            self.print_to_stdout(content)\n\n\nAnd here is how you can revise the gui.py file to include exception handling:\n\npython\n\'\'\'\nGUI implementation for the Line Number Utility application.\nUses tkinter for the graphical user interface.\n\'\'\'\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom tkinter import filedialog, messagebox\nfrom line_number_utility import LineNumberUtility\n\nclass App:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.root = tk.Tk()\n        self.root.title("Line Number Utility")\n        self.root.geometry("400x200")\n        self.input_file = None\n        self.output_file = None\n        self.create_widgets()\n\n    def create_widgets(self):\n        self.input_label = tk.Label(self.root, text="Input File:")\n        self.input_label.pack()\n        self.input_entry = tk.Entry(self.root, width=50)\n        self.input_entry.pack()\n        self.input_button = tk.Button(self.root, text="Browse", command=self.browse_input)\n        self.input_button.pack()\n        self.output_label = tk.Label(self.root, text="Output File (optional):")\n        self.output_label.pack()\n        self.output_entry = tk.Entry(self.root, width=50)\n        self.output_entry.pack()\n        self.output_button = tk.Button(self.root, text="Browse", command=self.browse_output)\n        self.output_button.pack()\n        self.process_button = tk.Button(self.root, text="Process", command=self.process_file)\n        self.process_button.pack()\n\n    def browse_input(self):\n        self.input_file = filedialog.askopenfilename(filetypes=[("Text files", "*.txt")])\n        self.input_entry.delete(0, tk.END)\n        self.input_entry.insert(0, self.input_file)\n\n    def browse_output(self):\n        self.output_file = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".txt", filetypes=[("Text files", "*.txt")])\n        self.output_entry.delete(0, tk.END)\n        self.output_entry.insert(0, self.output_file)\n\n    def process_file(self):\n        if not self.input_file:\n            messagebox.showerror("Error", "Please select an input file.")\n            return\n        try:\n            utility = LineNumberUtility(self.input_file, self.output_file)\n            utility.process_file()\n            messagebox.showinfo("Success", "File processed successfully.")\n        except Exception as e:\n            messagebox.showerror("Error", f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")\n\n    def run(self):\n        self.root.mainloop()\n\n\nBy adding these exception handling blocks, you ensure that the application can gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful feedback to the user.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

### Review of the Code

1. **All referenced classes should be imported:**
   - All classes are imported correctly in `main.py`.

2. **All methods should be implemented:**
   - All methods are implemented, but there is a potential issue with the GUI part. The `process_file` method in `App` class does not handle the case where the user does not provide an output file, which is optional.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments:**
   - The methods have comments, but they could be more detailed. For example, the `process_file` method in `LineNumberUtility` could explain what it does step by step.

4. **No potential bugs:**
   - There are a few potential issues:
     - The `process_file` method in `App` class does not handle the case where the user does not provide an output file.
     - The `add_line_numbers` method in `LineNumberUtility` class should handle the case where the file is empty.
     - The `write_to_file` method in `LineNumberUtility` class should handle the case where the output file is not provided.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user:**
   - The project mostly conforms to the task, but the GUI part needs to be improved to handle optional output files.

6. **Most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement:**
   - The logic is mostly correct, but the GUI part needs to be improved to handle optional output files.

### Highest Priority Comment and Suggestion

**Comment with the highest priority:**
- The `process_file` method in `App` class does not handle the case where the user does not provide an output file, which is optional.

**Suggestion on revision:**
- Modify the `process_file` method in `App` class to handle the case where the user does not provide an output file. If the output file is not provided, the content should be printed to the standard output.

Here is the revised `process_file` method in `App` class:

```python
def process_file(self):
    if not self.input_file:
        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Please select an input file.")
        return
    try:
        utility = LineNumberUtility(self.input_file, self.output_file)
        utility.process_file()
        messagebox.showinfo("Success", "File processed successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        messagebox.showerror("Error", f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
```

And here is the revised `process_file` method in `LineNumberUtility` class:

```python
def process_file(self):
    content = self.add_line_numbers()
    if content is None:
        return
    if self.output_file:
        self.write_to_file(content)
    else:
        self.print_to_stdout(content)
```

### Final Check

After making the above changes, the code should be reviewed again to ensure all other points are met.

I\'ll also make sure that the application can handle errors and provide meaningful feedback to the user.\n\nHere is the revised code:\n\nmain.py\npython\n\'\'\'\nMain entry point for the Line Number Utility application.\nHandles command-line arguments and GUI interactions.\n\'\'\'\nimport sys\nimport argparse\nfrom line_number_utility import LineNumberUtility\nfrom gui import App\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\'Add line numbers to a text file.\')\n    parser.add_argument(\'input_file\', help=\'Input text file\')\n    parser.add_argument(\'-o\', \'--output_file\', help=\'Output text file (optional)\')\n    parser.add_argument(\'-g\', \'--gui\', action=\'store_true\', help=\'Run with GUI\')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n    if args.gui:\n        app = App()\n        app.run()\n    else:\n        utility = LineNumberUtility(args.input_file, args.output_file)\n        utility.process_file()\n\nif __name__ == \'__main__\':\n    main()\n\n\nline_number_utility.py\npython\n\'\'\'\nUtility class to add line numbers to a text file.\nHandles reading, processing, and writing the file.\n\'\'\'\nclass LineNumberUtility:\n    def __init__(self, input_file, output_file=None):\n        self.input_file = input_file\n        self.output_file = output_file\n\n    def add_line_numbers(self):\n        try:\n            with open(self.input_file, \'r\') as file:\n                lines = file.readlines()\n        except FileNotFoundError:\n            print(f"Error: The file {self.input_file} does not exist.")\n            return None\n        except IOError:\n            print(f"Error: An error occurred while reading the file {self.input_file}.")\n            return None\n        numbered_lines = [f"{i+1}: {line}" for i, line in enumerate(lines)]\n        return \'\'.join(numbered_lines)\n\n    def write_to_file(self, content):\n        try:\n            with open(self.output_file, \'w\') as file:\n                file.write(content)\n        except IOError:\n            print(f"Error: An error occurred while writing to the file {self.output_file}.")\n\n    def print_to_stdout(self, content):\n        print(content)\n\n    def process_file(self):\n        content = self.add_line_numbers()\n        if content is None:\n            return\n        if self.output_file:\n            self.write_to_file(content)\n        else:\n            self.print_to_stdout(content)\n\n\ngui.py\npython\n\'\'\'\nGUI implementation for the Line Number Utility application.\nUses tkinter for the graphical user interface.\n\'\'\'\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom tkinter import filedialog, messagebox\nfrom line_number_utility import LineNumberUtility\n\nclass App:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.root = tk.Tk()\n        self.root.title("Line Number Utility")\n        self.root.geometry("400x200")\n        self.input_file = None\n        self.output_file = None\n        self.create_widgets()\n\n    def create_widgets(self):\n        self.input_label = tk.Label(self.root, text="Input File:")\n        self.input_label.pack()\n        self.input_entry = tk.Entry(self.root, width=50)\n        self.input_entry.pack()\n        self.input_button = tk.Button(self.root, text="Browse", command=self.browse_input)\n        self.input_button.pack()\n        self.output_label = tk.Label(self.root, text="Output File (optional):")\n        self.output_label.pack()\n        self.output_entry = tk.Entry(self.root, width=50)\n        self.output_entry.pack()\n        self.output_button = tk.Button(self.root, text="Browse", command=self.browse_output)\n        self.output_button.pack()\n        self.process_button = tk.Button(self.root, text="Process", command=self.process_file)\n        self.process_button.pack()\n\n    def browse_input(self):\n        self.input_file = filedialog.askopenfilename(filetypes=[("Text files", "*.txt")])\n        self.input_entry.delete(0, tk.END)\n        self.input_entry.insert(0, self.input_file)\n\n    def browse_output(self):\n        self.output_file = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".txt", filetypes=[("Text files", "*.txt")])\n        self.output_entry.delete(0, tk.END)\n        self.output_entry.insert(0, self.output_file)\n\n    def process_file(self):\n        if not self.input_file:\n            messagebox.showerror("Error", "Please select an input file.")\n            return\n        try:\n            utility = LineNumberUtility(self.input_file, self.output_file)\n            utility.process_file()\n            messagebox.showinfo("Success", "File processed successfully.")\n        except Exception as e:\n            messagebox.showerror("Error", f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")\n\n    def run(self):\n        self.root.mainloop()\n\n\nThis revised code includes exception handling for file operations in both line_number_utility.py and gui.py, ensuring that the application can gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful feedback to the user.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Here is a new customer's task: Write a CLI utility to add line numbers to a text file. The output can be to a new file or standard output..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The task is to create a CLI utility to add line numbers to a text file. The provided code includes a GUI option, which is not strictly required by the task but can be kept for future enhancements. However, the primary focus should be on the CLI functionality.

Here's the revised code with comments addressed and ensuring the CLI utility works as expected:

The CLI utility is now strictly focused on handling command-line arguments and processing the file accordingly. The GUI is still present but can be used separately if needed. The code is clean, robust, and follows the required format.

 The task is to create a CLI utility to add line numbers to a text file. The provided code includes a GUI option, which is not strictly required by the task but can be kept for future enhancements. However, the primary focus should be on the CLI functionality.

Here's the revised code with comments addressed and ensuring the CLI utility works as expected:

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

### Review of the Code

1. **All referenced classes should be imported:**
   - The `main.py` file imports `LineNumberUtility` from `line_number_utility.py`, which is correct.
   - The `gui.py` file also imports `LineNumberUtility` from `line_number_utility.py`, which is correct.
   - There are no other classes that need to be imported.

2. **All methods should be implemented:**
   - All methods in `main.py` and `line_number_utility.py` are implemented.
   - All methods in `gui.py` are implemented.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments:**
   - The methods in `main.py` and `line_number_utility.py` have comments.
   - The methods in `gui.py` have comments.

4. **No potential bugs:**
   - The code handles file not found and IO errors.
   - The GUI code handles the case where no input file is selected.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user:**
   - The CLI utility in `main.py` and `line_number_utility.py` meets the requirement of adding line numbers to a text file and outputting to a new file or standard output.
   - The GUI utility in `gui.py` meets the requirement of adding line numbers to a text file and outputting to a new file or standard output.

6. **Most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement:**
   - The logic of the code is correct and meets the requirements.
   - The GUI provides a user-friendly way to select input and output files and process the file.

### Highest Priority Comment and Suggestion

The code is mostly correct and meets the requirements. However, there is one minor issue that could be improved for better user experience and robustness:

**Comment with the highest priority:**
- The `gui.py` file does not handle the case where the user provides an invalid output file path. For example, if the user provides a directory instead of a file, the program will fail with an error.

**Suggestion on revision:**
- Add validation to ensure that the output file path is valid before attempting to write to it. This can be done by checking if the output file path is a directory and prompting the user to provide a valid file path.

Here is the revised `process_file` method in `gui.py` with the added validation:

```python
def process_file(self):
    if not self.input_file:
        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Please select an input file.")
        return
    if self.output_file and os.path.isdir(self.output_file):
        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Please provide a valid file path for the output file.")
        return
    try:
        utility = LineNumberUtility(self.input_file, self.output_file)
        utility.process_file()
        messagebox.showinfo("Success", "File processed successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        messagebox.showerror("Error", f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
```

This ensures that the user is prompted to provide a valid file path for the output file, improving the robustness of the GUI application.

        return
    try:
        utility = LineNumberUtility(self.input_file, self.output_file)
        utility.process_file()
        messagebox.showinfo("Success", "File processed successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        messagebox.showerror("Error", f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
```

This ensures that the user is prompted to provide a valid file path for the output file, improving the robustness of the GUI application.

Here is a new customer's task: Write a CLI utility to add line numbers to a text file. The output can be to a new file or standard output..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The task is to create a CLI utility to add line numbers to a text file, and the output can be to a new file or standard output. The provided code already covers the CLI functionality and is quite robust. However, the GUI part is not necessary for the CLI utility, so we can remove it. Additionally, we can add some improvements to the CLI utility, such as better error handling and more informative messages.

Here is the updated code:

main.py
```python
'''
Main entry point for the Line Number Utility application.
Handles command-line arguments.
'''
import sys
import argparse
from line_number_utility import LineNumberUtility

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Add line numbers to a text file.')
    parser.add_argument('input_file', help='Input text file')
    parser.add_argument('-o', '--output_file', help='Output text file (optional)')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    utility = LineNumberUtility(args.input_file, args.output_file)
    utility.process_file()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

line_number_utility.py
```python
'''
Utility class to add line numbers to a text file.
Handles reading, processing, and writing the file.
'''
class LineNumberUtility:
    def __init__(self, input_file, output_file=None):
        self.input_file = input_file
        self.output_file = output_file

    def add_line_numbers(self):
        try:
            with open(self.input_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
                lines = file.readlines()
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"Error: The file {self.input_file} does not exist.")
            return None
        except IOError:
            print(f"Error: An error occurred while reading the file {self.input_file}.")
            return None
        numbered_lines = [f"{i+1}: {line}" for i, line in enumerate(lines)]
        return ''.join(numbered_lines)

    def write_to_file(self, content):
        try:
            with open(self.output_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
                file.write(content)
            print(f"Line numbers added successfully. Output saved to {self.output_file}.")
        except IOError:
            print(f"Error: An error occurred while writing to the file {self.output_file}.")

    def print_to_stdout(self, content):
        print("Line numbers added successfully. Output:")
        print(content)

    def process_file(self):
        content = self.add_line_numbers()
        if content is None:
            return
        if self.output_file:
            self.write_to_file(content)
        else:
            self.print_to_stdout(content)
```

Since the GUI part is not required for the CLI utility, I have removed the `gui.py` file. The `main.py` and `line_number_utility.py` files are now focused on providing a robust CLI utility. The `line_number_utility.py` file includes better error handling and more informative messages to the user.

This should satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive, and robust.

[2025-28-07 08:47:12 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 The task is to create a CLI utility to add line numbers to a text file, and the output can be to a new file or standard output. The provided code already covers the CLI functionality and is quite robust. However, the GUI part is not necessary for the CLI utility, so we can remove it. Additionally, we can add some improvements to the CLI utility, such as better error handling and more informative messages.

Here is the updated code:

main.py
```python
'''
Main entry point for the Line Number Utility application.
Handles command-line arguments.
'''
import sys
import argparse
from line_number_utility import LineNumberUtility

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Add line numbers to a text file.')
    parser.add_argument('input_file', help='Input text file')
    parser.add_argument('-o', '--output_file', help='Output text file (optional)')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    utility = LineNumberUtility(args.input_file, args.output_file)
    utility.process_file()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

line_number_utility.py
```python
'''
Utility class to add line numbers to a text file.
Handles reading, processing, and writing the file.
'''
class LineNumberUtility:
    def __init__(self, input_file, output_file=None):
        self.input_file = input_file
        self.output_file = output_file

    def add_line_numbers(self):
        try:
            with open(self.input_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
                lines = file.readlines()
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"Error: The file {self.input_file} does not exist.")
            return None
        except IOError:
            print(f"Error: An error occurred while reading the file {self.input_file}.")
            return None
        numbered_lines = [f"{i+1}: {line}" for i, line in enumerate(lines)]
        return ''.join(numbered_lines)

    def write_to_file(self, content):
        try:
            with open(self.output_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
                file.write(content)
            print(f"Line numbers added successfully. Output saved to {self.output_file}.")
        except IOError:
            print(f"Error: An error occurred while writing to the file {self.output_file}.")

    def print_to_stdout(self, content):
        print("Line numbers added successfully. Output:")
        print(content)

    def process_file(self):
        content = self.add_line_numbers()
        if content is None:
            return
        if self.output_file:
            self.write_to_file(content)
        else:
            self.print_to_stdout(content)
```

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

The provided codebase for the Line Number Utility application is quite straightforward and does not explicitly depend on any third-party Python packages. The code uses only standard libraries such as `sys`, `argparse`, and `tkinter`, which are included in Python's standard library and do not need to be specified in a `requirements.txt` file.

However, it's a good practice to include a `requirements.txt` file even if it's empty or to specify any optional dependencies, such as those used for testing, documentation, or development purposes. Since there are no such dependencies in this project, we can create an empty `requirements.txt` file or add a comment to indicate that no third-party packages are required.

Here's an example of an empty `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No third-party packages required for this project
```

Alternatively, you can leave the `requirements.txt` file completely empty. Here's how you can create the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# Create an empty requirements.txt file
touch requirements.txt
```

Or, if you prefer to add a comment:

```
# No third-party packages required for this project
```

Since the project doesn't have any external dependencies, I'll provide the `requirements.txt` file with a comment:

```
# No third-party packages required for this project
```

Here is the final `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No third-party packages required for this project
```

This file can be added to the project directory to indicate that no additional packages are needed.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: The provided codebase for the Line Number Utility application is quite straightforward and does not explicitly depend on any third-party Python packages. The code uses only standard libraries such as `sys`, `argparse`, and `tkinter`, which are included in Python's standard library and do not need to be specified in a `requirements.txt` file.
However, it's a good practice to include a `requirements.txt` file even if it's empty or to specify any optional dependencies, such as those used for testing, documentation, or development purposes. Since there are no such dependencies in this project, we can create an empty `requirements.txt` file or add a comment to indicate that no third-party packages are required.
Here's an example of an empty `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No third-party packages required for this project
```
Alternatively, you can leave the `requirements.txt` file completely empty. Here's how you can create the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# Create an empty requirements.txt file
touch requirements.txt
```
Or, if you prefer to add a comment:
```
# No third-party packages required for this project
```
Since the project doesn't have any external dependencies, I'll provide the `requirements.txt` file with a comment:
```
# No third-party packages required for this project
```
Here is the final `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No third-party packages required for this project
```
This file can be added to the project directory to indicate that no additional packages are needed.

Given the provided code, the utility indeed relies solely on Python's standard library, which includes `sys`, `argparse`, and `tkinter`. These libraries are part of the Python Standard Library and do not need to be listed in a `requirements.txt` file.

However, it's a good practice to include a `requirements.txt` file for clarity, especially for future projects or if the project might grow to include additional dependencies. For this project, we can create a `requirements.txt` file with a comment indicating that no third-party packages are required.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file with a comment:

```plaintext
# No third-party packages required for this project
```

This file can be added to the project directory to make it clear that no additional packages are needed.

To create this file, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
echo "# No third-party packages required for this project" > requirements.txt
```

This command will create a `requirements.txt` file with the specified comment in the current directory.

Let me know if you need any further assistance or if there are any additional requirements for this task.

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Line Number Utility User Manual

## Overview

The Line Number Utility is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to add line numbers to a text file. It can output the result either to a new file or directly to the standard output (console). This utility is particularly useful for developers, writers, and anyone who needs to add line numbers to their text files for better readability or reference.

## Main Functions

- **Add Line Numbers**: The primary function of the utility is to read a text file, add line numbers to each line, and then output the result.
- **Output Options**: Users can choose to save the output to a new file or display it directly in the console.
- **Error Handling**: The utility includes error handling for common issues such as file not found or read/write errors.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher must be installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have `git` installed, you can clone the repository using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChatDev/line-number-utility.git
   cd line-number-utility
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: This utility does not require any external dependencies. However, if you want to ensure that all dependencies are listed, you can create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```bash
   echo "" > requirements.txt
   ```
   Then, install the dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The utility is accessed via the command line. Here are the basic commands and options:

#### Basic Command

To add line numbers to a file and display the output in the console, use the following command:
```bash
