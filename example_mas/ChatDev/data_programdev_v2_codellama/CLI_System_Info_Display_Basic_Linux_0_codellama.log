I understand the new customer's request and the product modality options available. As the Chief Product Officer, I suggest we focus on creating a CLI tool that displays basic system information on Linux, such as OS version, kernel version, CPU model, and total RAM. This tool can be implemented using Python and can be easily integrated into the existing product lineup.

To satisfy the customer's demand and ensure the product is realizable, I propose we create a CLI tool that uses system files in /proc or commands like `uname` to display the required information. This tool can be designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, with clear and concise output that is easy to understand.

I believe this product modality is the best fit for our existing product lineup and will meet the customer's needs. I suggest we proceed with this product modality and begin working on the tool.

I concur with your proposal. As the Chief Product Officer, I believe that a CLI tool that displays basic system information on Linux, such as OS version, kernel version, CPU model, and total RAM, is the best fit for our existing product lineup and will meet the customer's needs.

To ensure that the tool is user-friendly and easy to use, I suggest we design it to have clear and concise output that is easy to understand. We can also consider adding additional features, such as the ability to display more detailed information or the ability to filter the output based on specific criteria.

Here is a conversation between two roles: Chief Executive Officer: ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a CLI tool to display basic system information on Linux, such as OS version, kernel version, CPU model, and total RAM. Use system files in /proc or commands like `uname`..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.

Chief Executive Officer: ChatDev has made products in the following form before:
Image: can present information in line chart, bar chart, flow chart, cloud chart, Gantt chart, etc.
Document: can present information via .docx files.
PowerPoint: can present information via .pptx files.
Excel: can present information via .xlsx files.
PDF: can present information via .pdf files.
Website: can present personal resume, tutorial, products, or ideas, via .html files.
Application: can implement visualized game, software, tool, etc, via python.
Dashboard: can display a panel visualizing real-time information.
Mind Map: can represent ideas, with related concepts arranged around a core concept.
As the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?
Note that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> PowerPoint".

Chief Product Officer: I understand the new customer's request and the product modality options available. As the Chief Product Officer, I suggest we focus on creating a CLI tool that displays basic system information on Linux, such as OS version, kernel version, CPU model, and total RAM. This tool can be implemented using Python and can be easily integrated into the existing product lineup.
To satisfy the customer's demand and ensure the product is realizable, I propose we create a CLI tool that uses system files in /proc or commands like `uname` to display the required information. This tool can be designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, with clear and concise output that is easy to understand.
I believe this product modality is the best fit for our existing product lineup and will meet the customer's needs. I suggest we proceed with this product modality and begin working on the tool.

I concur with your proposal. As the Chief Product Officer, I believe that a CLI tool that displays basic system information on Linux, such as OS version, kernel version, CPU model, and total RAM, is the best fit for our existing product lineup and will meet the customer's needs.
To ensure that the tool is user-friendly and easy to use, I suggest we design it to have clear and concise output that is easy to understand. We can also consider adding additional features, such as the ability to display more detailed information or the ability to filter the output based on specific criteria.

Here is a conversation between two roles: Chief Executive Officer: ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a CLI tool to display basic system information on Linux, such as OS version, kernel version, CPU model, and total RAM. Use system files in /proc or commands like `uname`..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.

Chief Executive Officer: According to the new user's task and some creative brainstorm ideas listed below: 
Task: "Create a CLI tool to display basic system information on Linux, such as OS version, kernel version, CPU model, and total RAM. Use system files in /proc or commands like `uname`.".
Modality: "[inst]".
Ideas: "".
We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 
As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).
Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below:

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  *. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here is a proposed solution for the CLI tool to display basic system information on Linux:

1. main.py
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import argparse
import sys

from . import display_info

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Display basic system information on Linux.')
    parser.add_argument('-v', '--version', action='store_true', help='display OS version')
    parser.add_argument('-k', '--kernel', action='store_true', help='display kernel version')
    parser.add_argument('-c', '--cpu', action='store_true', help='display CPU model')
    parser.add_argument('-r', '--ram', action='store_true', help='display total RAM')
    args = parser.parse_args()

    if args.version:
        display_info.display_os_version()
    elif args.kernel:
        display_info.display_kernel_version()
    elif args.cpu:
        display_info.display_cpu_model()
    elif args.ram:
        display_info.display_total_ram()
    else:
        parser.print_help()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
2. display_info.py
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import subprocess

def display_os_version():
    version = subprocess.check_output(['uname', '-s']).decode().strip()
    print(f'OS version: {version}')

def display_kernel_version():
    version = subprocess.check_output(['uname', '-r']).decode().strip()
    print(f'Kernel version: {version}')

def display_cpu_model():
    model = subprocess.check_output(['cat', '/proc/cpuinfo']).decode().strip()
    print(f'CPU model: {model}')

def display_total_ram():
    total_ram = subprocess.check_output(['cat', '/proc/meminfo']).decode().strip()
    print(f'Total RAM: {total_ram}')
```
3. cli.py
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import argparse
import sys

from . import main

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Display basic system information on Linux.')
    parser.add_argument('-v', '--version', action='store_true', help='display OS version')
    parser.add_argument('-k', '--kernel', action='store_true', help='display kernel version')
    parser.add_argument('-c', '--cpu', action='store_true', help='display CPU model')
    parser.add_argument('-r', '--ram', action='store_true', help='display total RAM')
    args = parser.parse_args()

    if args.version:
        main.display_os_version()
    elif args.kernel:
        main.display_kernel_version()
    elif args.cpu:
        main.display_cpu_model()
    elif args.ram:
        main.display_total_ram()
    else:
        parser.print_help()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
4. Makefile
```makefile
all: cli

cli: main.py display_info.py cli.py
    python3 main.py

clean:
    rm -f cli
```

This solution uses the `subprocess` module to execute the `uname` command and parse the output. The `display_info` module contains functions to display the OS version, kernel version, CPU model, and total RAM. The `cli` module is the main entry point for the CLI tool, and it uses the `argparse` module to parse the command-line arguments. The `Makefile` is used to build the CLI tool.

To use the CLI tool, run the following command:
```
$ make cli
```
This will build the CLI tool and run it with the default options. To display the OS version, run the following command:
```
$ make cli -v
```
To display the kernel version, run the following command:
```
$ make cli -k
```
To display the CPU model, run the following command:

[2025-29-07 03:57:32 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 Here is a proposed solution for the CLI tool to display basic system information on Linux:

1. main.py
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import argparse
import sys

from . import display_info

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Display basic system information on Linux.')
    parser.add_argument('-v', '--version', action='store_true', help='display OS version')
    parser.add_argument('-k', '--kernel', action='store_true', help='display kernel version')
    parser.add_argument('-c', '--cpu', action='store_true', help='display CPU model')
    parser.add_argument('-r', '--ram', action='store_true', help='display total RAM')
    args = parser.parse_args()

    if args.version:
        display_info.display_os_version()
    elif args.kernel:
        display_info.display_kernel_version()
    elif args.cpu:
        display_info.display_cpu_model()
    elif args.ram:
        display_info.display_total_ram()
    else:
        parser.print_help()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
2. display_info.py
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import subprocess

def display_os_version():
    version = subprocess.check_output(['uname', '-s']).decode().strip()
    print(f'OS version: {version}')

def display_kernel_version():
    version = subprocess.check_output(['uname', '-r']).decode().strip()
    print(f'Kernel version: {version}')

def display_cpu_model():
    model = subprocess.check_output(['cat', '/proc/cpuinfo']).decode().strip()
    print(f'CPU model: {model}')

def display_total_ram():
    total_ram = subprocess.check_output(['cat', '/proc/meminfo']).decode().strip()
    print(f'Total RAM: {total_ram}')
```
3. cli.py
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import argparse
import sys

from . import main

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Display basic system information on Linux.')
    parser.add_argument('-v', '--version', action='store_true', help='display OS version')
    parser.add_argument('-k', '--kernel', action='store_true', help='display kernel version')
    parser.add_argument('-c', '--cpu', action='store_true', help='display CPU model')
    parser.add_argument('-r', '--ram', action='store_true', help='display total RAM')
    args = parser.parse_args()

    if args.version:
        main.display_os_version()
    elif args.kernel:
        main.display_kernel_version()
    elif args.cpu:
        main.display_cpu_model()
    elif args.ram:
        main.display_total_ram()
    else:
        parser.print_help()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
4. Makefile
```makefile
all: cli

cli: main.py display_info.py cli.py
    python3 main.py

clean:
    rm -f cli
```

This solution uses the `subprocess` module to execute the `uname` command and parse the output. The `display_info` module contains functions to display the OS version, kernel version, CPU model, and total RAM. The `cli` module is the main entry point for the CLI tool, and it uses the `argparse` module to parse the command-line arguments. The `Makefile` is used to build the CLI tool.

To use the CLI tool, run the following command:
```
$ make cli
```
This will build the CLI tool and run it with the default options. To display the OS version, run the following command:
```
$ make cli -v
```
To display the kernel version, run the following command:
```
$ make cli -k
```
To display the CPU model, run the following command:
```
$ make cli -c
```
To display the total RAM, run the following command:
```
$ make cli -r
```
You can also use the `--help` option to display the help message for the CLI tool:
```
$ make cli --help
```

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a CLI tool to display basic system information on Linux, such as OS version, kernel version, CPU model, and total RAM. Use system files in /proc or commands like `uname`..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

1. All referenced classes should be imported:
The code is missing imports for the `argparse` and `subprocess` modules. These modules should be imported at the beginning of the file.

2. All methods should be implemented:
The `display_os_version`, `display_kernel_version`, `display_cpu_model`, and `display_total_ram` methods are not implemented. These methods should be implemented to display the requested information.

3. All methods need to have the necessary comments:
The code is missing comments for the `display_os_version`, `display_kernel_version`, `display_cpu_model`, and `display_total_ram` methods. These methods should have comments that explain what they do and how they work.

4. No potential bugs:
The code has a potential bug in the `display_total_ram` method. The `total_ram` variable is not defined, which will cause an error when the method is called.

5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user:
The code does not conform to the tasks proposed by the user. The user requested a CLI tool to display basic system information on Linux, but the code only displays the OS version.

6. Most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement:
The code does not provide a way for the user to interact with the generated software. The user should be able to use the CLI tool to display basic system information on Linux.

Based on the above regulations, I would suggest the following comment with the highest priority:

"The code is missing imports for the `argparse` and `subprocess` modules, and the `display_os_version`, `display_kernel_version`, `display_cpu_model`, and `display_total_ram` methods are not implemented. The code also has a potential bug in the `display_total_ram` method, and it does not conform to the tasks proposed by the user. The code should be modified to import the necessary modules, implement the missing methods, fix the bug, and provide a way for the user to interact with the generated software."

Instructions on how to fix the code:

1. Import the `argparse` and `subprocess` modules at the beginning of the file.
2. Implement the `display_os_version`, `display_kernel_version`, `display_cpu_model`, and `display_total_ram` methods.
3. Fix the bug in the `display_total_ram` method by defining the `total_ram` variable.
4. Provide a way for the user to interact with the generated software by adding a main function that parses the command-line arguments and calls the appropriate methods.
5. Modify the code to conform to the tasks proposed by the user by displaying basic system information on Linux.

Comments on Codes:
"1. All referenced classes should be imported:
The code is missing imports for the `argparse` and `subprocess` modules. These modules should be imported at the beginning of the file.

2. All methods should be implemented:
The `display_os_version`, `display_kernel_version`, `display_cpu_model`, and `display_total_ram` methods are not implemented. These methods should be implemented to display the requested information.

3. All methods need to have the necessary comments:
The code is missing comments for the `display_os_version`, `display_kernel_version`, `display_cpu_model`, and `display_total_ram` methods. These methods should have comments that explain what they do and how they work.

4. No potential bugs:
The code has a potential bug in the `display_total_ram` method. The `total_ram` variable is not defined, which will cause an error when the method is called.

5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user:
The code does not conform to the tasks proposed by the user. The user requested a CLI tool to display basic system information on Linux, but the code only displays the OS version.

6. Most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement:
The code does not provide a way for the user to interact with the generated software. The user should be able to use the CLI tool to display basic system information on Linux.

Based on the above regulations, I would suggest the following comment with the highest priority:

"The code is missing imports for the `argparse` and `subprocess` modules, and the `display_os_version`, `display_kernel_version`, `display_cpu_model`, and `display_total_ram` methods are not implemented. The code also has a potential bug in the `display_total_ram` method, and it does not conform to the tasks proposed by the user. The code should be modified to import the necessary modules, implement the missing methods, fix the bug, and provide a way for the user to interact with the generated software."

Instructions on how to fix the code:

1. Import the `argparse` and `subprocess` modules at the beginning of the file.
2. Implement the `display_os_version`, `display_kernel_version`, `display_cpu_model`, and `display_total_ram` methods.
3. Fix the bug in the `display_total_ram` method by defining the `total_ram` variable.
4. Provide a way for the user to interact with the generated software by adding a main function that parses the command-line arguments and calls the appropriate methods.
5. Modify the code to conform to the tasks proposed by the user by displaying basic system information on Linux."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a CLI tool to display basic system information on Linux, such as OS version, kernel version, CPU model, and total RAM. Use system files in /proc or commands like `uname`..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

1. All referenced classes should be imported:
The code is missing imports for the `argparse` and `subprocess` modules. These modules should be imported at the beginning of the file.

2. All methods should be implemented:
The `display_os_version()`, `display_kernel_version()`, `display_cpu_model()`, and `display_total_ram()` methods are not implemented. These methods should be implemented to display the requested information.

3. All methods need to have the necessary comments:
The code is missing comments for the `main()` function and the `display_info()` function. These functions should be commented to explain their purpose and how they work.

4. No potential bugs:
The code has a potential bug in the `display_total_ram()` method. The `total_ram` variable is not defined, and the `cat` command is not used correctly. The `total_ram` variable should be defined as `total_ram = subprocess.check_output(['cat', '/proc/meminfo']).decode().strip()` and the `cat` command should be used as `total_ram = subprocess.check_output(['cat', '/proc/meminfo']).decode().strip()`.

5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user:
The code does not conform to the tasks proposed by the user. The code should display the requested information, which is OS version, kernel version, CPU model, and total RAM.

6. Most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement:
The code does not provide a way for the user to interact with the generated software. The code should include a way for the user to select which information to display and how to display it.

Based on the above regulations, I would suggest the following comment with the highest priority:

"The code is missing imports for the `argparse` and `subprocess` modules, and the `display_os_version()`, `display_kernel_version()`, `display_cpu_model()`, and `display_total_ram()` methods are not implemented. The code also has a potential bug in the `display_total_ram()` method. The code should include comments for the `main()` function and the `display_info()` function. The code should display the requested information, which is OS version, kernel version, CPU model, and total RAM. The code should also provide a way for the user to interact with the generated software."

To fix the code, the missing imports should be added, the `display_os_version()`, `display_kernel_version()`, `display_cpu_model()`, and `display_total_ram()` methods should be implemented, and the `total_ram` variable should be defined correctly. The code should also include comments for the `main()` function and the `display_info()` function. Finally, the code should display the requested information, which is OS version, kernel version, CPU model, and total RAM.

Comments on Codes:
"1. All referenced classes should be imported:
The code is missing imports for the `argparse` and `subprocess` modules. These modules should be imported at the beginning of the file.

2. All methods should be implemented:
The `display_os_version()`, `display_kernel_version()`, `display_cpu_model()`, and `display_total_ram()` methods are not implemented. These methods should be implemented to display the requested information.

3. All methods need to have the necessary comments:
The code is missing comments for the `main()` function and the `display_info()` function. These functions should be commented to explain their purpose and how they work.

4. No potential bugs:
The code has a potential bug in the `display_total_ram()` method. The `total_ram` variable is not defined, and the `cat` command is not used correctly. The `total_ram` variable should be defined as `total_ram = subprocess.check_output(['cat', '/proc/meminfo']).decode().strip()` and the `cat` command should be used as `total_ram = subprocess.check_output(['cat', '/proc/meminfo']).decode().strip()`.

5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user:
The code does not conform to the tasks proposed by the user. The code should display the requested information, which is OS version, kernel version, CPU model, and total RAM.

6. Most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement:
The code does not provide a way for the user to interact with the generated software. The code should include a way for the user to select which information to display and how to display it.

Based on the above regulations, I would suggest the following comment with the highest priority:

"The code is missing imports for the `argparse` and `subprocess` modules, and the `display_os_version()`, `display_kernel_version()`, `display_cpu_model()`, and `display_total_ram()` methods are not implemented.

The code should also provide a way for the user to interact with the generated software."

To fix the code, the missing imports should be added, the `display_os_version()`, `display_kernel_version()`, `display_cpu_model()`, and `display_total_ram()` methods should be implemented, and the `total_ram` variable should be defined correctly. The code should also include comments for the `main()` function and the `display_info()` function. Finally, the code should display the requested information, which is OS version, kernel version, CPU model, and total RAM."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The `main` function is missing the implementation of the `display_os_version`, `display_kernel_version`, `display_cpu_model`, and `display_total_ram` methods. Please add the following lines to the `main` function:
```python
if args.version:
    display_os_version()
elif args.kernel:
    display_kernel_version()
elif args.cpu:
    display_cpu_model()
elif args.ram:

3. All methods need to have the necessary comments:
The `display_os_version`, `display_kernel_version`, `display_cpu_model`, and `display_total_ram` methods are missing comments. Please add comments to each method to explain what it does and how it works.
4. No potential bugs:
The code has a potential bug in the `display_total_ram` method. The `total_ram` variable is not defined. Please define the variable and use it in the `print` statement.
5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user:
The code does not conform to the tasks proposed by the user. The code should display the basic system information on Linux, such as OS version, kernel version, CPU model, and total RAM. Please modify the code to meet the user's requirements.
6. Most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that the user can interact with the generated software without losing any feature in the requirement:
The code does not provide a way for the user to interact with the generated software. Please add a command-line interface to the code to allow the user to interact with the software.

Comments on Codes:
"1. All referenced classes should be imported:
The code is missing the import statement for the `argparse` module. Please add the following line at the top of the file:
```python

```
2. All methods should be implemented:
The `main` function is missing the implementation of the `display_os_version`, `display_kernel_version`, `display_cpu_model`, and `display_total_ram` methods. Please add the following lines to the `main` function:
```python
if args.version:
    display_os_version()
elif args.kernel:
    display_kernel_version()
elif args.cpu:
    display_cpu_model()
elif args.ram:

3. All methods need to have the necessary comments:
The `display_os_version`, `display_kernel_version`, `display_cpu_model`, and `display_total_ram` methods are missing comments. Please add comments to each method to explain what it does and how it works.
4. No potential bugs:
The code has a potential bug in the `display_total_ram` method. The `total_ram` variable is not defined. Please define the variable and use it in the `print` statement.
5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user:
The code does not conform to the tasks proposed by the user. The code should display the basic system information on Linux, such as OS version, kernel version, CPU model, and total RAM. Please modify the code to meet the user's requirements.
6. Most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that the user can interact with the generated software without losing any feature in the requirement:
The code does not provide a way for the user to interact with the generated software. Please add a command-line interface to the code to allow the user to interact with the software.

Overall, the code needs significant improvement to meet the user's requirements. Please make the necessary changes and add the necessary comments to the code."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

The error message you provided indicates that there is an issue with the import statement in the `main.py` file. Specifically, the error message states that the import statement is attempting a relative import with no known parent package.

To fix this issue, you can try the following:

1. Check the file path of the `main.py` file and make sure it is correct.
2. Check the file path of the `display_info.py` file and make sure it is correct.
3. Check the import statement in the `main.py` file and make sure it is correct.
4. Check the import statement in the `display_info.py` file and make sure it is correct.
5. If the issue persists, try to use the absolute import statement instead of the relative import statement.

For example, instead of using `from . import main`, you can use `from display_info import display_os_version, display_kernel_version, display_cpu_model, display_total_ram`.

By making these changes, you should be able to fix the issue and run the program successfully.

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Here is a sample `requirements.txt` file based on the codes and file format listed above:
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
This `requirements.txt` file specifies that the project requires `numpy` version `1.19.2` and `pandas` version `1.1.4` or higher.
Note that this is just an example and the actual requirements may vary depending on the specific project and its dependencies. It's always a good practice to keep the `requirements.txt` file up-to-date and accurate to ensure that the project runs properly on different environments.
