I understand the new customer's request and the product modality options available. To satisfy the customer's demand and the product's feasibility, let's discuss the product modality and reach a unanimous decision.

As the Chief Product Officer, I suggest we consider the following product modalities:

1. CLI Dictionary Lookup Tool: This modality is the most straightforward and efficient way to implement the customer's request. It allows users to input a word and receive its definition in a text-based interface.
2. PowerPoint Presentation: This modality provides a visual and interactive way to present the dictionary definitions. It can be used to create a presentation that includes the definitions and related information.
3. Website: This modality allows us to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to input a word and receive its definition. It can be hosted on a website and accessed from any device with an internet connection.

Let's discuss and decide on the product modality that best meets the customer's needs and our company's goals. Once we have reached a unanimous decision, please reply with "<INFO> [Product Modality]" to terminate the discussion.

As the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?
Note that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> PowerPoint".

Chief Product Officer: I understand the new customer's request and the product modality options available. To satisfy the customer's demand and the product's feasibility, let's discuss the product modality and reach a unanimous decision.
As the Chief Product Officer, I suggest we consider the following product modalities:
1. CLI Dictionary Lookup Tool: This modality is the most straightforward and efficient way to implement the customer's request. It allows users to input a word and receive its definition in a text-based interface.
2. PowerPoint Presentation: This modality provides a visual and interactive way to present the dictionary definitions. It can be used to create a presentation that includes the definitions and related information.
3. Website: This modality allows us to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to input a word and receive its definition. It can be hosted on a website and accessed from any device with an internet connection.
Let's discuss and decide on the product modality that best meets the customer's needs and our company's goals. Once we have reached a unanimous decision, please reply with "<INFO> [Product Modality]" to terminate the discussion.

Chief Executive Officer: I agree with your suggestions. Let's discuss each modality in detail to determine which one is the best fit for our customer's needs and our company's goals.
1. CLI Dictionary Lookup Tool:
This modality is the most straightforward and efficient way to implement the customer's request. It allows users to input a word and receive its definition in a text-based interface. This modality is simple to implement and does not require any additional software or hardware. However, it may not be as visually appealing as other modalities.
2. PowerPoint Presentation:
This modality provides a visual and interactive way to present the dictionary definitions. It can be used to create a presentation that includes the definitions and related information. This modality is more visually appealing than the CLI modality and can be used to create a more engaging and interactive experience for the user. However, it may require additional software and hardware to create and present the presentation.
3. Website:
This modality allows us to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to input a word and receive its definition. It can be hosted on a website and accessed from any device with an internet connection. This modality is more user-friendly than the CLI and PowerPoint modalities and can be used to create a more accessible and user-friendly experience for the user. However, it may require additional software and hardware to host and maintain the website.

Here is a conversation between two roles: Chief Executive Officer: ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.

To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.

Chief Executive Officer: According to the new user's task and some creative brainstorm ideas listed below:

Ideas: "".
We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 
As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).
Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: Write a CLI dictionary lookup tool that uses a local, offline dictionary file (e.g., a plain text file with word:definition format). User inputs a word, tool displays definition..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. {gui} Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right. You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose. Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code: FILENAME ```LANGUAGE ''' DOCSTRING ''' CODE ``` You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on. Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python). |

Programming Language: " *"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  *. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Write a CLI dictionary lookup tool that uses a local, offline dictionary file (e.g., a plain text file with word:definition format). User inputs a word, tool displays definition..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here is a suggested outline for the files and their contents:

1. main.py
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import argparse
import sys

from dictionary import Dictionary

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='CLI dictionary lookup tool')
    parser.add_argument('word', help='word to look up')
    args = parser.parse_args()

    dictionary = Dictionary()
    definition = dictionary.lookup(args.word)

    if definition:
        print(definition)
    else:
        print(f'No definition found for "{args.word}"')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
2. dictionary.py
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os

class Dictionary:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dictionary_file = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'dictionary.txt')
        self.dictionary = self.load_dictionary()

    def load_dictionary(self):
        with open(self.dictionary_file, 'r') as f:
            return {line.split(':')[0]: line.split(':')[1] for line in f.readlines()}

    def lookup(self, word):
        return self.dictionary.get(word)
```
3. dictionary.txt
```
apple: a round fruit
banana: a curved fruit
orange: a citrus fruit
```

Note: The `dictionary.txt` file is a plain text file with word:definition format, where each line represents a word and its definition. The `dictionary.py` file contains the `Dictionary` class, which loads the dictionary file and provides a `lookup` method to retrieve the definition of a given word. The `main.py` file parses the command-line arguments, creates a `Dictionary` object, and retrieves the definition of the specified word.

<INFO> Finished. The codes meet all the requirements and are well-structured. The only suggestion I have is to add a check for the user input to ensure that it is a valid word and not an empty string. This can be done by adding a check in the `main()` function before calling the `lookup()` method.

Here is the updated code:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='CLI dictionary lookup tool')
    parser.add_argument('word', help='word to look up')

" Finished. The codes meet all the requirements and are well-structured. The only suggestion I have is to add a check for the user input to ensure that it is a valid word and not an empty string. This can be done by adding a check in the `main()` function before calling the `lookup()` method.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<INFO> Finished.

The provided codes meet all the requirements and are well-structured. The only suggestion I have is to add a check for the user input to ensure that it is a valid word and not an empty string. This can be done by adding a check in the `main()` function before calling the `lookup()` method.

Here is the updated code:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import argparse
import sys
from dictionary import Dictionary

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='CLI dictionary lookup tool')
    parser.add_argument('word', help='word to look up')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    dictionary = Dictionary()
    if args.word:
        definition = dictionary.lookup(args.word)
        if definition:
            print(definition)
        else:
            print(f'No definition found for "{args.word}"')
    else:
        print('Please enter a valid word')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

I have added a check to ensure that the user input is not an empty string before calling the `lookup()` method. This will prevent the program from crashing if the user enters an empty string.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Write a CLI dictionary lookup tool that uses a local, offline dictionary file (e.g., a plain text file with word:definition format). User inputs a word, tool displays definition..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task, our designed product modality, languages and ideas, our developed first-edition source codes are listed below:

The provided codes meet all the requirements and are well-structured. The only suggestion I have is to add a check for the user input to ensure that it is a valid word and not an empty string. This can be done by adding a check in the `main()` function before calling the `lookup()` method.

Here is the updated code:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import argparse
import sys
from dictionary import Dictionary

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='CLI dictionary lookup tool')
    parser.add_argument('word', help='word to look up')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    dictionary = Dictionary()
    if args.word:
        definition = dictionary.lookup(args.word)
        if definition:
            print(definition)
        else:
            print(f'No definition found for "{args.word}"')
    else:
        print('Please enter a valid word')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

I have added a check to ensure that the user input is not an empty string before calling the `lookup()` method. This will prevent the program from crashing if the user enters an empty string.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
