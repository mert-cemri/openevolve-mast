The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about machine_learning. Think step by step and then output the answer in the format of "The answer is (X)" at the end. X is the index of the answer (either 0, 1, 2, or 3) 

Question: Statement 1| The SVM learning algorithm is guaranteed to find the globally optimal hypothesis with respect to its object function. Statement 2| After being mapped into feature space Q through a radial basis kernel function, a Perceptron may be able to achieve better classification performance than in its original space (though we can’t guarantee this).

0. True, True
1. False, False
2. True, False
3. False, True

Answer: 

Correct answer index: 0
