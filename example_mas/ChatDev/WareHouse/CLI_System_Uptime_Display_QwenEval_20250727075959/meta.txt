Language:
 Given the task of building a CLI tool that displays system uptime using the `uptime` command on Linux, we have evaluated several programming languages based on the criteria of ease of use, support for executing system commands, and packaging and distribution capabilities.

1. **Python**:
   - **Ease of Use**: High. Python is known for its simplicity and readability, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.
   - **Support for Executing System Commands**: High. Python's `subprocess` module provides a powerful interface for spawning new processes, connecting to their input/output/error pipes, and obtaining their return codes.
   - **Packaging and Distribution**: High. Python has tools like `setuptools` and `pip` that make it easy to package and distribute applications. Additionally, `PyInstaller` can be used to create standalone executables.

2. **C/C++**:
   - **Ease of Use**: Low. C/C++ are powerful languages but have a steeper learning curve and require more boilerplate code.
   - **Support for Executing System Commands**: Moderate. C/C++ can execute system commands using functions like `system()` or `popen()`, but these require more manual handling.
   - **Packaging and Distribution**: Moderate. C/C++ applications can be compiled into executables, but packaging and distribution can be more complex compared to Python.

3. **Java**:
   - **Ease of Use**: Moderate. Java is a robust language with a large ecosystem, but it might be overkill for a simple CLI tool.
   - **Support for Executing System Commands**: Moderate. Java can execute system commands using `ProcessBuilder` or `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`.
   - **Packaging and Distribution**: Moderate. Java applications can be packaged into JAR files, but they require a JVM to run, which can be a drawback for a simple CLI tool.

4. **Bash/Shell Script**:
   - **Ease of Use**: High. Bash/Shell scripts are native to Linux and can execute system commands directly, making them easy to write and understand.
   - **Support for Executing System Commands**: High. Bash/Shell scripts can execute system commands directly using backticks or `$()`.
   - **Packaging and Distribution**: Moderate. Bash/Shell scripts are easy to distribute, but they might not be as portable or maintainable as a Python script.

Considering all these factors, Python remains the best choice for this task due to its simplicity, readability, and the ease with which it can be packaged and distributed.

Therefore, the programming language being discussed for software development is:
