As the Chief Product Officer, I would recommend creating a comprehensive user manual for the software, including the following sections:

1. Introduction: Provide an overview of the software and its purpose, as well as any relevant background information.
2. Installation: Clearly outline the steps for installing the software, including any necessary dependencies or prerequisites.
3. Getting Started: Provide a simple example of how to use the software, as well as any necessary configuration or setup steps.
4. How-To Examples: Provide a series of step-by-step guides on how to perform specific tasks using the software, such as building a question answering system over specific documents.
5. Reference: Provide a detailed reference guide for the software, including a full API documentation.
6. Resources: Provide a high-level explanation of the core concepts and technologies used in the software, as well as any relevant research or publications.
7. Troubleshooting: Provide a list of common issues and solutions for troubleshooting the software.
8. Contributing: Provide information on how to contribute to the development of the software, including any necessary coding standards or guidelines.
9. License: Provide information on the software's license and any relevant copyright information.

By including these sections in the user manual, users will be able to quickly and easily get started with the software, as well as understand how to use it for a variety of tasks. Additionally, the manual will provide a comprehensive reference guide for advanced users, as well as a list of resources for further learning and development.
