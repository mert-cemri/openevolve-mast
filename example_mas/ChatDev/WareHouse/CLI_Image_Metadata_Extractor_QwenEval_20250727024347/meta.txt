Task:
Create a CLI tool to extract and display basic metadata (e.g., resolution, format, creation date if available) from image files (JPEG, PNG). The user provides the image file path.

Ideas:


Language:
 1. **Ease of Use and Learning Curve**: Python is known for its readability and ease of use, which makes it a great choice for rapid development.
2. **Libraries and Ecosystem**: Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries that can handle image processing and metadata extraction. Libraries like Pillow (PIL Fork) and ExifRead are specifically designed for these tasks.
3. **Community Support**: Python has a large and active community, which means there are plenty of resources, tutorials, and forums available for troubleshooting and learning.
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Python is cross-platform, which means the CLI tool can be developed once and run on multiple operating systems without modification.
5. **Performance**: While Python is not the fastest language, for this specific task, performance is not a critical factor. The efficiency of the libraries used will ensure that the tool performs well.

Given these points, Python is indeed an excellent choice for developing a CLI tool to extract and display basic metadata from image files.
