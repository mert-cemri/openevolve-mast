The task is to build a CLI (Command Line Interface) number guessing game. Given the options provided, the most suitable modality would be an Application, specifically a command-line application. This aligns perfectly with the requirement for a CLI game, as it allows for the implementation of a software tool that runs in a terminal or command prompt environment.

Considering the user's needs and the nature of the task, the Application modality is the most appropriate choice. It allows for the creation of a functional, interactive game that can be easily executed and played by users through a command-line interface.

Let's finalize this decision together. Do you agree with the Application modality for this CLI number guessing game?

Chief Executive Officer: ChatDev has made products in the following form before:
Image: can present information in line chart, bar chart, flow chart, cloud chart, Gantt chart, etc.
Document: can present information via .docx files.
PowerPoint: can present information via .pptx files.
Excel: can present information via .xlsx files.
PDF: can present information via .pdf files.
Website: can present personal resume, tutorial, products, or ideas, via .html files.
Application: can implement visualized game, software, tool, etc, via python.
Dashboard: can display a panel visualizing real-time information.
Mind Map: can represent ideas, with related concepts arranged around a core concept.
As the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?
Note that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> PowerPoint".

Chief Product Officer: The task is to build a CLI (Command Line Interface) number guessing game. Given the options provided, the most suitable modality would be an Application, specifically a command-line application. This aligns perfectly with the requirement for a CLI game, as it allows for the implementation of a software tool that runs in a terminal or command prompt environment.
Considering the user's needs and the nature of the task, the Application modality is the most appropriate choice. It allows for the creation of a functional, interactive game that can be easily executed and played by users through a command-line interface.
Let's finalize this decision together. Do you agree with the Application modality for this CLI number guessing game?
<INFO> Application

Chief Executive Officer: Given the task of building a CLI number guessing game, the Application modality is indeed the most suitable choice. This modality allows for the creation of a software tool that can be executed in a terminal or command prompt environment, which perfectly aligns with the requirement for a CLI game.
The Application modality encompasses the development of interactive software, which is exactly what we need for this project. It enables us to implement the game logic, handle user input, and provide feedback through the command line interface.
