Pros:

* Easy to use and understand
* Can be used in any operating system
* Can be integrated with other CLI tools

Cons:

* Limited visualization capabilities
* May not be as visually appealing as a GUI maze generator
3. Maze Game:

You are responsible for all product-related matters in ChatDev. Usually includes product design, product strategy, product vision, product innovation, project management and product marketing.
Here is a new customer's task: Build a CLI maze generator that outputs a maze as text characters (e.g., '#' for walls, ' ' for paths) to the console. Allow specifying maze dimensions..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

I agree with your suggestions. Let's discuss each of the product modalities in more detail:

1. CLI Maze Generator:
This product modality is a command-line interface (CLI) maze generator that outputs a maze as text characters (e.g., '#' for walls, ' ' for paths) to the console. This modality is suitable for users who prefer to work in the console and do not require a graphical user interface (GUI).

Pros:

* Easy to use and understand
* Can be used in any operating system
* Can be integrated with other CLI tools

Cons:

* Limited visualization capabilities
* May not be as visually appealing as a GUI maze generator
2. Text-based Maze:
This product modality is a text-based maze that can be generated and displayed in the console. This modality is suitable for users who prefer to work in the console and do not require a GUI.

Pros:

* Easy to use and understand
* Can be used in any operating system
* Can be integrated with other CLI tools

Cons:

* Limited visualization capabilities
* May not be as visually appealing as a GUI maze generator
3. Maze Game:
This product modality is a maze game that can be played in the console, with the maze generated using the CLI maze generator. This modality is suitable for users who prefer to work in the console and do not require a GUI.

Pros:

* Can be played in the console
* Can be integrated with other CLI tools
* Can be used in any operating system

Cons:

* Limited visualization capabilities
* May not be as visually appealing as a GUI maze generator

Based on the customer's needs and our expertise, we can evaluate each of these product modalities and determine which one is the best fit for the customer's requirements. Once we have reached a consensus, we can actively terminate the discussion by replying with "<INFO> CLI Maze Generator".

I understand the customer's needs and the existing product modalities. Based on the information provided, I suggest we discuss the following product modalities:

1. CLI Maze Generator: A command-line interface (CLI) maze generator that outputs a maze as text characters (e.g., '#' for walls, ' ' for paths) to the console.
2. Text-based Maze: A text-based maze that can be generated and displayed in the console.
3. Maze Game: A maze game that can be played in the console, with the maze generated using the CLI maze generator.
