# tkinter is included with Python but may need to be installed separately on some systems
# Note: argparse is part of the Python standard library and does not need to be listed

# tkinter is included with Python installations on Windows and macOS.
# On some Linux distributions, you might need to install it separately using the package manager.
# For example, on Ubuntu, you can use: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
