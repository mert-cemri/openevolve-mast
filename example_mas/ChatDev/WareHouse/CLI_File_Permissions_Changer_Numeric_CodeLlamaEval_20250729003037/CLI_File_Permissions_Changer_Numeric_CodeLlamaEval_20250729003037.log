Here is a conversation between two roles: Chief Executive Officer: ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.

Here is a new customer's task: Write a CLI utility to change file permissions using numeric (octal) notation (e.g., 755, 644) similar to `chmod`. The user provides the permission mode and file/directory path..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.

Chief Executive Officer: According to the new user's task and some creative brainstorm ideas listed below: 
Task: "Write a CLI utility to change file permissions using numeric (octal) notation (e.g., 755, 644) similar to `chmod`. The user provides the permission mode and file/directory path.".
Modality: "\\

Ideas: "".
We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 
As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).
Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  *. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

I understand the task and the requirements for the CLI utility. Here is a proposed design for the software:

1. `main.py`: This file will contain the main function that will be executed when the user runs the program. It will handle the user input, validate the input, and call the appropriate functions to change the file permissions.
2. `permissions.py`: This file will contain the functions that will be used to change the file permissions. It will have functions for changing the permissions of a single file, a directory, and a list of files.
3. `utils.py`: This file will contain utility functions that can be used throughout the program. It will have functions for validating user input, checking if a file or directory exists, and getting the current permissions of a file or directory.
4. `gui.py`: This file will contain the GUI code for the program. It will have functions for creating the GUI, displaying the current permissions of a file or directory, and allowing the user to enter the new permissions.

Here is an example of what the `main.py` file might look like:
```python
import permissions
import utils
import gui

def main():
    # Get the user input
    file_path = input("Enter the file or directory path: ")
    permissions = input("Enter the new permissions (e.g., 755, 644): ")

    # Validate the input
    if not utils.validate_file_path(file_path):
        print("Invalid file or directory path.")
        return
    if not utils.validate_permissions(permissions):
        print("Invalid permissions.")
        return

    # Change the file permissions
    permissions.change_permissions(file_path, permissions)

    # Display the current permissions
    print("Current permissions:", permissions.get_permissions(file_path))

    # Create the GUI
    gui.create_gui(file_path, permissions)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
And here is an example of what the `permissions.py` file might look like:
```python
import os

def change_permissions(file_path, permissions):
    # Check if the file or directory exists
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError("File or directory not found.")

    # Get the current permissions
    current_permissions = get_permissions(file_path)

    # Change the permissions
    os.chmod(file_path, permissions)

    # Return the new permissions
    return get_permissions(file_path)

def get_permissions(file_path):
    # Check if the file or directory exists
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError("File or directory not found.")

    # Get the current permissions
    return oct(os.stat(file_path).st_mode)[-3:]
```
And here is an example of what the `utils.py` file might look like:
```python
import os

def validate_file_path(file_path):
    # Check if the file or directory exists
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        return False

[2025-29-07 00:43:12 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 I understand the task and the requirements for the CLI utility. Here is a proposed design for the software:

1. `main.py`: This file will contain the main function that will be executed when the user runs the program. It will handle the user input, validate the input, and call the appropriate functions to change the file permissions.
2. `permissions.py`: This file will contain the functions that will be used to change the file permissions. It will have functions for changing the permissions of a single file, a directory, and a list of files.
3. `utils.py`: This file will contain utility functions that can be used throughout the program. It will have functions for validating user input, checking if a file or directory exists, and getting the current permissions of a file or directory.
4. `gui.py`: This file will contain the GUI code for the program. It will have functions for creating the GUI, displaying the current permissions of a file or directory, and allowing the user to enter the new permissions.

Here is an example of what the `main.py` file might look like:
```python
import permissions
import utils
import gui

def main():
    # Get the user input
    file_path = input("Enter the file or directory path: ")
    permissions = input("Enter the new permissions (e.g., 755, 644): ")

    # Validate the input
    if not utils.validate_file_path(file_path):
        print("Invalid file or directory path.")
        return
    if not utils.validate_permissions(permissions):
        print("Invalid permissions.")
        return

    # Change the file permissions
    permissions.change_permissions(file_path, permissions)

    # Display the current permissions
    print("Current permissions:", permissions.get_permissions(file_path))

    # Create the GUI
    gui.create_gui(file_path, permissions)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
And here is an example of what the `permissions.py` file might look like:
```python
import os

def change_permissions(file_path, permissions):
    # Check if the file or directory exists
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError("File or directory not found.")

    # Get the current permissions
    current_permissions = get_permissions(file_path)

    # Change the permissions
    os.chmod(file_path, permissions)

    # Return the new permissions
    return get_permissions(file_path)

def get_permissions(file_path):
    # Check if the file or directory exists
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError("File or directory not found.")

    # Get the current permissions
    return oct(os.stat(file_path).st_mode)[-3:]
```
And here is an example of what the `utils.py` file might look like:
```python
import os

def validate_file_path(file_path):
    # Check if the file or directory exists
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Write a CLI utility to change file permissions using numeric (octal) notation (e.g., 755, 644) similar to `chmod`. The user provides the permission mode and file/directory path..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

1. All referenced classes should be imported:

The code is missing the import statement for the `os` module, which is used in the `permissions.py` file.

Suggestion: Add the following import statement at the beginning of the `permissions.py` file: `import os`.

2. All methods should be implemented:

The `change_permissions` method in the `permissions.py` file is missing the implementation.

Suggestion: Implement the `change_permissions` method in the `permissions.py` file.

3. All methods need to have the necessary comments:

The `change_permissions` method in the `permissions.py` file is missing a docstring.

Suggestion: Add a docstring to the `change_permissions` method in the `permissions.py` file.

4. No potential bugs:

The `change_permissions` method in the `permissions.py` file has a potential bug. The `os.chmod` function is used to change the file permissions, but the `os.stat` function is used to get the current permissions. This could result in the file permissions being changed to the wrong value.

Suggestion: Use the `os.stat` function to get the current permissions and then use the `os.chmod` function to change the file permissions.

5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user:

The project does not conform to the tasks proposed by the user. The user asked for a CLI utility to change file permissions using numeric (octal) notation, but the project does not provide this functionality.

Suggestion: Implement the CLI utility to change file permissions using numeric (octal) notation.

6. Most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement:

The project does not provide a user-friendly interface for the user to interact with the generated software. The user needs to provide the file path and permissions as input, but the software does not provide any feedback on the success or failure of the operation.

Suggestion: Implement a user-friendly interface for the user to interact with the generated software.

Overall, the project needs to be improved in several areas, including the import statement for the `os` module, the implementation of the `change_permissions` method, the docstring for the `change_permissions` method, the potential bug in the `change_permissions` method, the implementation of the CLI utility, and the user-friendly interface.

Comments on Codes:
"1. All referenced classes should be imported:

The code is missing the import statement for the `os` module, which is used in the `permissions.py` file.

Suggestion: Add the following import statement at the beginning of the `permissions.py` file: `import os`.

2. All methods should be implemented:

The `change_permissions` method in the `permissions.py` file is missing the implementation.

Suggestion: Implement the `change_permissions` method in the `permissions.py` file.

3. All methods need to have the necessary comments:

The `change_permissions` method in the `permissions.py` file is missing a docstring.

Suggestion: Add a docstring to the `change_permissions` method in the `permissions.py` file.

4. No potential bugs:

The `change_permissions` method in the `permissions.py` file has a potential bug. The `os.chmod` function is used to change the file permissions, but the `os.stat` function is used to get the current permissions. This could result in the file permissions being changed to the wrong value.

Suggestion: Use the `os.stat` function to get the current permissions and then use the `os.chmod` function to change the file permissions.

5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user:

The project does not conform to the tasks proposed by the user. The user asked for a CLI utility to change file permissions using numeric (octal) notation, but the project does not provide this functionality.

Suggestion: Implement the CLI utility to change file permissions using numeric (octal) notation.

6. Most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement:

The project does not provide a user-friendly interface for the user to interact with the generated software. The user needs to provide the file path and permissions as input, but the software does not provide any feedback on the success or failure of the operation.

Suggestion: Implement a user-friendly interface for the user to interact with the generated software.

Overall, the project needs to be improved in several areas, including the import statement for the `os` module, the implementation of the `change_permissions` method, the docstring for the `change_permissions` method, the potential bug in the `change_permissions` method, the implementation of the CLI utility, and the user-friendly interface."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

1. All referenced classes should be imported:
The code is missing the import statements for the `os` module, which is used in the `permissions.py` file.

Suggestion: Add the following import statement at the top of the `permissions.py` file: `import os`.

2. All methods should be implemented:
The `change_permissions` method in the `permissions.py` file is not implemented.

Suggestion: Implement the `change_permissions` method in the `permissions.py` file.

3. All methods need to have the necessary comments:
The `change_permissions` method in the `permissions.py` file is missing a docstring.

Suggestion: Add a docstring to the `change_permissions` method in the `permissions.py` file.

4. No potential bugs:
The code is missing error handling for the `change_permissions` method in the `permissions.py` file.

Suggestion: Add error handling to the `change_permissions` method in the `permissions.py` file.

5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user:
The code is missing the functionality to change the file permissions using numeric (octal) notation.

Suggestion: Implement the functionality to change the file permissions using numeric (octal) notation in the `permissions.py` file.

6. Most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement:
The code is missing the functionality to display the current file permissions.

Suggestion: Implement the functionality to display the current file permissions in the `permissions.py` file.

Overall, the code is missing several important features and needs to be improved. The suggestions above should be implemented to make the software directly operable without further coding.

Comments on Codes:
"1. All referenced classes should be imported:
The code is missing the import statements for the `os` module, which is used in the `permissions.py` file.

Suggestion: Add the following import statement at the top of the `permissions.py` file: `import os`.

2. All methods should be implemented:
The `change_permissions` method in the `permissions.py` file is not implemented.

Suggestion: Implement the `change_permissions` method in the `permissions.py` file.

3. All methods need to have the necessary comments:
The `change_permissions` method in the `permissions.py` file is missing a docstring.

Suggestion: Add a docstring to the `change_permissions` method in the `permissions.py` file.

4. No potential bugs:
The code is missing error handling for the `change_permissions` method in the `permissions.py` file.

Suggestion: Add error handling to the `change_permissions` method in the `permissions.py` file.

5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user:
The code is missing the functionality to change the file permissions using numeric (octal) notation.

Suggestion: Implement the functionality to change the file permissions using numeric (octal) notation in the `permissions.py` file.

6. Most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement:
The code is missing the functionality to display the current file permissions.

Suggestion: Implement the functionality to display the current file permissions in the `permissions.py` file.

Overall, the code is missing several important features and needs to be improved. The suggestions above should be implemented to make the software directly operable without further coding."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
