Language:
 1. **Performance**: The task is I/O bound, meaning the performance of the CPU is not a critical factor. Python's performance is sufficient for this use case.
2. **System Compatibility**: Python is widely available and easy to install on most systems, making it a good choice for cross-platform compatibility.
3. **Specific Requirements**: Python's `subprocess` module can be used to tail the log file, and its `re` module can be used for regular expression matching to highlight keywords. These capabilities make Python a suitable choice.
4. **Ease of Use and Learning Curve**: Python's simplicity and readability make it a great choice for rapid development and maintenance.

Given these points, Python is indeed a strong candidate for this task. It balances performance, compatibility, specific requirements, and ease of use.
