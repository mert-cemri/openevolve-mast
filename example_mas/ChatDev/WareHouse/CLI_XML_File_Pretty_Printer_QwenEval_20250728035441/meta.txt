Language:
 Given the requirements of the task, which is to develop a CLI XML file pretty printer, Python is indeed a great choice due to its simplicity, readability, and the availability of libraries that make handling XML straightforward. The `xml.dom.minidom` module, for example, provides a simple way to parse and pretty-print XML documents. Additionally, Python's extensive standard library and third-party packages like `lxml` offer robust solutions for XML processing.

Given these considerations, I propose Python as the programming language for developing the CLI XML file pretty printer.
