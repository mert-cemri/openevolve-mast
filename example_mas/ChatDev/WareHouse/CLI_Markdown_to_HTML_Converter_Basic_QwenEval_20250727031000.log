Given the customer's request for a basic CLI Markdown to HTML converter, we need to consider the modality that best fits this requirement. The product should be a tool that can be used via command line to convert Markdown files to HTML files.

Looking at the list of product modalities ChatDev has created before, the most relevant one seems to be "Application." This is because the Markdown to HTML converter is a tool or software application that can be implemented via Python, as mentioned in the description of the "Application" modality.

Therefore, I propose we choose the "Application" modality for this product.

The customer's request is for a basic CLI (Command Line Interface) tool that converts Markdown files to HTML. This is indeed a tool or application that can be implemented via Python, as you mentioned. However, let's consider the other modalities to ensure we're making the best decision.

1. **Document**: This modality is about creating .docx files. While we could create a document explaining how to use a Markdown to HTML converter, it doesn't directly fulfill the requirement of building the converter itself.

2. **PowerPoint**: This is for creating .pptx files, which is more about presenting information visually. Again, this doesn't align with the requirement of building a CLI tool.

3. **Excel**: This is for creating .xlsx files, which is more about data manipulation and analysis. This modality is not suitable for building a CLI tool.

4. **PDF**: This is for creating .pdf files, which is also about presenting information. It doesn't align with the requirement of building a CLI tool.

5. **Website**: This is for creating .html files, but the requirement is to build a tool that converts Markdown to HTML, not to create a website itself.

6. **Application**: This modality is about implementing visualized games, software, or tools via Python. This aligns perfectly with the requirement of building a CLI Markdown to HTML converter.

7. **Dashboard**: This is for displaying a panel visualizing real-time information. This doesn't align with the requirement of building a CLI tool.

8. **Mind Map**: This is for representing ideas with related concepts arranged around a core concept. This doesn't align with the requirement of building a CLI tool.

Given this analysis, the "Application" modality is indeed the best fit for the customer's request.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The customer's request is to build a basic CLI Markdown to HTML converter. The goal is to create a command-line interface tool that can convert Markdown files to HTML files. Given the modalities provided, the most appropriate choice is clearly the "Application" modality, as it is specifically designed for creating software applications and tools.

Here is the detailed reasoning:

1. **Document**: This modality is for creating documents in .docx format, which is not suitable for building a command-line tool.
2. **PowerPoint**: This modality is for creating presentations in .pptx format, which is not suitable for building a command-line tool.
3. **Excel**: This modality is for creating spreadsheets in .xlsx format, which is not suitable for building a command-line tool.
4. **PDF**: This modality is for creating PDF documents, which is not suitable for building a command-line tool.
5. **Website**: This modality is for creating websites, which is not suitable for building a command-line tool.
6. **Application**: This modality is for creating software applications and tools, which is suitable for building a command-line tool.
7. **Dashboard**: This modality is for creating dashboards, which is not suitable for building a command-line tool.
8. **Mind Map**: This modality is for creating mind maps, which is not suitable for building a command-line tool.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate modality for building a CLI Markdown to HTML converter is clearly the "Application" modality.

This is because the Markdown to HTML converter is a tool or software application that can be implemented via Python, as mentioned in the description of the "Application" modality.\nTherefore, I propose we choose the "Application" modality for this product.\n Application\n\nChief Executive Officer: The customer\'s request is for a basic CLI (Command Line Interface) tool that converts Markdown files to HTML. This is indeed a tool or application that can be implemented via Python, as you mentioned. However, let\'s consider the other modalities to ensure we\'re making the best decision.\n1. Document: This modality is about creating .docx files. While we could create a document explaining how to use a Markdown to HTML converter, it doesn\'t directly fulfill the requirement of building the converter itself.\n2. PowerPoint: This is for creating .pptx files, which is more about presenting information visually. Again, this doesn\'t align with the requirement of building a CLI tool.\n3. Excel: This is for creating .xlsx files, which is more about data manipulation and analysis. This modality is not suitable for building a CLI tool.\n4. PDF: This is for creating .pdf files, which is also about presenting information. It doesn\'t align with the requirement of building a CLI tool.\n5. Website: This is for creating .html files, but the requirement is to build a tool that converts Markdown to HTML, not to create a website itself.\n6. Application: This modality is about implementing visualized games, software, or tools via Python. This aligns perfectly with the requirement of building a CLI Markdown to HTML converter.\n7. Dashboard: This is for displaying a panel visualizing real-time information. This doesn\'t align with the requirement of building a CLI tool.\n8. Mind Map: This is for representing ideas with related concepts arranged around a core concept. This doesn\'t align with the requirement of building a CLI tool.\nGiven this analysis, the "Application" modality is indeed the best fit for the customer\'s request.\n Application\n\nChief Executive Officer: The customer\'s request is for a basic CLI (Command Line Interface) tool that converts Markdown files to HTML.

Here is a conversation between two roles: Chief Executive Officer: ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.

Chief Executive Officer: ChatDev has made products in the following form before:
Image: can present information in line chart, bar chart, flow chart, cloud chart, Gantt chart, etc.
Document: can present information via .docx files.
PowerPoint: can present information via .pptx files.
Excel: can present information via .xlsx files.
PDF: can present information via .pdf files.
Website: can present personal resume, tutorial, products, or ideas, via .html files.
Application: can implement visualized game, software, tool, etc, via python.
Dashboard: can display a panel visualizing real-time information.
Mind Map: can represent ideas, with related concepts arranged around a core concept.
As the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?
Note that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> PowerPoint".

Chief Product Officer: Given the customer's request for a basic CLI Markdown to HTML converter, we need to consider the modality that best fits this requirement. The product should be a tool that can be used via command line to convert Markdown files to HTML files.
Looking at the list of product modalities ChatDev has created before, the most relevant one seems to be "Application." This is because the Markdown to HTML converter is a tool or software application that can be implemented via Python, as mentioned in the description of the "Application" modality.
Therefore, I propose we choose the "Application" modality for this product.
<INFO> Application

Chief Executive Officer: The customer's request is for a basic CLI (Command Line Interface) tool that converts Markdown files to HTML. This is indeed a tool or application that can be implemented via Python, as you mentioned. However, let's consider the other modalities to ensure we're making the best decision.
1. **Document**: This modality is about creating .docx files. While we could create a document explaining how to use a Markdown to HTML converter, it doesn't directly fulfill the requirement of building the converter itself.
2. **PowerPoint**: This is for creating .pptx files, which is more about presenting information visually. Again, this doesn't align with the requirement of building a CLI tool.
3. **Excel**: This is for creating .xlsx files, which is more about data manipulation and analysis. This modality is not suitable for building a CLI tool.
4. **PDF**: This is for creating .pdf files, which is also about presenting information. It doesn't align with the requirement of building a CLI tool.
5. **Website**: This is for creating .html files, but the requirement is to build a tool that converts Markdown to HTML, not to create a website itself.
6. **Application**: This modality is about implementing visualized games, software, or tools via Python. This aligns perfectly with the requirement of building a CLI Markdown to HTML converter.
7. **Dashboard**: This is for displaying a panel visualizing real-time information. This doesn't align with the requirement of building a CLI tool.
8. **Mind Map**: This is for representing ideas with related concepts arranged around a core concept. This doesn't align with the requirement of building a CLI tool.
Given this analysis, the "Application" modality is indeed the best fit for the customer's request.

<INFO> Application

Chief Executive Officer: The customer's request is to build a basic CLI Markdown to HTML converter. The goal is to create a command-line interface tool that can convert Markdown files to HTML files. Given the modalities provided, the most appropriate choice is clearly the "Application" modality, as it is specifically designed for creating software applications and tools.
Here is the detailed reasoning:
1. **Document**: This modality is for creating documents in .docx format, which is not suitable for building a command-line tool.
2. **PowerPoint**: This modality is for creating presentations in .pptx format, which is not suitable for building a command-line tool.
3. **Excel**: This modality is for creating spreadsheets in .xlsx format, which is not suitable for building a command-line tool.
4. **PDF**: This modality is for creating PDF documents, which is not suitable for building a command-line tool.
5. **Website**: This modality is for creating websites, which is not suitable for building a command-line tool.
6. **Application**: This modality is for creating software applications and tools, which is suitable for building a command-line tool.
7. **Dashboard**: This modality is for creating dashboards, which is not suitable for building a command-line tool.
8. **Mind Map**: This modality is for creating mind maps, which is not suitable for building a command-line tool.
Given this analysis, the most appropriate modality for building a CLI Markdown to HTML converter is clearly the "Application" modality.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Build a basic CLI Markdown to HTML converter. It should support common Markdown syntax like headers, bold, italics, lists, and links, converting a .md file to a .html file..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Markdown to HTML conversion is a text processing task that involves parsing and transforming text according to specific rules. Python is well-suited for such tasks due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive library support. Python has libraries like `markdown` and `mistune` that can handle Markdown parsing and conversion to HTML efficiently. Additionally, Python's command-line interface (CLI) capabilities make it easy to create a CLI tool for this purpose.

Considering these factors, I propose Python as the programming language for this task.

Markdown to HTML conversion indeed involves parsing and transforming text, and Python is a strong candidate due to its simplicity, readability, and the availability of libraries such as `markdown` and `mistune`. These libraries can handle the parsing and conversion efficiently. Furthermore, Python's CLI capabilities make it straightforward to create a CLI tool for this purpose.

However, I would also consider other languages that might be equally suitable. For instance, JavaScript (Node.js) is another powerful language for text processing and has libraries like `marked` for Markdown conversion. It also has strong CLI capabilities with tools like `commander` or `yargs`.

Given the simplicity and the extensive library support in Python, it seems like a solid choice. However, I would like to hear your thoughts on this before concluding.

1. **Simplicity and Readability**: Python is renowned for its simplicity and readability, which makes it an excellent choice for rapid development and maintenance.
2. **Library Support**: Python has robust libraries like `markdown` and `mistune` that can handle Markdown parsing and conversion to HTML efficiently.
3. **CLI Capabilities**: Python's CLI capabilities are strong, and creating a CLI tool is straightforward with libraries like `argparse` or `click`.

On the other hand, JavaScript (Node.js) is also a strong candidate:
1. **Simplicity and Readability**: JavaScript is also known for its simplicity and readability, especially with modern syntax.
2. **Library Support**: JavaScript has libraries like `marked` and `markdown-it` that can handle Markdown parsing and conversion to HTML efficiently.
3. **CLI Capabilities**: JavaScript has strong CLI capabilities with tools like `commander` or `yargs`.

However, considering the simplicity, readability, and extensive library support, Python remains a solid choice for this task.

Python is well-suited for such tasks due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive library support. Python has libraries like markdown and mistune that can handle Markdown parsing and conversion to HTML efficiently. Additionally, Python\'s command-line interface (CLI) capabilities make it easy to create a CLI tool for this purpose.\nConsidering these factors, I propose Python as the programming language for this task.\n Python\n\nChief Executive Officer: Markdown to HTML conversion indeed involves parsing and transforming text, and Python is a strong candidate due to its simplicity, readability, and the availability of libraries such as markdown and mistune. These libraries can handle the parsing and conversion efficiently. Furthermore, Python\'s CLI capabilities make it straightforward to create a CLI tool for this purpose.\nHowever, I would also consider other languages that might be equally suitable. For instance, JavaScript (Node.js) is another powerful language for text processing and has libraries like marked for Markdown conversion. It also has strong CLI capabilities with tools like commander or yargs.\nGiven the simplicity and the extensive library support in Python, it seems like a solid choice.

Ideas: "".
We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 
As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).
Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

Chief Technology Officer: Markdown to HTML conversion is a text processing task that involves parsing and transforming text according to specific rules. Python is well-suited for such tasks due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive library support. Python has libraries like `markdown` and `mistune` that can handle Markdown parsing and conversion to HTML efficiently. Additionally, Python's command-line interface (CLI) capabilities make it easy to create a CLI tool for this purpose.
Considering these factors, I propose Python as the programming language for this task.
<INFO> Python

Chief Executive Officer: Markdown to HTML conversion indeed involves parsing and transforming text, and Python is a strong candidate due to its simplicity, readability, and the availability of libraries such as `markdown` and `mistune`. These libraries can handle the parsing and conversion efficiently. Furthermore, Python's CLI capabilities make it straightforward to create a CLI tool for this purpose.
However, I would also consider other languages that might be equally suitable. For instance, JavaScript (Node.js) is another powerful language for text processing and has libraries like `marked` for Markdown conversion. It also has strong CLI capabilities with tools like `commander` or `yargs`.
Given the simplicity and the extensive library support in Python, it seems like a solid choice. However, I would like to hear your thoughts on this before concluding.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).
