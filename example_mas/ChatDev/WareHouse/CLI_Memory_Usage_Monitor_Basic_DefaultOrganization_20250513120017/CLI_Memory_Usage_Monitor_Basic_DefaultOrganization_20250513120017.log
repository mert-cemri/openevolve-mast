Given the task of creating a CLI memory usage monitor, the most suitable product modality would be an Application. This is because the task involves developing a tool that can interact with system files and display real-time information, which aligns well with the capabilities of an Application. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. An Application is indeed the most appropriate product modality for a CLI memory usage monitor. It allows us to create a tool that can effectively interact with system files and provide real-time monitoring of memory usage, which is exactly what the customer has requested.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a CLI memory usage monitor that displays overall system memory usage and optionally lists top memory-consuming processes. (e.g. using /proc/meminfo and /proc/[pid]/status)..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Create a CLI memory usage monitor that displays overall system memory usage and optionally lists top memory-consuming processes. (e.g. using /proc/meminfo and /proc/[pid]/status).".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To create a CLI memory usage monitor with an optional GUI, we'll structure the application into several components. We'll use Python for the implementation and Tkinter for the GUI. The application will have the following core components:

1. **MemoryMonitor**: A class responsible for fetching and processing memory data from `/proc/meminfo` and `/proc/[pid]/status`.
   - `get_memory_info()`: Fetches overall system memory usage.
   - `get_top_processes()`: Lists top memory-consuming processes.

2. **CLI**: A function to handle command-line interface interactions.
   - `run_cli()`: Executes the CLI version of the memory monitor.

3. **GUI**: A class to create a graphical user interface using Tkinter.
   - `create_gui()`: Sets up the GUI components and displays memory information.

4. **main**: The entry point of the application that decides whether to run the CLI or GUI based on user input.

Let's start with the implementation:

### main.py

```python
'''

Main entry point for the memory usage monitor application. Decides whether to run the CLI or GUI version.

'''

import sys
from memory_monitor import MemoryMonitor
from cli import run_cli
from gui import create_gui

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) > 1 and sys.argv[1] == '--cli':
        run_cli()
    else:
        create_gui()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### memory_monitor.py

```python
'''

Handles fetching and processing of memory data from the system.

'''

import os

class MemoryMonitor:
    def get_memory_info(self):
        '''Fetches overall system memory usage.'''
        with open('/proc/meminfo', 'r') as file:
            meminfo = file.readlines()
        memory_data = {}
        for line in meminfo:
            parts = line.split(':')
            memory_data[parts[0]] = parts[1].strip()
        return memory_data

    def get_top_processes(self, limit=5):
        '''Lists top memory-consuming processes.'''
        processes = []
        for pid in os.listdir('/proc'):
            if pid.isdigit():
                try:
                    with open(f'/proc/{pid}/status', 'r') as file:
                        status_info = file.readlines()
                    process_info = {line.split(':')[0]: line.split(':')[1].strip() for line in status_info}
                    processes.append((process_info['Name'], int(process_info['VmRSS'].split()[0])))
                except (FileNotFoundError, KeyError):
                    continue
        processes.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        return processes[:limit]
```

### cli.py

```python
'''

Handles the command-line interface for the memory usage monitor.

'''

from memory_monitor import MemoryMonitor

def run_cli():
    '''Executes the CLI version of the memory monitor.'''
    monitor = MemoryMonitor()
    memory_info = monitor.get_memory_info()
    print("Overall Memory Usage:")
    for key, value in memory_info.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")
    
    print("\nTop Memory-Consuming Processes:")
    top_processes = monitor.get_top_processes()
    for name, memory in top_processes:
        print(f"{name}: {memory} KB")
```

### gui.py

```python
'''

Creates a graphical user interface for the memory usage monitor using Tkinter.

'''

import tkinter as tk
from memory_monitor import MemoryMonitor

def create_gui():
    '''Sets up the GUI components and displays memory information.'''
    monitor = MemoryMonitor()
    memory_info = monitor.get_memory_info()
    top_processes = monitor.get_top_processes()

    root = tk.Tk()
    root.title("Memory Usage Monitor")

    memory_frame = tk.Frame(root)
    memory_frame.pack(pady=10)

    tk.Label(memory_frame, text="Overall Memory Usage:").pack()
    for key, value in memory_info.items():
        tk.Label(memory_frame, text=f"{key}: {value}").pack()

    process_frame = tk.Frame(root)
    process_frame.pack(pady=10)

    tk.Label(process_frame, text="Top Memory-Consuming Processes:").pack()
    for name, memory in top_processes:
        tk.Label(process_frame, text=f"{name}: {memory} KB").pack()

    root.mainloop()
```

This setup provides both a CLI and a GUI for monitoring memory usage, allowing users to choose their preferred interface. The `MemoryMonitor` class handles the core functionality of fetching and processing memory data, while the CLI and GUI components provide different ways to interact with this data.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a CLI memory usage monitor that displays overall system memory usage and optionally lists top memory-consuming processes. (e.g. using /proc/meminfo and /proc/[pid]/status)..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code is generally well-structured and meets the requirements of the task. However, there is a potential issue with the `get_top_processes` method in `memory_monitor.py`. The method assumes that the `VmRSS` field is always present in the `/proc/[pid]/status` file, which might not be the case for all processes. This could lead to a `KeyError` if the field is missing. 

To fix this, you should add a check to ensure that `VmRSS` is present in the `process_info` dictionary before attempting to access it. Here's how you can modify the code:

```python
def get_top_processes(self, limit=5):
    '''Lists top memory-consuming processes.'''
    processes = []
    for pid in os.listdir('/proc'):
        if pid.isdigit():
            try:
                with open(f'/proc/{pid}/status', 'r') as file:
                    status_info = file.readlines()
                process_info = {line.split(':')[0]: line.split(':')[1].strip() for line in status_info}
                if 'VmRSS' in process_info:
                    processes.append((process_info['Name'], int(process_info['VmRSS'].split()[0])))
            except (FileNotFoundError, KeyError):
                continue
    processes.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return processes[:limit]
```

This change ensures that the code will not raise a `KeyError` if `VmRSS` is missing, thus making the application more robust.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is generally well-structured and meets the requirements of the task. However, there is a potential issue with the `get_top_processes` method in `memory_monitor.py`. The method assumes that the `VmRSS` field is always present in the `/proc/[pid]/status` file, which might not be the case for all processes. This could lead to a `KeyError` if the field is missing. 

To fix this, you should add a check to ensure that `VmRSS` is present in the `process_info` dictionary before attempting to access it. Here's how you can modify the code:

```python
def get_top_processes(self, limit=5):
    '''Lists top memory-consuming processes.'''
    processes = []
    for pid in os.listdir('/proc'):
        if pid.isdigit():
            try:
                with open(f'/proc/{pid}/status', 'r') as file:
                    status_info = file.readlines()
                process_info = {line.split(':')[0]: line.split(':')[1].strip() for line in status_info}
                if 'VmRSS' in process_info:
                    processes.append((process_info['Name'], int(process_info['VmRSS'].split()[0])))
            except (FileNotFoundError, KeyError):
                continue
    processes.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return processes[:limit]
```

This change ensures that the code will not raise a `KeyError` if `VmRSS` is missing, thus making the application more robust."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

The method assumes that the VmRSS field is always present in the /proc/[pid]/status file, which might not be the case for all processes. This could lead to a KeyError if the field is missing. \n\nTo fix this, you should add a check to ensure that VmRSS is present in the process_info dictionary before attempting to access it. Here's how you can modify the code:\n\npython\ndef get_top_processes(self, limit=5):\n    '''Lists top memory-consuming processes.'''\n    processes = []\n    for pid in os.listdir('/proc'):\n        if pid.isdigit():\n            try:\n                with open(f'/proc/{pid}/status', 'r') as file:\n                    status_info = file.readlines()\n                process_info = {line.split(':')[0]: line.split(':')[1].strip() for line in status_info}\n                if 'VmRSS' in process_info:\n                    processes.append((process_info['Name'], int(process_info['VmRSS'].split()[0])))\n            except (FileNotFoundError, KeyError):\n                continue\n    processes.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n    return processes[:limit]\n\n\nThis change ensures that the code will not raise a KeyError if VmRSS is missing, thus making the application more robust."} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Here is a new customer's task: Create a CLI memory usage monitor that displays overall system memory usage and optionally lists top memory-consuming processes. (e.g. using /proc/meminfo and /proc/[pid]/status)..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code is generally well-structured and meets most of the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the `get_top_processes` method in `memory_monitor.py`. The method currently assumes that all processes have a `VmRSS` entry in their `/proc/[pid]/status` file, which may not always be the case. This could lead to a `KeyError` if the entry is missing. Additionally, the method should handle the case where the `VmRSS` value is not in the expected format.

### Suggested Revision:
1. Update the `get_top_processes` method to handle cases where the `VmRSS` entry is missing or not in the expected format.

```python
def get_top_processes(self, limit=5):
    '''Lists top memory-consuming processes.'''
    processes = []
    for pid in os.listdir('/proc'):
        if pid.isdigit():
            try:
                with open(f'/proc/{pid}/status', 'r') as file:
                    status_info = file.readlines()
                process_info = {line.split(':')[0]: line.split(':')[1].strip() for line in status_info}
                if 'VmRSS' in process_info:
                    try:
                        memory_usage = int(process_info['VmRSS'].split()[0])
                        processes.append((process_info['Name'], memory_usage))
                    except (ValueError, IndexError):
                        continue
            except (FileNotFoundError, KeyError):
                continue
    processes.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return processes[:limit]
```

This revision ensures that the method is more robust and handles unexpected data formats gracefully, preventing potential runtime errors.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is generally well-structured and meets most of the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the `get_top_processes` method in `memory_monitor.py`. The method currently assumes that all processes have a `VmRSS` entry in their `/proc/[pid]/status` file, which may not always be the case. This could lead to a `KeyError` if the entry is missing. Additionally, the method should handle the case where the `VmRSS` value is not in the expected format.

### Suggested Revision:
1. Update the `get_top_processes` method to handle cases where the `VmRSS` entry is missing or not in the expected format.

```python
def get_top_processes(self, limit=5):
    '''Lists top memory-consuming processes.'''
    processes = []
    for pid in os.listdir('/proc'):
        if pid.isdigit():
            try:
                with open(f'/proc/{pid}/status', 'r') as file:
                    status_info = file.readlines()
                process_info = {line.split(':')[0]: line.split(':')[1].strip() for line in status_info}
                if 'VmRSS' in process_info:
                    try:
                        memory_usage = int(process_info['VmRSS'].split()[0])
                        processes.append((process_info['Name'], memory_usage))
                    except (ValueError, IndexError):
                        continue
            except (FileNotFoundError, KeyError):
                continue
    processes.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return processes[:limit]
```

This revision ensures that the method is more robust and handles unexpected data formats gracefully, preventing potential runtime errors."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a CLI memory usage monitor that displays overall system memory usage and optionally lists top memory-consuming processes. (e.g. using /proc/meminfo and /proc/[pid]/status)..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error traceback provided indicates an issue when attempting to run the graphical user interface (GUI) version of the memory usage monitor application. The specific error is:

```
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error occurs because the Tkinter library, which is used to create the GUI, requires a display environment to render the graphical interface. The error message suggests that the application is being run in an environment where a display is not available or not properly configured. This is common when running GUI applications on a headless server or in environments without a graphical display, such as a remote terminal session without X11 forwarding.

**Summary of the Bug:**
1. **Environment Issue:** The error is not due to a bug in the code itself but rather an issue with the environment where the code is being executed. The environment lacks a graphical display or the necessary configuration to support GUI applications.
   
2. **Tkinter Dependency:** Tkinter requires a display server to render the GUI. Without a display server, the application cannot create a window, leading to the `TclError`.

**Potential Solutions:**
- **Run in a GUI-Enabled Environment:** Ensure that the application is run on a system with a graphical user interface and a properly configured display server.
- **Use X11 Forwarding:** If running on a remote server, use X11 forwarding to enable GUI applications to display on your local machine. This can be done by connecting to the server using SSH with the `-X` or `-Y` option.
- **Use a Virtual Display:** Set up a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to simulate a display environment for GUI applications on headless servers.

By addressing the environment configuration, the GUI version of the application should be able to run without encountering the `TclError`.

- **Use X11 Forwarding:** If running on a remote server, use X11 forwarding to enable GUI applications to display on your local machine. This can be done by connecting to the server using SSH with the `-X` or `-Y` option.
- **Use a Virtual Display:** Set up a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to simulate a display environment for GUI applications on headless servers.

By addressing the environment configuration, the GUI version of the application should be able to run without encountering the `TclError`."
Note that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary. Now, use the format exemplified above and modify the problematic codes based on the error summary. Output the codes that you fixed based on the test reported and corresponding explanations (strictly follow the format defined above, including FILENAME, LANGUAGE, DOCSTRING and CODE; incomplete "TODO" codes are strictly prohibited). If no bugs are reported, please return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a CLI memory usage monitor that displays overall system memory usage and optionally lists top memory-consuming processes. (e.g. using /proc/meminfo and /proc/[pid]/status)..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

def create_gui():
    '''Sets up the GUI components and displays memory information.'''
    try:
        root = tk.Tk()
        root.title("Memory Usage Monitor")
        monitor = MemoryMonitor()
        memory_info = monitor.get_memory_info()

Explanation:
- Added a try-except block around the Tkinter GUI creation code to catch `tk.TclError`.
- If the error occurs, a user-friendly message is printed to inform the user about the environment issue, suggesting that the application should be run in a GUI-enabled environment.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a CLI memory usage monitor that displays overall system memory usage and optionally lists top memory-consuming processes. (e.g. using /proc/meminfo and /proc/[pid]/status)..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code, the project primarily uses the standard Python library and the Tkinter module for creating the GUI. Tkinter is included with Python, so it doesn't need to be listed in the `requirements.txt` file. However, if there were any additional packages used, they would need to be specified. Since no external packages are used in the provided code, the `requirements.txt` file will be minimal:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

If you plan to expand the project in the future or use any additional libraries, you can update the `requirements.txt` file accordingly.

However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# Memory Usage Monitor

A simple and efficient CLI and GUI application to monitor system memory usage and identify top memory-consuming processes.

## Overview

The Memory Usage Monitor is a Python-based application designed to provide users with insights into their system's memory usage. It offers both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI) to cater to different user preferences. The application fetches data from the `/proc/meminfo` and `/proc/[pid]/status` files to display overall memory usage and list the top memory-consuming processes.

## Features

- **Overall Memory Usage**: Displays detailed information about the system's memory usage.
- **Top Memory-Consuming Processes**: Lists the processes consuming the most memory, helping users identify potential resource hogs.
- **Dual Interface**: Offers both CLI and GUI options for flexibility in usage.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- No external dependencies are required for this project.

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd memory-usage-monitor
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   - For the CLI version:
     ```bash
     python main.py --cli
     ```
   - For the GUI version:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

To use the CLI version, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py --cli
```

This will display the overall memory usage and list the top memory-consuming processes directly in your terminal.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

To use the GUI version, simply run:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will open a window displaying the overall memory usage and the top memory-consuming processes in a user-friendly interface.

## Troubleshooting

- **GUI Errors**: If you encounter errors while launching the GUI, ensure that you are running the application in a GUI-enabled environment. The application uses Tkinter, which requires a graphical interface to function properly.

## Documentation

For further details and updates, please refer to the project's documentation or contact support.
