As the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?
Note that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> PowerPoint".

Chief Product Officer: The task is to create a CLI script creator for simple backups. This involves generating a script that users can run in their command line interface to back up specified directories to a target location. Given the options provided, we need to choose the most suitable modality for this task.
1. **Image**: This is not suitable as the task involves creating a script, not visualizing data.
2. **Document**: While a document could describe how to create the script, it doesn't actually create the script.
3. **PowerPoint**: Similar to a document, a PowerPoint presentation could describe the process but not create the script.
4. **Excel**: This is not suitable for creating a script.
5. **PDF**: Similar to a document, a PDF could describe the process but not create the script.
6. **Website**: A website could host the script and provide instructions, but it doesn't generate the script dynamically.
7. **Application**: This is the most suitable option as it can implement a tool that generates the script based on user input.
8. **Dashboard**: This is not suitable as it is used for displaying real-time information, not for creating scripts.
9. **Mind Map**: This is not suitable as it is used for representing ideas, not for creating scripts.
Given these considerations, the most appropriate product modality for this task is an **Application**.

You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: Write a CLI script creator for simple backups. User specifies source directories and a target backup location. The script (e.g., shell script using `rsync` or `tar`) is generated..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Ideas: "".

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Write a CLI script creator for simple backups. User specifies source directories and a target backup location. The script (e.g., shell script using `rsync` or `tar`) is generated..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

The task involves creating a CLI script generator for simple backups using `rsync` or `tar`. This task is relatively straightforward and involves string manipulation, file system operations, and command-line interface creation. 

Python is a great choice for this task because:
- It has a rich standard library that supports file operations and command-line interface creation.
- It has a simple and readable syntax, making the script easy to write and maintain.
- It has a large community and extensive documentation, which can be helpful if we encounter any issues.
- Python can easily generate shell scripts, which can then be executed to perform the backup operations.

Given these points, I propose Python as the programming language for this task.

While Python is indeed a great choice for this task due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive libraries, we should also consider the context of the task. The task specifically involves generating shell scripts that use `rsync` or `tar` for backup operations. These are Unix/Linux commands, and using a shell scripting language like Bash might be more intuitive for this specific use case.

However, given the requirement to generate these scripts programmatically and the benefits of Python mentioned by you, I agree that Python is a suitable choice. It can easily handle string manipulation, file system operations, and command-line interface creation, and it can generate shell scripts that use `rsync` or `tar`.

Therefore, I concur with your proposal.

The task is to create a CLI script generator for simple backups using `rsync` or `tar`. While Bash is indeed the native language for shell scripting and directly interacts with Unix/Linux commands, Python offers several advantages in this context:

1. **Readability and Maintainability**: Python's syntax is clean and easy to understand, which makes the code more maintainable, especially if the script generator needs to be extended in the future.
2. **Cross-Platform**: Python is cross-platform, which means the script generator can be run on different operating systems without modification.
3. **Libraries and Ecosystem**: Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries that can handle file operations, command-line interface creation, and even system calls, making the task more efficient.
4. **Community and Support**: Python has a large community and extensive documentation, which can be very helpful for troubleshooting and learning.

Given these points, Python is a suitable choice for this task. It can easily generate shell scripts that use `rsync` or `tar` for backup operations.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Write a CLI script creator for simple backups. User specifies source directories and a target backup location. The script (e.g., shell script using `rsync` or `tar`) is generated..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

While Bash is indeed the native language for shell scripting and directly interacts with Unix/Linux commands, Python offers several advantages in this context:

1. **Readability and Maintainability**: Python's syntax is clean and easy to understand, which makes the code more maintainable, especially if the script generator needs to be extended in the future.
2. **Cross-Platform**: Python is cross-platform, which means the script generator can be run on different operating systems without modification.
3. **Libraries and Ecosystem**: Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries that can handle file operations, command-line interface creation, and even system calls, making the task more efficient.
4. **Community and Support**: Python has a large community and extensive documentation, which can be very helpful for troubleshooting and learning.

Given these points, Python is a suitable choice for this task. It can easily generate shell scripts that use `rsync` or `tar` for backup operations.

demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).\nNote that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: " " where "" represents a programming language.\n\nChief Technology Officer: The task involves creating a CLI script generator for simple backups using rsync or tar. This task is relatively straightforward and involves string manipulation, file system operations, and command-line interface creation. \nPython is a great choice for this task because:\n- It has a rich standard library that supports file operations and command-line interface creation.\n- It has a simple and readable syntax, making the script easy to write and maintain.\n- It has a large community and extensive documentation, which can be helpful if we encounter any issues.\n- Python can easily generate shell scripts, which can then be executed to perform the backup operations.\nGiven these points, I propose Python as the programming language for this task.\n Python\n\nChief Executive Officer: While Python is indeed a great choice for this task due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive libraries, we should also consider the context of the task. The task specifically involves generating shell scripts that use rsync or tar for backup operations. These are Unix/Linux commands, and using a shell scripting language like Bash might be more intuitive for this specific use case.\nHowever, given the requirement to generate these scripts programmatically and the benefits of Python mentioned by you, I agree that Python is a suitable choice. It can easily handle string manipulation, file system operations, and command-line interface creation, and it can generate shell scripts that use rsync or tar.\nTherefore, I concur with your proposal.\n Python\n\nChief Executive Officer: While Python is indeed a great choice for this task due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive libraries, we should also consider the context of the task.

While Bash is indeed the native language for shell scripting and directly interacts with Unix/Linux commands, Python offers several advantages in this context:\n1. Readability and Maintainability: Python\'s syntax is clean and easy to understand, which makes the code more maintainable, especially if the script generator needs to be extended in the future.\n2. Cross-Platform: Python is cross-platform, which means the script generator can be run on different operating systems without modification.\n3. Libraries and Ecosystem: Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries that can handle file operations, command-line interface creation, and even system calls, making the task more efficient.\n4. Community and Support: Python has a large community and extensive documentation, which can be very helpful for troubleshooting and learning.\nGiven these points, Python is a suitable choice for this task.

Ideas: "".
We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 
As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).
Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

Chief Technology Officer: The task involves creating a CLI script generator for simple backups using `rsync` or `tar`. This task is relatively straightforward and involves string manipulation, file system operations, and command-line interface creation. 
Python is a great choice for this task because:
- It has a rich standard library that supports file operations and command-line interface creation.
- It has a simple and readable syntax, making the script easy to write and maintain.
- It has a large community and extensive documentation, which can be helpful if we encounter any issues.
- Python can easily generate shell scripts, which can then be executed to perform the backup operations.
Given these points, I propose Python as the programming language for this task.
<INFO> Python

Chief Executive Officer: While Python is indeed a great choice for this task due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive libraries, we should also consider the context of the task. The task specifically involves generating shell scripts that use `rsync` or `tar` for backup operations. These are Unix/Linux commands, and using a shell scripting language like Bash might be more intuitive for this specific use case.
However, given the requirement to generate these scripts programmatically and the benefits of Python mentioned by you, I agree that Python is a suitable choice. It can easily handle string manipulation, file system operations, and command-line interface creation, and it can generate shell scripts that use `rsync` or `tar`.
Therefore, I concur with your proposal.

<INFO> Python

Chief Technology Officer: The task is to create a CLI script generator for simple backups using `rsync` or `tar`. While Bash is indeed the native language for shell scripting and directly interacts with Unix/Linux commands, Python offers several advantages in this context:
1. **Readability and Maintainability**: Python's syntax is clean and easy to understand, which makes the code more maintainable, especially if the script generator needs to be extended in the future.
2. **Cross-Platform**: Python is cross-platform, which means the script generator can be run on different operating systems without modification.
3. **Libraries and Ecosystem**: Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries that can handle file operations, command-line interface creation, and even system calls, making the task more efficient.
4. **Community and Support**: Python has a large community and extensive documentation, which can be very helpful for troubleshooting and learning.
Given these points, Python is a suitable choice for this task. It can easily generate shell scripts that use `rsync` or `tar` for backup operations.

:. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).
