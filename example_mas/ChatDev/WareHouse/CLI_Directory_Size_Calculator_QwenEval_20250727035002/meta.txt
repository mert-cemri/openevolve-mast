Ideas:


Language:
 1. **Ease of Use and Understandability**: Python is renowned for its simplicity and readability, making it an excellent choice for rapid development.
2. **File and Directory Operations**: Python's `os` and `os.path` modules provide robust tools for navigating and manipulating the file system.
3. **Human-Readable File Sizes**: The `shutil` module includes a function `shutil.disk_usage` and `shutil.format_size` which can be used to convert file sizes to human-readable formats easily.

Given these points, Python is indeed the best choice for this task.
