The customer's request is for a CLI (Command Line Interface) timer and countdown tool. Given the options provided, we need to identify which modality best suits this requirement.

1. **Image**: This is not suitable as the tool requires interaction and real-time updates, which images cannot provide.
2. **Document**: This is also not suitable as documents are static and do not support real-time interaction.
3. **PowerPoint**: While presentations can be interactive, they are not designed for real-time updates and command-line interaction.
4. **Excel**: Excel can handle some real-time data updates but is not designed for command-line interaction.
5. **PDF**: PDFs are static and do not support real-time interaction or command-line input.
6. **Website**: Websites can be interactive and can handle real-time updates, but the customer specifically requested a CLI tool.
7. **Application**: Applications can be developed to handle command-line interaction and real-time updates, making this a strong candidate.
8. **Dashboard**: Dashboards are designed for real-time data visualization but do not inherently support command-line interaction.
9. **Mind Map**: Mind maps are visual tools for organizing ideas and do not support real-time interaction or command-line input.

Given the customer's requirement for a CLI tool, the most suitable modality is an **Application**. Applications can be developed using Python, which is mentioned in the provided options, and can handle command-line interaction and real-time updates.

You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a CLI timer and countdown tool. For the timer, it counts up from zero. For countdown, the user specifies a duration (e.g., 5m, 1h30s), and it counts down, notifying when finished..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

For countdown, the user specifies a duration (e.g., 5m, 1h30s), and it counts down, notifying when finished..\nTo complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.\n\nChief Executive Officer: ChatDev has made products in the following form before:\nImage: can present information in line chart, bar chart, flow chart, cloud chart, Gantt chart, etc.\nDocument: can present information via .docx files.\nPowerPoint: can present information via .pptx files.\nExcel: can present information via .xlsx files.\nPDF: can present information via .pdf files.\nWebsite: can present personal resume, tutorial, products, or ideas, via .html files.\nApplication: can implement visualized game, software, tool, etc, via python.\nDashboard: can display a panel visualizing real-time information.\nMind Map: can represent ideas, with related concepts arranged around a core concept.\nAs the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user\'s demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?\nNote that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word , followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., " PowerPoint".\n\nChief Product Officer: The customer\'s request is for a CLI (Command Line Interface) timer and countdown tool. Given the options provided, we need to identify which modality best suits this requirement.\n1. Image: This is not suitable as the tool requires interaction and real-time updates, which images cannot provide.\n2.

customer\'s requirement for a CLI (Command Line Interface) timer and countdown tool, we need to ensure that the product modality supports real-time interaction and command-line input. Here\'s a brief analysis of the provided options:\n1. Image: Not suitable for real-time interaction or command-line input.\n2. Document: Static and does not support real-time interaction or command-line input.\n3. PowerPoint: Can be interactive but not designed for real-time updates and command-line interaction.\n4. Excel: Can handle some real-time data updates but is not designed for command-line interaction.\n5. PDF: Static and does not support real-time interaction or command-line input.\n6. Website: Interactive and can handle real-time updates but not a CLI tool as requested.\n7. Application: Can be developed to handle command-line interaction and real-time updates, making this a strong candidate.\n8. Dashboard: Designed for real-time data visualization but not inherently for command-line interaction.\n9. Mind Map: Visual tool for organizing ideas, not suitable for real-time interaction or command-line input.\nConsidering the customer\'s specific requirement for a CLI tool, the most suitable modality is indeed an Application. Applications can be developed using Python, which is mentioned in the provided options, and can handle command-line interaction and real-time updates.\n Application\nAssistant:

As the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?
Note that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> PowerPoint".

Chief Product Officer: The customer's request is for a CLI (Command Line Interface) timer and countdown tool. Given the options provided, we need to identify which modality best suits this requirement.
1. **Image**: This is not suitable as the tool requires interaction and real-time updates, which images cannot provide.
2. **Document**: This is also not suitable as documents are static and do not support real-time interaction.
3. **PowerPoint**: While presentations can be interactive, they are not designed for real-time updates and command-line interaction.
4. **Excel**: Excel can handle some real-time data updates but is not designed for command-line interaction.
5. **PDF**: PDFs are static and do not support real-time interaction or command-line input.
6. **Website**: Websites can be interactive and can handle real-time updates, but the customer specifically requested a CLI tool.
7. **Application**: Applications can be developed to handle command-line interaction and real-time updates, making this a strong candidate.
8. **Dashboard**: Dashboards are designed for real-time data visualization but do not inherently support command-line interaction.
9. **Mind Map**: Mind maps are visual tools for organizing ideas and do not support real-time interaction or command-line input.
Given the customer's requirement for a CLI tool, the most suitable modality is an **Application**. Applications can be developed using Python, which is mentioned in the provided options, and can handle command-line interaction and real-time updates.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: Create a CLI timer and countdown tool. For the timer, it counts up from zero. For countdown, the user specifies a duration (e.g., 5m, 1h30s), and it counts down, notifying when finished..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Ideas: "".

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a CLI timer and countdown tool. For the timer, it counts up from zero. For countdown, the user specifies a duration (e.g., 5m, 1h30s), and it counts down, notifying when finished..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

The task involves creating a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for both timer and countdown functionalities. The requirements are straightforward and do not necessitate complex system-level operations or high-performance computing. Python is a versatile language with a rich standard library that includes modules for handling time and system operations, making it a strong candidate for this project.

Python's simplicity and readability will allow for rapid development and easy maintenance, which aligns well with the project's scope. Additionally, Python's extensive community support and numerous third-party libraries can be leveraged if needed, although they are not strictly necessary for this task.

Considering these factors, I propose Python as the target programming language for this project.

1. **Simplicity and Readability**: Python is indeed known for its simplicity and readability, which makes it a great choice for rapid development and maintenance.
2. **Standard Library**: Python's standard library includes modules like `time` and `datetime` which are perfect for handling timer and countdown functionalities.
3. **Community Support**: Python has a vast community and a wealth of third-party libraries, although they are not strictly necessary for this task, they can be beneficial if we decide to extend the tool's functionality in the future.
4. **CLI Development**: Python is well-suited for CLI applications, and libraries like `argparse` can be used to handle command-line arguments easily.

Given these points, Python is a strong candidate for this project. It meets all the requirements and aligns well with the project's scope.

Officer, to satisfy the new user\'s demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).\nNote that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "\ *" where "*" represents a programming language.\n\nChief Technology Officer: The task involves creating a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for both timer and countdown functionalities. The requirements are straightforward and do not necessitate complex system-level operations or high-performance computing. Python is a versatile language with a rich standard library that includes modules for handling time and system operations, making it a strong candidate for this project.\nPython\'s simplicity and readability will allow for rapid development and easy maintenance, which aligns well with the project\'s scope. Additionally, Python\'s extensive community support and numerous third-party libraries can be leveraged if needed, although they are not strictly necessary for this task.\nConsidering these factors, I propose Python as the target programming language for this project.\n\ Python\n\nChief Executive Officer: 1. **Simplicity and Readability**: Python is indeed known for its simplicity and readability, which makes it a great choice for rapid development and maintenance.\n2. **Standard Library**: Python\'s standard library includes modules like time and datetime which are perfect for handling timer and countdown functionalities.\n3. **Community Support**: Python has a vast community and a wealth of third-party libraries, although they are not strictly necessary for this task, they can be beneficial if we decide to extend the tool\'s functionality in the future.\n4. **CLI Development**: Python is well-suited for CLI applications, and libraries like argparse can be used to handle command-line arguments easily.\nGiven these points, Python is a strong candidate for this project. It meets all the requirements and aligns well with the project\'s scope.\n\ Python\n\nChief Executive Officer: 1. **Simplicity and Readability**: Python is indeed known for its simplicity and readability, which makes it a great choice for rapid development and maintenance.\n2. **Standard Library**: Python\'s standard library includes modules like time and datetime which are perfect for handling timer and countdown functionalities.\n3. **Community Support**: Python has a vast community and a wealth of third-party libraries, although they are not strictly necessary for this task, they can be beneficial if we decide to extend the tool\'s functionality in the future.\n4. **CLI Development**: Python is well-suited for CLI applications, and libraries like argparse can be used to handle command-line arguments easily.\nGiven these points, Python is a strong candidate for this project.

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 
As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).
Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

Chief Technology Officer: The task involves creating a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for both timer and countdown functionalities. The requirements are straightforward and do not necessitate complex system-level operations or high-performance computing. Python is a versatile language with a rich standard library that includes modules for handling time and system operations, making it a strong candidate for this project.
Python's simplicity and readability will allow for rapid development and easy maintenance, which aligns well with the project's scope. Additionally, Python's extensive community support and numerous third-party libraries can be leveraged if needed, although they are not strictly necessary for this task.
Considering these factors, I propose Python as the target programming language for this project.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: Create a CLI timer and countdown tool. For the timer, it counts up from zero. For countdown, the user specifies a duration (e.g., 5m, 1h30s), and it counts down, notifying when finished..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

| **phase_prompt** | According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below:  Task: "{task}". Task description: "{description}". Modality: "{modality}". Programming Language: "{language}" Ideas:"{ideas}" We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via {language}. As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. {gui} Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right. You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose. Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code: FILENAME ```LANGUAGE ''' DOCSTRING ''' CODE ``` You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).
