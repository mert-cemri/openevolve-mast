Here is a new customer's task: Write a CLI Hangman game. The program selects a random word, and the player guesses letters. Display the word with guessed letters filled in and track incorrect guesses..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Write a CLI Hangman game. The program selects a random word, and the player guesses letters. Display the word with guessed letters filled in and track incorrect guesses.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To create a CLI Hangman game in Python with a GUI, we'll use the `tkinter` library for the graphical interface. Here's a breakdown of the core components and their purposes:

### Core Components

1. **Main Application Class (`HangmanApp`)**:
   - Purpose: Initialize the GUI window, manage the game state, and handle user interactions.

2. **Game Logic Class (`HangmanGame`)**:
   - Purpose: Handle the game logic, including selecting a random word, checking guesses, and tracking incorrect guesses.

3. **Utility Functions**:
   - Purpose: Provide helper functions for tasks like selecting a random word from a list.

### File Structure

1. **main.py**: Contains the `HangmanApp` class and initializes the application.
2. **game_logic.py**: Contains the `HangmanGame` class and utility functions.

Let's start with the implementation:

### main.py

```python
'''

Main application file for the Hangman game using tkinter for GUI.

'''

import tkinter as tk
from game_logic import HangmanGame

class HangmanApp:
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = root
        self.root.title("Hangman Game")
        
        self.game = HangmanGame()
        
        self.word_display = tk.StringVar()
        self.word_display.set(self.game.get_display_word())
        
        self.incorrect_guesses = tk.StringVar()
        self.incorrect_guesses.set("Incorrect Guesses: ")
        
        self.create_widgets()
        
    def create_widgets(self):
        tk.Label(self.root, textvariable=self.word_display, font=("Helvetica", 18)).pack(pady=20)
        
        self.entry = tk.Entry(self.root, font=("Helvetica", 16))
        self.entry.pack(pady=10)
        
        tk.Button(self.root, text="Guess", command=self.make_guess).pack(pady=10)
        
        tk.Label(self.root, textvariable=self.incorrect_guesses, font=("Helvetica", 14)).pack(pady=20)
        
    def make_guess(self):
        letter = self.entry.get().strip().lower()
        self.entry.delete(0, tk.END)
        
        if len(letter) == 1 and letter.isalpha():
            self.game.guess_letter(letter)
            self.word_display.set(self.game.get_display_word())
            self.incorrect_guesses.set(f"Incorrect Guesses: {', '.join(self.game.incorrect_guesses)}")
            
            if self.game.is_won():
                self.word_display.set("Congratulations! You've won!")
            elif self.game.is_lost():
                self.word_display.set(f"Game Over! The word was: {self.game.word}")
        else:
            self.incorrect_guesses.set("Please enter a valid single letter.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = HangmanApp(root)
    root.mainloop()
```

### game_logic.py

```python
'''

Game logic for the Hangman game, including word selection and guess handling.

'''

import random

class HangmanGame:
    def __init__(self):
        self.words = ["python", "hangman", "challenge", "programming", "developer"]
        self.word = random.choice(self.words)
        self.guessed_letters = set()
        self.incorrect_guesses = []
        self.max_incorrect = 6
        
    def get_display_word(self):

    def is_lost(self):
        return len(self.incorrect_guesses) >= self.max_incorrect
```

### Explanation

- **main.py**: This file sets up the GUI using `tkinter`. It initializes the game, displays the current state of the word, and handles user input for guessing letters.
- **game_logic.py**: This file contains the core game logic, including selecting a random word, checking guesses, and determining if the game is won or lost.

This implementation provides a basic GUI-based Hangman game using Python's `tkinter` library. The game logic is separated from the GUI to maintain a clean architecture.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The provided code is designed for a GUI application using Tkinter, but the task specifies creating a CLI (Command Line Interface) Hangman game. This is a significant deviation from the user's requirements. The highest priority is to revise the code to meet the CLI requirement.

**Comment with Highest Priority:**
The current implementation uses Tkinter for a GUI application, which does not align with the user's request for a CLI Hangman game. The code needs to be refactored to run in a command-line environment without any GUI components.

**Instructions for Revision:**
1. Remove all Tkinter-related code and classes.
2. Implement a CLI-based game loop in the `main.py` file that:
   - Displays the current state of the word with guessed letters.
   - Prompts the user to input a letter guess.
   - Updates the display based on correct or incorrect guesses.
   - Tracks and displays incorrect guesses.
   - Ends the game when the word is guessed or the maximum number of incorrect guesses is reached.
3. Ensure the game logic in `game_logic.py` remains unchanged, as it is suitable for both GUI and CLI implementations.

By making these changes, the application will meet the user's requirements for a CLI Hangman game.

In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Write a CLI Hangman game. The program selects a random word, and the player guesses letters. Display the word with guessed letters filled in and track incorrect guesses..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Ensure the game logic in game_logic.py remains unchanged, as it is suitable for both GUI and CLI implementations.\n\nBy making these changes, the application will meet the user's requirements for a CLI Hangman game."} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Write a CLI Hangman game. The program selects a random word, and the player guesses letters. Display the word with guessed letters filled in and track incorrect guesses..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Based on the provided code for the CLI Hangman game, there are no external dependencies or packages required beyond the standard Python library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty or can simply contain a comment indicating that no additional packages are needed. Here is how you can write it:

```plaintext
# No external dependencies required for this project.
```

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:
