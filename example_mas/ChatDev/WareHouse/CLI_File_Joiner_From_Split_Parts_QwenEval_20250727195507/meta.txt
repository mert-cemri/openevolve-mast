Task:
Build a CLI program to join multiple file parts (created by a file splitter) back into a single original file. The user specifies the first part name.

 ### Task Breakdown
1. **Understand the Input**: The user specifies the first part name of the file.
2. **Identify File Parts**: The program should identify all parts of the file based on the naming convention (e.g., `filename.part01`, `filename.part02`, etc.).
3. **Join the Parts**: The program should concatenate all parts in the correct order to form the original file.
4. **Output the Result**: The program should output the reconstructed file.

### Implementation Plan
We'll write a CLI program in Python, which is a versatile and widely-used language for such tasks. The program will:
- Accept the first part name as a command-line argument.
- Use the naming convention to find all parts.
- Concatenate the parts into a single file.
- Save the reconstructed file with the original filename (without the `.partXX` suffix).

### Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Parse Command-Line Arguments**: Use the `argparse` module to handle command-line arguments.
2. **Identify File Parts**: Use the `glob` module to find all parts based on the naming convention.
3. **Concatenate File Parts**: Open each part in binary mode and write its contents to the output file.
4. **Handle Errors**: Ensure the program handles errors gracefully, such as missing parts or incorrect naming conventions.

### Example Code
Here is a sample implementation of the above plan:

```python
import argparse
import glob
import os

def join_file_parts(first_part):
    # Extract the base filename (without the .partXX suffix)
    base_filename = os.path.splitext(os.path.splitext(first_part)[0])[0]
    
    # Create a pattern to match all parts
    pattern = f"{base_filename}.part*"
    
    # Find all parts
    parts = sorted(glob.glob(pattern))
    
    if not parts:
        print(f"No parts found for the pattern: {pattern}")
        return
    
    # Create the output file
    output_filename = f"{base_filename}"
    with open(output_filename, 'wb') as outfile:
        for part in parts:
            with open(part, 'rb') as infile:
                outfile.write(infile.read())
    
    print(f"Reconstructed file saved as: {output_filename}")

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Join multiple file parts into a single file.")
    parser.add_argument("first_part", help="The name of the first part file (e.g., filename.part01)")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    join_file_parts(args.first_part)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
- **Argument Parsing**: The `argparse` module is used to parse the command-line argument for the first part filename.
- **Pattern Matching**: The `glob` module is used to find all files matching the pattern derived from the first part filename.
- **File Concatenation**: Each part is opened in binary mode and written to the output file in sequence.
- **Output**: The reconstructed file is saved with the original filename.

### Testing
To test the program, you can create a few sample parts and run the program with the first part as an argument. For example:
```bash
python join_file_parts.py filename.part01
```

This should reconstruct the original file from the parts.
