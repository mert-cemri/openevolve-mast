The user's needs are not explicitly detailed in the task description, so we need to consider the strengths of each product modality and how they might align with potential user requirements.

1. **Image**: Best for visualizing data in a static format. If the user needs to present data trends or relationships, this could be a good choice.
2. **Document**: Ideal for detailed textual information. If the user needs to provide a comprehensive explanation or report, this might be suitable.
3. **PowerPoint**: Excellent for presentations with a mix of text and visuals. If the user needs to create a dynamic, engaging presentation, this could be the best option.
4. **Excel**: Perfect for data manipulation and analysis. If the user needs to perform calculations or analyze data, this would be ideal.
5. **PDF**: Useful for sharing documents in a format that preserves the layout. If the user needs to distribute a document that should not be easily edited, this could be a good choice.
6. **Website**: Great for creating an interactive experience or sharing information online. If the user needs to create a portfolio, tutorial, or product showcase, this could be suitable.
7. **Application**: Best for creating interactive software tools or games. If the user needs to develop a tool or game, this would be the right choice.
8. **Dashboard**: Ideal for real-time data visualization. If the user needs to monitor data in real-time, this could be the best option.
9. **Mind Map**: Useful for organizing ideas and concepts visually. If the user needs to brainstorm or plan a project, this could be a good choice.

Given the variety of options, we need to consider which one aligns best with the user's needs. Since the user's specific requirements are not provided, we should lean towards a versatile and commonly used modality that can be adapted to various needs.

Considering the versatility and common use, **PowerPoint** seems like a strong candidate as it allows for a mix of text, images, and can be easily adapted for various presentation needs.

You are Chief Product Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are responsible for all product-related matters in ChatDev. Usually includes product design, product strategy, product vision, product innovation, project management and product marketing.
Here is a new customer's task: .
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Given the user's needs are not explicitly detailed, we should consider the strengths of each product modality and how they might align with potential user requirements.

1. **Image**: Best for visualizing data in a static format. If the user needs to present data trends or relationships, this could be a good choice.
2. **Document**: Ideal for detailed textual information. If the user needs to provide a comprehensive explanation or report, this might be suitable.
3. **PowerPoint**: Excellent for presentations with a mix of text and visuals. If the user needs to create a dynamic, engaging presentation, this could be the best option.
4. **Excel**: Perfect for data manipulation and analysis. If the user needs to perform calculations or analyze data, this would be ideal.
5. **PDF**: Useful for sharing documents in a format that preserves the layout. If the user needs to distribute a document that should not be easily edited, this could be a good choice.
6. **Website**: Great for creating an interactive experience or sharing information online. If the user needs to create a portfolio, tutorial, or product showcase, this could be suitable.
7. **Application**: Best for creating interactive software tools or games. If the user needs to develop a tool or game, this would be the right choice.
8. **Dashboard**: Ideal for real-time data visualization. If the user needs to monitor data in real-time, this could be the best option.
9. **Mind Map**: Useful for organizing ideas and concepts visually. If the user needs to brainstorm or plan a project, this could be a good choice.

Since the user's needs are not explicitly detailed, we should lean towards a versatile and commonly used modality that can be adapted to various needs. Considering the versatility and common use, **PowerPoint** seems like a strong candidate as it allows for a mix of text, images, and can be easily adapted for various presentation needs.

However, if the user needs to share detailed information without the need for interactivity, a **Document** might be more appropriate. If the user needs to perform data analysis, **Excel** would be ideal. If the user needs to share information online, a **Website** could be the best choice.

Given the lack of specific details, and considering the need for a versatile and commonly used modality, **PowerPoint** remains a strong candidate.

Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word , followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., " PowerPoint".\n\nChief Product Officer: The user\'s needs are not explicitly detailed in the task description, so we need to consider the strengths of each product modality and how they might align with potential user requirements.\n1. Image: Best for visualizing data in a static format. If the user needs to present data trends or relationships, this could be a good choice.\n2. Document: Ideal for detailed textual information. If the user needs to provide a comprehensive explanation or report, this might be suitable.\n3. PowerPoint: Excellent for presentations with a mix of text and visuals. If the user needs to create a dynamic, engaging presentation, this could be the best option.\n4. Excel: Perfect for data manipulation and analysis. If the user needs to perform calculations or analyze data, this would be ideal.\n5. PDF: Useful for sharing documents in a format that preserves the layout. If the user needs to distribute a document that should not be easily edited, this could be a good choice.\n6. Website: Great for creating an interactive experience or sharing information online. If the user needs to create a portfolio, tutorial, or product showcase, this could be suitable.\n7. Application: Best for creating interactive software tools or games. If the user needs to develop a tool or game, this would be the right choice.\n8. Dashboard: Ideal for real-time data visualization. If the user needs to monitor data in real-time, this could be the best option.\n9. Mind Map: Useful for organizing ideas and concepts visually. If the user needs to brainstorm or plan a project, this could be a good choice.\nGiven the variety of options, we need to consider which one aligns best with the user\'s needs. Since the user\'s specific requirements are not provided, we should lean towards a versatile and commonly used modality that can be adapted to various needs.\nConsidering the versatility and common use, PowerPoint seems like a strong candidate as it allows for a mix of text, images, and can be easily adapted for various presentation needs.\n PowerPoint\n\nChief Executive Officer: Given the user\'s needs are not explicitly detailed, we should consider the strengths of each product modality and how they might align with potential user requirements.\n1.

Here is a conversation between two roles: Chief Executive Officer: ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.

Chief Executive Officer: ChatDev has made products in the following form before:
Image: can present information in line chart, bar chart, flow chart, cloud chart, Gantt chart, etc.
Document: can present information via .docx files.
PowerPoint: can present information via .pptx files.
Excel: can present information via .xlsx files.
PDF: can present information via .pdf files.
Website: can present personal resume, tutorial, products, or ideas, via .html files.
Application: can implement visualized game, software, tool, etc, via python.
Dashboard: can display a panel visualizing real-time information.
Mind Map: can represent ideas, with related concepts arranged around a core concept.
As the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?
Note that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> PowerPoint".

Chief Product Officer: The user's needs are not explicitly detailed in the task description, so we need to consider the strengths of each product modality and how they might align with potential user requirements.
1. **Image**: Best for visualizing data in a static format. If the user needs to present data trends or relationships, this could be a good choice.
2. **Document**: Ideal for detailed textual information. If the user needs to provide a comprehensive explanation or report, this might be suitable.
3. **PowerPoint**: Excellent for presentations with a mix of text and visuals. If the user needs to create a dynamic, engaging presentation, this could be the best option.
4. **Excel**: Perfect for data manipulation and analysis. If the user needs to perform calculations or analyze data, this would be ideal.
5. **PDF**: Useful for sharing documents in a format that preserves the layout. If the user needs to distribute a document that should not be easily edited, this could be a good choice.
6. **Website**: Great for creating an interactive experience or sharing information online. If the user needs to create a portfolio, tutorial, or product showcase, this could be suitable.
7. **Application**: Best for creating interactive software tools or games. If the user needs to develop a tool or game, this would be the right choice.
8. **Dashboard**: Ideal for real-time data visualization. If the user needs to monitor data in real-time, this could be the best option.
9. **Mind Map**: Useful for organizing ideas and concepts visually. If the user needs to brainstorm or plan a project, this could be a good choice.
Given the variety of options, we need to consider which one aligns best with the user's needs. Since the user's specific requirements are not provided, we should lean towards a versatile and commonly used modality that can be adapted to various needs.
Considering the versatility and common use, **PowerPoint** seems like a strong candidate as it allows for a mix of text, images, and can be easily adapted for various presentation needs.
