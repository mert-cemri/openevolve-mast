Given the nature of the task, which is to create a CLI Morse code translator, I believe the most suitable product modality would be an "Application." This is because a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool is essentially a software application that runs in a terminal or command prompt, and it aligns well with our capability to implement tools via Python. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. A CLI tool is best suited as an "Application" since it involves creating a functional software tool that users can interact with through a command line interface. This aligns perfectly with our expertise in developing applications using Python.

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Create a CLI Morse code translator. It should translate English text to Morse code and Morse code (dots and dashes) back to English text.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python *"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python *. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a CLI Morse code translator. It should translate English text to Morse code and Morse code (dots and dashes) back to English text..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To create a CLI Morse code translator with a GUI using Python, we will use the `tkinter` library for the graphical interface. The application will consist of the following core components:

1. **MorseCodeTranslator**: A class responsible for translating English text to Morse code and vice versa.
   - `text_to_morse(text)`: Converts English text to Morse code.
   - `morse_to_text(morse)`: Converts Morse code to English text.

2. **MorseCodeApp**: A class responsible for the GUI application.
   - `__init__(self, root)`: Initializes the GUI components.
   - `translate_to_morse(self)`: Handles the translation of text to Morse code when the user clicks the corresponding button.
   - `translate_to_text(self)`: Handles the translation of Morse code to text when the user clicks the corresponding button.

3. **main.py**: The main file to run the application.

Let's implement the code step by step.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Create a CLI Morse code translator. It should translate English text to Morse code and Morse code (dots and dashes) back to English text..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The provided code is designed to create a GUI application using `tkinter`, but the task requires a CLI (Command Line Interface) application. This is a significant deviation from the user's requirements. The highest priority comment is to revise the implementation to create a CLI-based Morse code translator instead of a GUI-based one.

### Suggested Revision:

1. **Remove GUI Components**: Eliminate the use of `tkinter` and any GUI-related components.
2. **Implement CLI Functionality**: Create a command-line interface that allows users to input text and receive translations directly in the terminal.
3. **Ensure Functionality**: Implement the `MorseCodeTranslator` class with methods `text_to_morse` and `morse_to_text` to handle the translation logic.

Here's a basic outline for a CLI-based Morse code translator:

```python
# morse_code_translator.py
class MorseCodeTranslator:
    MORSE_CODE_DICT = {
        'A': '.-', 'B': '-...', 'C': '-.-.', 'D': '-..', 'E': '.', 'F': '..-.', 'G': '--.', 'H': '....', 'I': '..',

        '(': '-.--.', ')': '-.--.-', ' ': '/'
    }

    @staticmethod
    def text_to_morse(text):

    @staticmethod
    def morse_to_text(morse):
        reverse_dict = {v: k for k, v in MorseCodeTranslator.MORSE_CODE_DICT.items()}
        return ''.join(reverse_dict.get(code, '') for code in morse.split())

# main.py
def main():
    while True:
        choice = input("Choose an option: (1) Text to Morse (2) Morse to Text (3) Exit: ")
        if choice == '1':

Comments on Codes:
"The provided code is designed to create a GUI application using `tkinter`, but the task requires a CLI (Command Line Interface) application. This is a significant deviation from the user's requirements. The highest priority comment is to revise the implementation to create a CLI-based Morse code translator instead of a GUI-based one.

### Suggested Revision:

1. **Remove GUI Components**: Eliminate the use of `tkinter` and any GUI-related components.
2. **Implement CLI Functionality**: Create a command-line interface that allows users to input text and receive translations directly in the terminal.
3. **Ensure Functionality**: Implement the `MorseCodeTranslator` class with methods `text_to_morse` and `morse_to_text` to handle the translation logic.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Create a CLI Morse code translator. It should translate English text to Morse code and Morse code (dots and dashes) back to English text..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The provided code includes a GUI application using `tkinter`, which is not aligned with the user's task of creating a CLI (Command Line Interface) Morse code translator. The main focus should be on ensuring that the CLI functionality is fully implemented and operational. The `main.py` file does provide a CLI interface, but the `morse_code_translator` module, which is supposed to contain the translation logic, is missing. This is a critical issue because without this module, the application cannot perform any translations.

**Comment with the highest priority:** The `morse_code_translator` module is missing, which is essential for the translation functionality. This module should include the `text_to_morse` and `morse_to_text` methods to handle the conversion between English text and Morse code.

**Instructions on how to fix:**

1. **Create the `morse_code_translator.py` module**: Implement the `MorseCodeTranslator` class with the necessary methods for translation.

```python
# morse_code_translator.py
class MorseCodeTranslator:
    # Morse code dictionary
    MORSE_CODE_DICT = {
        'A': '.-', 'B': '-...', 'C': '-.-.', 'D': '-..', 'E': '.', 'F': '..-.', 'G': '--.', 'H': '....',
        'I': '..', 'J': '.---', 'K': '-.-', 'L': '.-..', 'M': '--', 'N': '-.', 'O': '---', 'P': '.--.',
        'Q': '--.-', 'R': '.-.', 'S': '...', 'T': '-', 'U': '..-', 'V': '...-', 'W': '.--', 'X': '-..-',
        'Y': '-.--', 'Z': '--..', '1': '.----', '2': '..---', '3': '...--', '4': '....-', '5': '.....',
        '6': '-....', '7': '--...', '8': '---..', '9': '----.', '0': '-----', ', ': '--..--', '.': '.-.-.-',
        '?': '..--..', '/': '-..-.', '-': '-....-', '(': '-.--.', ')': '-.--.-', ' ': '/'
    }

    @staticmethod
    def text_to_morse(text):
        '''Converts English text to Morse code.'''
        return ' '.join(MorseCodeTranslator.MORSE_CODE_DICT.get(char.upper(), '') for char in text)

    @staticmethod
    def morse_to_text(morse):
        '''Converts Morse code to English text.'''
        morse_to_text_dict = {v: k for k, v in MorseCodeTranslator.MORSE_CODE_DICT.items()}
        return ''.join(morse_to_text_dict.get(code, '') for code in morse.split(' '))

```

2. **Ensure the CLI application in `main.py` uses this module**: The `main.py` file already references this module, so once implemented, the CLI should work as expected.

By implementing the `morse_code_translator.py` module, the application will be able to perform the required translations, fulfilling the user's task requirements.

Comments on Codes:
"The provided code includes a GUI application using `tkinter`, which is not aligned with the user's task of creating a CLI (Command Line Interface) Morse code translator. The main focus should be on ensuring that the CLI functionality is fully implemented and operational. The `main.py` file does provide a CLI interface, but the `morse_code_translator` module, which is supposed to contain the translation logic, is missing. This is a critical issue because without this module, the application cannot perform any translations.

**Comment with the highest priority:** The `morse_code_translator` module is missing, which is essential for the translation functionality. This module should include the `text_to_morse` and `morse_to_text` methods to handle the conversion between English text and Morse code.

**Instructions on how to fix:**

1. **Create the `morse_code_translator.py` module**: Implement the `MorseCodeTranslator` class with the necessary methods for translation.

```python
# morse_code_translator.py
class MorseCodeTranslator:
    # Morse code dictionary
    MORSE_CODE_DICT = {
        'A': '.-', 'B': '-...', 'C': '-.-.', 'D': '-..', 'E': '.', 'F': '..-.', 'G': '--.', 'H': '....',
        'I': '..', 'J': '.---', 'K': '-.-', 'L': '.-..', 'M': '--', 'N': '-.', 'O': '---', 'P': '.--.',
        'Q': '--.-', 'R': '.-.', 'S': '...', 'T': '-', 'U': '..-', 'V': '...-', 'W': '.--', 'X': '-..-',
        'Y': '-.--', 'Z': '--..', '1': '.----', '2': '..---', '3': '...--', '4': '....-', '5': '.....',
        '6': '-....', '7': '--...', '8': '---..', '9': '----.', '0': '-----', ', ': '--..--', '.': '.-.-.-',
        '?': '..--..', '/': '-..-.', '-': '-....-', '(': '-.--.', ')': '-.--.-', ' ': '/'
    }

    @staticmethod
    def text_to_morse(text):
        '''Converts English text to Morse code.'''
        return ' '.join(MorseCodeTranslator.MORSE_CODE_DICT.get(char.upper(), '') for char in text)

    @staticmethod
    def morse_to_text(morse):
        '''Converts Morse code to English text.'''
        morse_to_text_dict = {v: k for k, v in MorseCodeTranslator.MORSE_CODE_DICT.items()}
        return ''.join(morse_to_text_dict.get(code, '') for code in morse.split(' '))

```

2. **Ensure the CLI application in `main.py` uses this module**: The `main.py` file already references this module, so once implemented, the CLI should work as expected.

By implementing the `morse_code_translator.py` module, the application will be able to perform the required translations, fulfilling the user's task requirements."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a CLI Morse code translator. It should translate English text to Morse code and Morse code (dots and dashes) back to English text..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The highest priority comment is that the provided code includes a GUI implementation using `tkinter`, which is not aligned with the task requirement of creating a CLI (Command Line Interface) Morse code translator. The task specifically asks for a CLI application, but the `morse_code_app.py` file is designed for a GUI application. 

To fix this, you should remove the `morse_code_app.py` file and ensure that the CLI functionality in `main.py` is complete and functional. Additionally, ensure that the `MorseCodeTranslator` class is implemented with the necessary methods (`text_to_morse` and `morse_to_text`) in a separate module (`morse_code_translator.py`) to handle the translation logic.

Here are the steps to revise the code:

1. **Remove GUI Code**: Delete or ignore the `morse_code_app.py` file since it is not required for a CLI application.

2. **Implement MorseCodeTranslator**: Ensure that the `MorseCodeTranslator` class is implemented with the necessary methods in a separate file (`morse_code_translator.py`). Here is a basic implementation:

   ```python
   # morse_code_translator.py
   class MorseCodeTranslator:
       MORSE_CODE_DICT = {
           'A': '.-', 'B': '-...', 'C': '-.-.', 'D': '-..', 'E': '.', 'F': '..-.',
           'G': '--.', 'H': '....', 'I': '..', 'J': '.---', 'K': '-.-', 'L': '.-..',
           'M': '--', 'N': '-.', 'O': '---', 'P': '.--.', 'Q': '--.-', 'R': '.-.',
           'S': '...', 'T': '-', 'U': '..-', 'V': '...-', 'W': '.--', 'X': '-..-',
           'Y': '-.--', 'Z': '--..', '1': '.----', '2': '..---', '3': '...--',
           '4': '....-', '5': '.....', '6': '-....', '7': '--...', '8': '---..',
           '9': '----.', '0': '-----', ', ': '--..--', '.': '.-.-.-', '?': '..--..',
           '/': '-..-.', '-': '-....-', '(': '-.--.', ')': '-.--.-', ' ': '/'
       }

       @staticmethod
       def text_to_morse(text):
           '''Converts English text to Morse code.'''
           return ' '.join(MorseCodeTranslator.MORSE_CODE_DICT.get(char.upper(), '') for char in text)

       @staticmethod
       def morse_to_text(morse):
           '''Converts Morse code to English text.'''
           reverse_dict = {v: k for k, v in MorseCodeTranslator.MORSE_CODE_DICT.items()}
           return ''.join(reverse_dict.get(code, '') for code in morse.split(' '))
   ```

3. **Ensure CLI Functionality**: Verify that the `main.py` file correctly uses the `MorseCodeTranslator` class for translations and handles user input/output as expected.

By following these steps, the application will meet the user's requirements for a CLI Morse code translator.

Additionally, ensure that the `MorseCodeTranslator` class is implemented with the necessary methods (`text_to_morse` and `morse_to_text`) in a separate module (`morse_code_translator.py`) to handle the translation logic.

Here are the steps to revise the code:

1. **Remove GUI Code**: Delete or ignore the `morse_code_app.py` file since it is not required for a CLI application.

2. **Implement MorseCodeTranslator**: Ensure that the `MorseCodeTranslator` class is implemented with the necessary methods in a separate file (`morse_code_translator.py`). Here is a basic implementation:

   ```python
   # morse_code_translator.py
   class MorseCodeTranslator:
       MORSE_CODE_DICT = {
           'A': '.-', 'B': '-...', 'C': '-.-.', 'D': '-..', 'E': '.', 'F': '..-.',
           'G': '--.', 'H': '....', 'I': '..', 'J': '.---', 'K': '-.-', 'L': '.-..',
           'M': '--', 'N': '-.', 'O': '---', 'P': '.--.', 'Q': '--.-', 'R': '.-.',
           'S': '...', 'T': '-', 'U': '..-', 'V': '...-', 'W': '.--', 'X': '-..-',
           'Y': '-.--', 'Z': '--..', '1': '.----', '2': '..---', '3': '...--',
           '4': '....-', '5': '.....', '6': '-....', '7': '--...', '8': '---..',
           '9': '----.', '0': '-----', ', ': '--..--', '.': '.-.-.-', '?': '..--..',
           '/': '-..-.', '-': '-....-', '(': '-.--.', ')': '-.--.-', ' ': '/'
       }

       @staticmethod
       def text_to_morse(text):
           '''Converts English text to Morse code.'''
           return ' '.join(MorseCodeTranslator.MORSE_CODE_DICT.get(char.upper(), '') for char in text)

       @staticmethod
       def morse_to_text(morse):
           '''Converts Morse code to English text.'''
           reverse_dict = {v: k for k, v in MorseCodeTranslator.MORSE_CODE_DICT.items()}
           return ''.join(reverse_dict.get(code, '') for code in morse.split(' '))
   ```

3. **Ensure CLI Functionality**: Verify that the `main.py` file correctly uses the `MorseCodeTranslator` class for translations and handles user input/output as expected.

By following these steps, the application will meet the user's requirements for a CLI Morse code translator.

Comments on Codes:
"The highest priority comment is that the provided code includes a GUI implementation using `tkinter`, which is not aligned with the task requirement of creating a CLI (Command Line Interface) Morse code translator. The task specifically asks for a CLI application, but the `morse_code_app.py` file is designed for a GUI application. 

To fix this, you should remove the `morse_code_app.py` file and ensure that the CLI functionality in `main.py` is complete and functional. Additionally, ensure that the `MorseCodeTranslator` class is implemented with the necessary methods (`text_to_morse` and `morse_to_text`) in a separate module (`morse_code_translator.py`) to handle the translation logic.

Here are the steps to revise the code:

1. **Remove GUI Code**: Delete or ignore the `morse_code_app.py` file since it is not required for a CLI application.

2. **Implement MorseCodeTranslator**: Ensure that the `MorseCodeTranslator` class is implemented with the necessary methods in a separate file (`morse_code_translator.py`). Here is a basic implementation:

   ```python
   # morse_code_translator.py
   class MorseCodeTranslator:
       MORSE_CODE_DICT = {
           'A': '.-', 'B': '-...', 'C': '-.-.', 'D': '-..', 'E': '.', 'F': '..-.',
           'G': '--.', 'H': '....', 'I': '..', 'J': '.---', 'K': '-.-', 'L': '.-..',
           'M': '--', 'N': '-.', 'O': '---', 'P': '.--.', 'Q': '--.-', 'R': '.-.',
           'S': '...', 'T': '-', 'U': '..-', 'V': '...-', 'W': '.--', 'X': '-..-',
           'Y': '-.--', 'Z': '--..', '1': '.----', '2': '..---', '3': '...--',
           '4': '....-', '5': '.....', '6': '-....', '7': '--...', '8': '---..',
           '9': '----.', '0': '-----', ', ': '--..--', '.': '.-.-.-', '?': '..--..',
           '/': '-..-.', '-': '-....-', '(': '-.--.', ')': '-.--.-', ' ': '/'
       }

       @staticmethod
       def text_to_morse(text):
           '''Converts English text to Morse code.'''
           return ' '.join(MorseCodeTranslator.MORSE_CODE_DICT.get(char.upper(), '') for char in text)

       @staticmethod
       def morse_to_text(morse):
           '''Converts Morse code to English text.'''
           reverse_dict = {v: k for k, v in MorseCodeTranslator.MORSE_CODE_DICT.items()}
           return ''.join(reverse_dict.get(code, '') for code in morse.split(' '))
   ```

3. **Ensure CLI Functionality**: Verify that the `main.py` file correctly uses the `MorseCodeTranslator` class for translations and handles user input/output as expected.

By following these steps, the application will meet the user's requirements for a CLI Morse code translator."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a CLI Morse code translator. It should translate English text to Morse code and Morse code (dots and dashes) back to English text..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Certainly! Let's revise the code to ensure it meets the user's requirements for a CLI-based Morse code translator. We'll remove the GUI components and focus on the CLI functionality, ensuring that the `MorseCodeTranslator` class is implemented correctly.

Here's the complete and revised code:

**morse_code_translator.py**
```python
'''
This module contains the MorseCodeTranslator class which provides methods
to translate between English text and Morse code.
'''
class MorseCodeTranslator:
    MORSE_CODE_DICT = {
        'A': '.-', 'B': '-...', 'C': '-.-.', 'D': '-..', 'E': '.', 'F': '..-.',
        'G': '--.', 'H': '....', 'I': '..', 'J': '.---', 'K': '-.-', 'L': '.-..',
        'M': '--', 'N': '-.', 'O': '---', 'P': '.--.', 'Q': '--.-', 'R': '.-.',

        'Y': '-.--', 'Z': '--..', '1': '.----', '2': '..---', '3': '...--',
        '4': '....-', '5': '.....', '6': '-....', '7': '--...', '8': '---..',
        '9': '----.', '0': '-----', ', ': '--..--', '.': '.-.-.-', '?': '..--..',
        '/': '-..-.', '-': '-....-', '(': '-.--.', ')': '-.--.-', ' ': '/'
    }

    @staticmethod
    def text_to_morse(text):
        '''Converts English text to Morse code.'''
        return ' '.join(MorseCodeTranslator.MORSE_CODE_DICT.get(char.upper(), '') for char in text)

    @staticmethod
    def morse_to_text(morse):
        '''Converts Morse code to English text.'''
        reverse_dict = {v: k for k, v in MorseCodeTranslator.MORSE_CODE_DICT.items()}
        return ''.join(reverse_dict.get(code, '') for code in morse.split(' '))
```

**main.py**
```python
'''
This is the main module to run the CLI-based Morse Code Translator application.
'''
from morse_code_translator import MorseCodeTranslator

def main():
    '''Runs the CLI-based Morse Code Translator application.'''
    while True:
        choice = input("Choose an option: (1) Text to Morse (2) Morse to Text (3) Exit: ")
        if choice == '1':
            text = input("Enter text to convert to Morse code: ")
            print("Morse Code:", MorseCodeTranslator.text_to_morse(text))
        elif choice == '2':
            morse = input("Enter Morse code to convert to text: ")
            print("Text:", MorseCodeTranslator.morse_to_text(morse))
        elif choice == '3':
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

These changes ensure that the application is a CLI-based Morse code translator, as required by the task. The `MorseCodeTranslator` class handles the translation logic, and `main.py` provides the command-line interface for user interaction.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Here is a new customer's task: Create a CLI Morse code translator. It should translate English text to Morse code and Morse code (dots and dashes) back to English text..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code snippets, the project uses the `tkinter` library for the GUI component. However, `tkinter` is part of the Python Standard Library, so it doesn't need to be included in the `requirements.txt` file. The code also references a module named `morse_code_translator`, which seems to be a custom module rather than an external package. Therefore, there are no additional external dependencies explicitly mentioned in the code snippets provided.

However, if there are any other dependencies used in the `morse_code_translator` module or elsewhere in the project that are not shown here, they should be included in the `requirements.txt` file. Assuming no other external packages are required, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. If you discover additional dependencies, you can add them to the file.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file based on the current information:

```
# No external dependencies required based on the provided code snippets.
```

If you find that the `morse_code_translator` module or other parts of the project require additional packages, you should update the `requirements.txt` file accordingly.

Assuming no other external packages are required, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. If you discover additional dependencies, you can add them to the file.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file based on the current information:

```
# No external dependencies required based on the provided code snippets.
```

If you find that the `morse_code_translator` module or other parts of the project require additional packages, you should update the `requirements.txt` file accordingly.
