Given the nature of the task, which is to build a CLI number guessing game, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application." This is because the task involves creating an interactive program that requires user input and logic processing, which aligns well with the capabilities of a Python-based application. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Build a CLI number guessing game. The program generates a random number, and the user tries to guess it, receiving hints (higher/lower) until they guess correctly.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To create a CLI number guessing game with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python, we will use the `tkinter` library, which is a standard GUI toolkit in Python. Below are the core components of the application:

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **GameApp**: This class will manage the main application window and the game logic.
   - **__init__**: Initialize the GUI components and game variables.
   - **start_game**: Start a new game by generating a random number.
   - **check_guess**: Check the user's guess and provide feedback (higher/lower).
   - **reset_game**: Reset the game to allow the user to play again.

2. **main**: The entry point of the application to start the GUI.

### File Structure

1. **main.py**: Contains the main application logic and GUI setup.

Now, let's implement the code for each file.

#### main.py

```python
'''

This module contains the main application logic for a number guessing game with a GUI using tkinter.

        except ValueError:

    def reset_game(self):

```

This code creates a simple number guessing game with a GUI using `tkinter`. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user can input guesses to find the correct number. The application provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and it allows the user to reset the game to play again.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Build a CLI number guessing game. The program generates a random number, and the user tries to guess it, receiving hints (higher/lower) until they guess correctly..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The provided code is designed for a GUI application using `tkinter`, but the task specifies a CLI (Command Line Interface) application. This is a significant deviation from the user's requirements. The highest priority comment is to rewrite the code to fit the CLI requirement.

**Suggestion for Revision:**

1. Remove the `tkinter` GUI components and replace them with standard input/output operations to interact with the user via the command line.
2. Implement a loop to continuously prompt the user for guesses and provide feedback until the correct number is guessed.

Here is a revised version of the code for a CLI application:

```python
import random

def start_game():
    '''
    Start a new game by generating a random number and prompting the user to guess.
    '''
    random_number = random.randint(1, 100)
    print("Guess the number between 1 and 100")
    
    while True:
        try:
            guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))
            if guess < random_number:
                print("Higher!")
            elif guess > random_number:
                print("Lower!")
            else:
                print("Correct! You guessed it!")
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid number.")

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the provided Python CLI number guessing game, there are no external dependencies or packages required beyond the standard Python library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, as the game only uses built-in Python modules. However, to maintain best practices, you can still create an empty `requirements.txt` file to indicate that no additional packages are needed.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies are required for this project.
```

This file serves as a placeholder to indicate that the project does not rely on any third-party libraries.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided Python CLI number guessing game, there are no external dependencies or packages required beyond the standard Python library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, as the game only uses built-in Python modules. However, to maintain best practices, you can still create an empty `requirements.txt` file to indicate that no additional packages are needed.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies are required for this project.

# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) game where you try to guess a randomly generated number. The game provides hints to guide you until you guess the correct number.

## Main Functions

- **Random Number Generation**: The game generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- **User Interaction**: You will be prompted to guess the number, and the game will provide feedback whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Hints**: After each guess, the game will tell you if the correct number is higher or lower than your guess.
- **Winning Condition**: The game ends when you correctly guess the number.

## Installation
