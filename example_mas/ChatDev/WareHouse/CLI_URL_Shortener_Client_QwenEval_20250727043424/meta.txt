Task:
Develop a CLI client for a URL shortening service (e.g., TinyURL API or similar). The user provides a long URL, and the tool outputs the shortened URL.

Roster:
Chief Executive Officer, Counselor, Chief Human Resource Officer, Chief Product Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Programmer, Code Reviewer, Software Test Engineer, Chief Creative Officer

Modality:
### step 1: define requirements
first, we need to define the requirements for the cli client here are some key points to consider:
- **input:** a long url provided by the user
- **output:** a shortened url
- **api integration:** we need to integrate with a url shortening service api (eg, tinyurl api)
- **error handling:** handle potential errors such as invalid urls or api failures
- **user interface:** simple and intuitive command-line interface
- **configuration:** allow users to configure api keys or other settings if necessary

### step 2: choose a programming language
for a cli tool, python is a great choice due to its simplicity and powerful libraries for http requests and command-line interfaces

### step 3: design the cli tool
we'll use the `argparse` library to handle command-line arguments and the `requests` library to make http requests to the url shortening service

### step 4: implement the solution
let's start by writing the code we'll use tinyurl as our url shortening service for this example

here's a basic implementation:

```python
import argparse
import requests

def shorten_url(long_url):
    """shorten a url using the tinyurl api"""
    api_url = "https://tinyurlcom/api-createphp"
    params = {'url': long_url}
    try:
        response = requestsget(api_url, params=params)
        responseraise_for_status()  # raise an error for bad responses
        return responsetext
    except requestsexceptionsrequestexception as e:
        return f"error: {e}"

def main():
    parser = argparseargumentparser(description="shorten a url using tinyurl")
    parseradd_argument("url", type=str, help="the long url to shorten")
    args = parserparse_args()

    long_url = argsurl
    shortened_url = shorten_url(long_url)
    print(f"shortened url: {shortened_url}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### step 5: testing
test the cli tool with various urls to ensure it works as expected you can run the script from the command line like this:

```bash
python cli_shortenerpy https://wwwexamplecom
```

### step 6: error handling and improvements
add more robust error handling and user feedback consider adding features like:
- configuration files for api keys
- support for different url shortening services
- logging for debugging purposes

### step 7: documentation
provide clear documentation on how to install and use the cli tool, including examples and troubleshooting tips

### step 8: deployment
package the cli tool for distribution you can use tools like `setuptools` to create a python package that can be installed via `pip`

would you like to proceed with this plan, or do you have any specific instructions or requirements you'd like to add?
