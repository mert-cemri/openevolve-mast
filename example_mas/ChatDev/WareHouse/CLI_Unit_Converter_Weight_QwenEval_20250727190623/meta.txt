Ideas:


Language:
 1. **Readability and Ease of Use**: Python is renowned for its readability and simplicity, making it an excellent choice for rapid development and maintenance. This is particularly important for a small utility like a CLI unit converter.
2. **Performance**: While Python is not the fastest language, the performance difference for a simple unit converter is negligible. The conversion logic is straightforward and doesn't require high-performance computing.
3. **Portability**: Python is highly portable and runs on almost all platforms without modification. This is a significant advantage for a CLI tool that needs to be used across different operating systems.
4. **Community Support**: Python has a large and active community, which means there are plenty of resources, tutorials, and libraries available to help with development and troubleshooting.

Given these considerations, Python remains the best choice for this task.
