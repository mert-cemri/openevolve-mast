Language:
 Given the task requirements and the considerations discussed, Python is indeed the best choice for developing this CLI tool. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Simplicity and Readability**: Python's syntax is clean and easy to understand, making it ideal for rapid development.
2. **Extensive Standard Library**: Python provides modules like `os`, `subprocess`, and `platform` which are perfect for interacting with system files and executing shell commands.
3. **Cross-Platform**: Python's cross-platform capabilities ensure that the tool can be developed and run on various Linux distributions without modification.
4. **Robustness and Maintainability**: Python's robustness and maintainability make it a better choice compared to Bash scripts, especially for more complex tasks in the future.

Considering all these points, the best programming language for this task is:
