[INST: What is the purpose of the manual.md file?]  The manual.md file is a detailed user manual that provides instructions on how to use the software, including introducing main functions of the software, how to install environment dependencies, and how to use/play it. It is intended to be a comprehensive guide for users who are new to the software or who want to learn more about how to use it effectively.

[INST: What is the purpose of the requirements.txt file?]  The requirements.txt file is a list of dependencies required to run the software. It specifies the versions of the dependencies that are required to run the software, and it is used by the package manager to install the dependencies. The requirements.txt file is typically included in the software distribution, and it is used by developers to ensure that the software can be run on any system with the required dependencies installed.

[INST: What is the purpose of the event.py file?]  The event.py file is a Python script that defines a class called Event, which is used to represent an event that occurs in the software. The Event class has two attributes: path, which is the path to the file or directory that the event occurred in, and type, which is the type of event that occurred (e.g., creation, modification, deletion). The Event class is used by the FileWatcher class to represent events that occur in the file system.

[INST: What is the purpose of the watcher.py file?]  The watcher.py file is a Python script that defines a class called FileWatcher, which is used to monitor a file or directory for changes (creation, modification, deletion). The FileWatcher class has several methods, including start(), which starts the file watcher, watch(), which monitors the file or directory for changes, and stop(), which stops the file watcher. The FileWatcher class is used by the main.py script to monitor the specified file or directory for changes.

[INST: What is the purpose of the main.py file?]  The main.py file is a Python script that defines the main entry point for the software. It imports the necessary modules and defines the main function, which is the entry point for the software. The main function takes a path to a file or directory as an argument, and it starts the file watcher by calling the start() method of the FileWatcher class. The main function then enters a loop that waits for events to occur in the file system, and it prints a notification to the console when an event occurs.

[INST: What is the purpose of the requirements.txt file?]  The requirements.txt file is a list of dependencies required to run the software. It specifies the versions of the dependencies that are required to run the software, and it is used by the package manager to install the dependencies. The requirements.txt file is typically included in the software distribution, and it is used by developers to ensure that the software can be run on any system with the required dependencies installed.
