Given the task of building a simple CLI chat client for a local network, the product modality should align with the nature of the task. The task requires a functional application that can send and receive text messages over a network. Considering our previous product modalities, an "Application" seems to be the most suitable choice as it involves implementing software or tools, which fits the requirement of developing a chat client. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. The task requires developing a functional tool that can operate over a network, which aligns well with the "Application" modality. This modality allows us to create a software solution that can handle the necessary functionalities of sending and receiving messages. Therefore, I support the choice of "Application" as the product modality for this task.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Build a simple CLI chat client for a local network. Connects to a corresponding chat server. Allows sending and receiving text messages.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

Here is a new customer's task: Build a simple CLI chat client for a local network. Connects to a corresponding chat server. Allows sending and receiving text messages..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To build a simple CLI chat client for a local network using Python, we will create a client application that connects to a chat server. The client will allow users to send and receive text messages. Since the task specifies a CLI (Command Line Interface) rather than a GUI, we will focus on creating a text-based interface.

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **ChatClient**: 
   - Purpose: Manages the connection to the chat server and handles sending and receiving messages.
   - Methods:
     - `connect_to_server()`: Establishes a connection to the chat server.
     - `send_message(message)`: Sends a message to the server.
     - `receive_messages()`: Listens for incoming messages from the server.
     - `run()`: Main loop to handle user input and display messages.

2. **main()**:
   - Purpose: Entry point of the application. Initializes the client and starts the chat session.

### File Structure

1. **client.py**: Contains the main logic for the chat client.

Let's proceed with the implementation:

#### client.py

```python
'''

client.py

'''

import socket
import threading

class ChatClient:
    '''

                    break
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error receiving message: {e}")
                break

    def run(self):
        '''
        Main loop to handle user input and display messages.
        '''
        self.connect_to_server()
        threading.Thread(target=self.receive_messages, daemon=True).start()
        
        while True:
            message = input("You: ")
            if message.lower() == 'exit':
                print("Exiting chat...")
                self.client_socket.close()
                break
            self.send_message(message)

def main():
    '''
    Entry point of the application. Initializes the client and starts the chat session.
    '''
    client = ChatClient()
    client.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

- **ChatClient**: This class manages the connection to the server and handles sending and receiving messages. It uses a separate thread to listen for incoming messages so that the main thread can handle user input.
- **main()**: Initializes the `ChatClient` and starts the chat session. The user can type messages to send to the server, and incoming messages are displayed in real-time.

This implementation assumes that a corresponding chat server is running and listening on the specified host and port. The client connects to this server and allows users to send and receive messages.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the task requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the handling of server disconnection in the `receive_messages` method. If the server disconnects, the client will print "Disconnected from server." and break out of the loop, but the socket is not properly closed, which could lead to resource leaks.

**Comment with the highest priority:**
Ensure that the client socket is properly closed when the server disconnects to prevent resource leaks.

**Suggestion on revision:**
Modify the `receive_messages` method to close the client socket when the server disconnects.

```python
def receive_messages(self):
    '''
    Listens for incoming messages from the server.
    '''
    try:
        while True:
            message = self.client_socket.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')
            if message:
                print(f"\n{message}")
            else:
                print("Disconnected from server.")
                break
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error receiving message: {e}")
    finally:
        self.client_socket.close()
```

This change ensures that the socket is closed properly when the server disconnects or an error occurs during message reception.

In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Build a simple CLI chat client for a local network. Connects to a corresponding chat server. Allows sending and receiving text messages..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code is mostly well-structured and meets the requirements for a simple CLI chat client. However, there is a potential issue with the way the client handles server disconnections. If the server disconnects or the connection is lost, the client will print "Disconnected from server." and break out of the loop in `receive_messages`, but it does not handle reconnection attempts or gracefully shut down the client. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the user tries to send a message after disconnection.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
1. Implement a mechanism to handle reconnection attempts or notify the user more explicitly about the disconnection and terminate the client gracefully.
2. Ensure that the client does not attempt to send messages if the connection is lost.

Here's a possible revision for the `receive_messages` method:

```python
def receive_messages(self):
    '''
    Listens for incoming messages from the server.
    '''
    try:
        while True:
            message = self.client_socket.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')
            if message:
                print(f"\n{message}")
            else:
                print("Disconnected from server.")
                break
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error receiving message: {e}")
    finally:
        print("Closing connection...")
        self.client_socket.close()
        print("Client terminated. Please restart to reconnect.")
```

Additionally, modify the `run` method to handle the case when the connection is lost:

```python
def run(self):
    '''
    Main loop to handle user input and display messages.
    '''
    self.connect_to_server()
    threading.Thread(target=self.receive_messages, daemon=True).start()
    while True:
        message = input("You: ")
        if message.lower() == 'exit':
            print("Exiting chat...")
            self.client_socket.close()
            break
        try:
            self.send_message(message)
        except Exception as e:
            print("Cannot send message. Connection might be lost.")
            break
```

These changes will ensure that the client handles disconnections more gracefully and informs the user appropriately.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is mostly well-structured and meets the requirements for a simple CLI chat client. However, there is a potential issue with the way the client handles server disconnections. If the server disconnects or the connection is lost, the client will print "Disconnected from server." and break out of the loop in `receive_messages`, but it does not handle reconnection attempts or gracefully shut down the client. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the user tries to send a message after disconnection.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
1. Implement a mechanism to handle reconnection attempts or notify the user more explicitly about the disconnection and terminate the client gracefully.
2. Ensure that the client does not attempt to send messages if the connection is lost.

Here's a possible revision for the `receive_messages` method:

```python
def receive_messages(self):
    '''
    Listens for incoming messages from the server.
    '''
    try:
        while True:
            message = self.client_socket.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')
            if message:
                print(f"\n{message}")
            else:
                print("Disconnected from server.")
                break
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error receiving message: {e}")
    finally:
        print("Closing connection...")
        self.client_socket.close()
        print("Client terminated. Please restart to reconnect.")
```

Additionally, modify the `run` method to handle the case when the connection is lost:

```python
def run(self):
    '''
    Main loop to handle user input and display messages.
    '''
    self.connect_to_server()
    threading.Thread(target=self.receive_messages, daemon=True).start()
    while True:
        message = input("You: ")
        if message.lower() == 'exit':
            print("Exiting chat...")
            self.client_socket.close()
            break
        try:
            self.send_message(message)
        except Exception as e:
            print("Cannot send message. Connection might be lost.")
            break
```

These changes will ensure that the client handles disconnections more gracefully and informs the user appropriately."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

This could lead to unexpected behavior if the user tries to send a message after disconnection.\n\nSuggestion for Revision:\n1. Implement a mechanism to handle reconnection attempts or notify the user more explicitly about the disconnection and terminate the client gracefully.\n2.

Please restart to reconnect.")\n\n\nAdditionally, modify the run method to handle the case when the connection is lost:\n\npython\ndef run(self):\n    \'\'\'\n    Main loop to handle user input and display messages.\n    \'\'\'\n    self.connect_to_server()\n    threading.Thread(target=self.receive_messages, daemon=True).start()\n    while True:\n        message = input("You: ")\n        if message.lower() == \'exit\':\n            print("Exiting chat...")\n            self.client_socket.close()\n            break\n        try:\n            self.send_message(message)\n        except Exception as e:\n            print("Cannot send message.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly functional and adheres to the task requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the handling of the client socket closure, which can lead to unhandled exceptions if the server disconnects unexpectedly. This is a critical aspect to ensure robustness and user experience.

**Comment with the highest priority:**
The `receive_messages` method does not handle the scenario where the server disconnects unexpectedly, which can lead to an unhandled exception and abrupt termination of the client. Additionally, the `send_message` method should handle the case where the socket is already closed.

**Suggestions on revision:**
1. Modify the `receive_messages` method to handle the case where the server disconnects unexpectedly by checking if the received message is empty and then breaking the loop gracefully.
2. Ensure that the `send_message` method checks if the socket is still connected before attempting to send a message.

Here is how you can implement these changes:

```python
def receive_messages(self):
    '''
    Listens for incoming messages from the server.
    '''
    try:
        while True:
            message = self.client_socket.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')
            if message:
                print(f"\n{message}")
            else:
                print("Disconnected from server.")
                break
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error receiving message: {e}")
    finally:
        print("Closing connection...")
        self.client_socket.close()
        print("Client terminated. Please restart to reconnect.")

def send_message(self, message):
    '''

[2025-13-05 11:52:42 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 The code provided is mostly functional and adheres to the task requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the handling of the client socket closure, which can lead to unhandled exceptions if the server disconnects unexpectedly. This is a critical aspect to ensure robustness and user experience.

**Comment with the highest priority:**
The `receive_messages` method does not handle the scenario where the server disconnects unexpectedly, which can lead to an unhandled exception and abrupt termination of the client. Additionally, the `send_message` method should handle the case where the socket is already closed.

**Suggestions on revision:**
1. Modify the `receive_messages` method to handle the case where the server disconnects unexpectedly by checking if the received message is empty and then breaking the loop gracefully.
2. Ensure that the `send_message` method checks if the socket is still connected before attempting to send a message.

Here is how you can implement these changes:

```python
def receive_messages(self):
    '''
    Listens for incoming messages from the server.
    '''
    try:
        while True:
            message = self.client_socket.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')
            if message:
                print(f"\n{message}")
            else:
                print("Disconnected from server.")
                break
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error receiving message: {e}")
    finally:
        print("Closing connection...")
        self.client_socket.close()
        print("Client terminated. Please restart to reconnect.")

def send_message(self, message):
    '''
    Sends a message to the chat server.
    '''
    try:
        if self.client_socket:
            self.client_socket.sendall(message.encode('utf-8'))
        else:
            print("Cannot send message. Connection is closed.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error sending message: {e}")
```

These changes will help ensure that the client handles disconnections gracefully and provides a better user experience.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is mostly functional and adheres to the task requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the handling of the client socket closure, which can lead to unhandled exceptions if the server disconnects unexpectedly. This is a critical aspect to ensure robustness and user experience.

**Comment with the highest priority:**
The `receive_messages` method does not handle the scenario where the server disconnects unexpectedly, which can lead to an unhandled exception and abrupt termination of the client. Additionally, the `send_message` method should handle the case where the socket is already closed.

**Suggestions on revision:**
1. Modify the `receive_messages` method to handle the case where the server disconnects unexpectedly by checking if the received message is empty and then breaking the loop gracefully.
2. Ensure that the `send_message` method checks if the socket is still connected before attempting to send a message.

Here is how you can implement these changes:

```python
def receive_messages(self):
    '''
    Listens for incoming messages from the server.
    '''
    try:
        while True:
            message = self.client_socket.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')
            if message:
                print(f"\n{message}")
            else:
                print("Disconnected from server.")
                break
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error receiving message: {e}")
    finally:
        print("Closing connection...")
        self.client_socket.close()
        print("Client terminated. Please restart to reconnect.")

def send_message(self, message):
    '''
    Sends a message to the chat server.
    '''
    try:
        if self.client_socket:
            self.client_socket.sendall(message.encode('utf-8'))
        else:
            print("Cannot send message. Connection is closed.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error sending message: {e}")
```

These changes will help ensure that the client handles disconnections gracefully and provides a better user experience."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Build a simple CLI chat client for a local network. Connects to a corresponding chat server. Allows sending and receiving text messages..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Build a simple CLI chat client for a local network. Connects to a corresponding chat server. Allows sending and receiving text messages..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error message you provided indicates a `NameError` in the `main.py` file, specifically stating that the name 'ChatClient' is not defined. This error occurs because the `ChatClient` class is defined in a separate file, `client.py`, and it has not been imported into `main.py`. 

To resolve this issue, you need to import the `ChatClient` class from `client.py` into `main.py`. Here's how you can fix it:

1. Open `main.py`.
2. Add an import statement at the top of the file to import the `ChatClient` class from `client.py`.

Here is the corrected `main.py`:

```python
'''
Entry point of the application. Initializes the client and starts the chat session.
'''
from client import ChatClient  # Import the ChatClient class

def main():
    client = ChatClient()
    client.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

By adding `from client import ChatClient`, you ensure that the `ChatClient` class is available in `main.py`, allowing the script to create an instance of `ChatClient` and run the chat client without encountering a `NameError`.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Build a simple CLI chat client for a local network. Connects to a corresponding chat server. Allows sending and receiving text messages..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error message in the test report indicates a `NameError: name 'ChatClient' is not defined`. This error occurs because the `ChatClient` class is not recognized in the `main.py` file. This is likely due to the fact that `ChatClient` is defined in a separate file, `client.py`, and has not been imported into `main.py`.

To resolve this issue, you need to import the `ChatClient` class from the `client.py` file into `main.py`. Here's how you can fix it:

1. Open `main.py`.
2. Add an import statement at the top of the file to import the `ChatClient` class from `client.py`.

Here is the corrected `main.py`:

```python
'''
Entry point of the application. Initializes the client and starts the chat session.
'''
from client import ChatClient  # Import the ChatClient class

def main():
    client = ChatClient()
    client.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

By adding `from client import ChatClient`, you ensure that the `ChatClient` class is available in `main.py`, allowing the script to create an instance of `ChatClient` and run the chat client without encountering the `NameError`.

Test Reports of Source Codes:
"Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 8, in <module>
    main()
  File "main.py", line 5, in main
    client = ChatClient()
NameError: name 'ChatClient' is not defined
"
Error Summary of Test Reports:
"The error message in the test report indicates a `NameError: name 'ChatClient' is not defined`. This error occurs because the `ChatClient` class is not recognized in the `main.py` file. This is likely due to the fact that `ChatClient` is defined in a separate file, `client.py`, and has not been imported into `main.py`.

To resolve this issue, you need to import the `ChatClient` class from the `client.py` file into `main.py`. Here's how you can fix it:

1. Open `main.py`.
2. Add an import statement at the top of the file to import the `ChatClient` class from `client.py`.

Here is the corrected `main.py`:

```python
'''
Entry point of the application. Initializes the client and starts the chat session.
'''
from client import ChatClient  # Import the ChatClient class

def main():
    client = ChatClient()
    client.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

By adding `from client import ChatClient`, you ensure that the `ChatClient` class is available in `main.py`, allowing the script to create an instance of `ChatClient` and run the chat client without encountering the `NameError`."
Note that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary. Now, use the format exemplified above and modify the problematic codes based on the error summary. Output the codes that you fixed based on the test reported and corresponding explanations (strictly follow the format defined above, including FILENAME, LANGUAGE, DOCSTRING and CODE; incomplete "TODO" codes are strictly prohibited). If no bugs are reported, please return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Build a simple CLI chat client for a local network. Connects to a corresponding chat server. Allows sending and receiving text messages..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code, the project primarily uses Python's standard library modules, such as `socket` and `threading`, which do not require additional installation via `pip`. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be minimal. However, if you plan to expand the project or use additional libraries in the future, you can update this file accordingly.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file for the current project:

```
# No external dependencies are required for this project as it uses Python's standard library.
```

If you decide to add features that require external libraries, you can list them in this file with their respective versions. For now, this file serves as a placeholder to indicate that no additional packages are needed.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

```markdown
# Simple CLI Chat Client

A simple command-line interface (CLI) chat client for connecting to a chat server over a local network. This application allows users to send and receive text messages in real-time.

## Main Functions

- **Connect to Server**: Establishes a connection to a chat server running on a specified host and port.
- **Send Messages**: Allows users to send text messages to the connected chat server.
- **Receive Messages**: Continuously listens for incoming messages from the server and displays them to the user.
- **Exit Chat**: Users can exit the chat session by typing 'exit'.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the source code to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Python**: Make sure Python is installed. You can verify the installation by running:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: This project does not require any external dependencies as it uses Python's standard library. However, ensure your Python environment is set up correctly.

## How to Use

1. **Start the Chat Server**: Before running the client, ensure that a chat server is running on the network. The server should be listening on the same host and port specified in the `client.py` file (default is `localhost:12345`).

2. **Run the Chat Client**: Execute the `main.py` script to start the chat client.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Send and Receive Messages**: Once connected, you can start typing messages. Press `Enter` to send a message. Incoming messages from other users will be displayed in real-time.

4. **Exit the Chat**: To leave the chat session, type `exit` and press `Enter`. This will close the connection and terminate the client.

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues**: If you encounter a "Failed to connect to server" error, ensure that the server is running and accessible on the specified host and port.
- **Message Sending/Receiving Issues**: If messages are not being sent or received, check your network connection and ensure the server is functioning correctly.

## Additional Information

This chat client is designed for educational purposes and local network use. For production use, consider implementing additional features such as authentication, encryption, and error handling.

For further assistance or to report issues, please contact our support team.
