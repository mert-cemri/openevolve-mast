I understand the new customer's request and the existing product portfolio of ChatDev. Based on the information provided, I suggest we focus on developing a CLI clipboard manager that can handle text-only content. This product modality would allow users to easily manage their clipboard history and access their previously copied text from the command line.

To achieve this, we can use a combination of Python and the pyperclip library to interact with the system clipboard. We can also use the prompt_toolkit library to create a user-friendly command-line interface.

By implementing this product modality, we can provide a convenient and efficient way for users to manage their clipboard history and access their previously copied text from the command line. This would be a valuable addition to the existing product portfolio of ChatDev and meet the needs of the new customer.

Let's discuss and decide on this product modality. Once we have reached a consensus, I will terminate the discussion by replying with "<INFO> CLI Clipboard Manager".
