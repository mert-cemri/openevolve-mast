I understand the new customer's demand and the product should be realizable. As the Chief Product Officer, I suggest we discuss the product modality to satisfy the customer's demand.

Let's discuss the product modality and decide which one do we want the product to be. We can discuss the following product modalities:

1. CLI regex tester: a command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows users to test regular expressions (regex) against test strings and display matched groups.
2. Web-based regex tester: a web-based tool that allows users to test regex against test strings and display matched groups.
3. Desktop application: a desktop application that allows users to test regex against test strings and display matched groups.

Let's discuss and decide on the product modality that best satisfies the customer's demand and our company's capabilities. Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> CLI regex tester".
