Language:
 The task is to create a CLI Hangman game, which involves:
1. Selecting a random word.
2. Allowing the user to guess letters.
3. Displaying the word with guessed letters filled in.
4. Tracking incorrect guesses.

Given these requirements, we need a language that:
- Is easy to read and write.
- Has good support for string manipulation.
- Can handle user input efficiently.

Python is indeed a great choice for this task. It is known for its simplicity and readability, making it an excellent choice for beginners and for writing small to medium-sized applications like this one. Python's built-in support for string manipulation and its `input()` function for handling user input are perfect for this task. Additionally, Python's `random` module can be used to select a random word from a list, which is exactly what we need.

Considering these points, Python is indeed the best choice for implementing this CLI Hangman game.
