Given the requirements for a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, it seems that an "Application" would be the most suitable product modality. This would allow us to create an interactive and visualized game experience for users, which aligns with the customer's request for a two-player game with a standard 3x3 grid. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree that an "Application" would be the most appropriate modality for this task. It allows us to create an interactive and engaging experience for the users, which is essential for a game like tic-tac-toe. Additionally, an application can effectively handle the logic for alternating turns, tracking moves, and determining the winner, providing a seamless user experience. Let's proceed with this modality.

To design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface using Python, we'll break down the task into several components. We'll use the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface (GUI). Here are the core classes and functions that will be necessary:

1. **TicTacToeGame**: This class will manage the game logic, including the game board, player turns, and determining the winner.

2. **TicTacToeGUI**: This class will handle the graphical user interface, displaying the game board and handling user interactions.

3. **main**: The main function will initialize the game and start the GUI loop.

Now, let's implement the code for each file.

### main.py

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner. Use a standard 3x3 grid, track each player's moves. Players alternate placing X or O, and the game ends when a player wins or the board is full..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The code is mostly well-structured and functional, but there is a minor issue with the user interface logic that could affect user experience. When a player wins or the game ends in a draw, the buttons should be disabled to prevent further moves until the game is restarted. This is not currently implemented, which could lead to confusion as players can still click on the board after the game has ended.

To fix this, you should disable all buttons when the game ends and re-enable them when the game is restarted. Here's how you can implement this:

1. In the `show_winner` method of `TicTacToeGUI`, add a loop to disable all buttons after displaying the winner or draw message.

```python
def show_winner(self, winner):
    winner_text = f"{winner} wins!" if winner != "No one" else "It's a draw!"
    result_label = tk.Label(self.root, text=winner_text, font=('Arial', 18))
    result_label.grid(row=3, column=0, columnspan=3)
    restart_button = tk.Button(self.root, text='Restart', command=self.restart_game)
    restart_button.grid(row=4, column=0, columnspan=3)
    # Disable all buttons
    for row in range(3):
        for col in range(3):
            self.buttons[row][col].config(state='disabled')
```

2. In the `restart_game` method, re-enable the buttons when the game is reset.

```python
def restart_game(self):
    self.game.reset()
    for row in range(3):
        for col in range(3):
            self.buttons[row][col].config(text='', state='normal')
    for widget in self.root.grid_slaves():
        if int(widget.grid_info()["row"]) > 2:
            widget.destroy()
```

Implementing these changes will ensure that the game interface behaves as expected and enhances the user experience by preventing invalid actions after the game has concluded.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is mostly well-structured and functional, but there is a minor issue with the user interface logic that could affect user experience. When a player wins or the game ends in a draw, the buttons should be disabled to prevent further moves until the game is restarted. This is not currently implemented, which could lead to confusion as players can still click on the board after the game has ended.

To fix this, you should disable all buttons when the game ends and re-enable them when the game is restarted. Here's how you can implement this:

1. In the `show_winner` method of `TicTacToeGUI`, add a loop to disable all buttons after displaying the winner or draw message.

```python
def show_winner(self, winner):
    winner_text = f"{winner} wins!" if winner != "No one" else "It's a draw!"
    result_label = tk.Label(self.root, text=winner_text, font=('Arial', 18))
    result_label.grid(row=3, column=0, columnspan=3)
    restart_button = tk.Button(self.root, text='Restart', command=self.restart_game)
    restart_button.grid(row=4, column=0, columnspan=3)
    # Disable all buttons
    for row in range(3):
        for col in range(3):
            self.buttons[row][col].config(state='disabled')
```

2. In the `restart_game` method, re-enable the buttons when the game is reset.

```python
def restart_game(self):
    self.game.reset()
    for row in range(3):
        for col in range(3):
            self.buttons[row][col].config(text='', state='normal')
    for widget in self.root.grid_slaves():
        if int(widget.grid_info()["row"]) > 2:
            widget.destroy()
```

Implementing these changes will ensure that the game interface behaves as expected and enhances the user experience by preventing invalid actions after the game has concluded."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Software Test Engineer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to design and execute tests to ensure the quality and functionality of software products. You develop test plans, create test cases, and report on software performance. You identify defects and collaborate with the development team to resolve them.
You need to ensure that the software is working as expected and meets the customer's requirements.
Check the edge cases and special cases and instances for the task we are doing. Do not miss any cases. Do not suffice with generic and superficial cases.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with programmers and code reviewers.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner. Use a standard 3x3 grid, track each player's moves. Players alternate placing X or O, and the game ends when a player wins or the board is full..
To complete the task, you will design and implement test procedures, report issues found, and verify that the software meets the customer's requirements.]

The error message you encountered is related to the graphical user interface (GUI) component of the Tic-Tac-Toe game, specifically when trying to initialize the Tkinter root window. The error message is:

```
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error typically occurs when attempting to run a Tkinter-based GUI application in an environment that does not have access to a graphical display server. This is common when running the application on a headless server or in an environment without a graphical user interface, such as a remote server accessed via SSH without X11 forwarding.

Here are the key points to address this issue:

1. **Environment Configuration**: Ensure that the environment where you are running the application has access to a display server. If you are running this on a local machine with a GUI, this error should not occur. However, if you are running it on a remote server, you may need to set up X11 forwarding or use a virtual display server like Xvfb.

2. **X11 Forwarding**: If you are accessing a remote server via SSH, you can enable X11 forwarding by using the `-X` or `-Y` option with the SSH command:
   ```
   ssh -X user@remote-server
   ```
   This will forward the display from the remote server to your local machine.

3. **Virtual Display**: If X11 forwarding is not an option, you can use a virtual display server like Xvfb to create a virtual framebuffer that Tkinter can use. You can start Xvfb and set the `DISPLAY` environment variable before running your application:
   ```
   Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x16 &
   export DISPLAY=:99
   python main.py
   ```

By addressing the environment configuration, you should be able to run the Tkinter-based Tic-Tac-Toe game without encountering the `TclError`.

Error Summary of Test Reports:
"The error message you encountered is related to the graphical user interface (GUI) component of the Tic-Tac-Toe game, specifically when trying to initialize the Tkinter root window. The error message is:

```
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error typically occurs when attempting to run a Tkinter-based GUI application in an environment that does not have access to a graphical display server. This is common when running the application on a headless server or in an environment without a graphical user interface, such as a remote server accessed via SSH without X11 forwarding.

Here are the key points to address this issue:

1. **Environment Configuration**: Ensure that the environment where you are running the application has access to a display server. If you are running this on a local machine with a GUI, this error should not occur. However, if you are running it on a remote server, you may need to set up X11 forwarding or use a virtual display server like Xvfb.

2. **X11 Forwarding**: If you are accessing a remote server via SSH, you can enable X11 forwarding by using the `-X` or `-Y` option with the SSH command:
   ```
   ssh -X user@remote-server
   ```
   This will forward the display from the remote server to your local machine.

3. **Virtual Display**: If X11 forwarding is not an option, you can use a virtual display server like Xvfb to create a virtual framebuffer that Tkinter can use. You can start Xvfb and set the `DISPLAY` environment variable before running your application:
   ```
   Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x16 &
   export DISPLAY=:99
   python main.py
   ```

By addressing the environment configuration, you should be able to run the Tkinter-based Tic-Tac-Toe game without encountering the `TclError`."
Note that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Software Test Engineer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to design and execute tests to ensure the quality and functionality of software products. You develop test plans, create test cases, and report on software performance. You identify defects and collaborate with the development team to resolve them.
You need to ensure that the software is working as expected and meets the customer's requirements.
Check the edge cases and special cases and instances for the task we are doing. Do not miss any cases. Do not suffice with generic and superficial cases.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with programmers and code reviewers.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner. Use a standard 3x3 grid, track each player's moves. Players alternate placing X or O, and the game ends when a player wins or the board is full..
To complete the task, you will design and implement test procedures, report issues found, and verify that the software meets the customer's requirements.]

The error message you encountered is related to the graphical user interface (GUI) of the Tic-Tac-Toe game, specifically when trying to initialize the Tkinter root window. The error message is:

```
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error typically occurs when you attempt to run a Tkinter-based GUI application in an environment that does not have access to a display server. This is common when running the application on a headless server or in an environment without a graphical user interface, such as a remote server accessed via SSH without X11 forwarding.

Here is a summary of the issue:

1. **Environment Issue**: The error indicates that the Tkinter library is trying to create a window, but it cannot find a display to connect to. This is because the `$DISPLAY` environment variable, which tells GUI applications where to render their windows, is not set.

2. **Headless Environment**: This problem often arises in headless environments, where there is no graphical display available. This includes running the application on a server or in a Docker container without GUI support.

To resolve this issue, you have a few options:

- **Run Locally**: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical display.

- **Use X11 Forwarding**: If you are accessing a remote server via SSH, you can enable X11 forwarding by using the `-X` or `-Y` option with the SSH command (e.g., `ssh -X user@server`). This will allow GUI applications to display on your local machine.

- **Virtual Display**: Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to simulate a display environment. This is useful for running GUI applications in headless environments.

- **Modify the Application**: If the GUI is not essential for your testing, you could modify the application to run in a non-GUI mode for testing purposes.

By addressing the environment issue, you should be able to run the Tkinter-based Tic-Tac-Toe game without encountering the `TclError`.

Error Summary of Test Reports:
"The error message you encountered is related to the graphical user interface (GUI) of the Tic-Tac-Toe game, specifically when trying to initialize the Tkinter root window. The error message is:

```
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error typically occurs when you attempt to run a Tkinter-based GUI application in an environment that does not have access to a display server. This is common when running the application on a headless server or in an environment without a graphical user interface, such as a remote server accessed via SSH without X11 forwarding.

Here is a summary of the issue:

1. **Environment Issue**: The error indicates that the Tkinter library is trying to create a window, but it cannot find a display to connect to. This is because the `$DISPLAY` environment variable, which tells GUI applications where to render their windows, is not set.

2. **Headless Environment**: This problem often arises in headless environments, where there is no graphical display available. This includes running the application on a server or in a Docker container without GUI support.

To resolve this issue, you have a few options:

- **Run Locally**: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical display.

- **Use X11 Forwarding**: If you are accessing a remote server via SSH, you can enable X11 forwarding by using the `-X` or `-Y` option with the SSH command (e.g., `ssh -X user@server`). This will allow GUI applications to display on your local machine.

- **Virtual Display**: Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to simulate a display environment. This is useful for running GUI applications in headless environments.

- **Modify the Application**: If the GUI is not essential for your testing, you could modify the application to run in a non-GUI mode for testing purposes.

By addressing the environment issue, you should be able to run the Tkinter-based Tic-Tac-Toe game without encountering the `TclError`."
Note that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary. Now, use the format exemplified above and modify the problematic codes based on the error summary. Output the codes that you fixed based on the test reported and corresponding explanations (strictly follow the format defined above, including FILENAME, LANGUAGE, DOCSTRING and CODE; incomplete "TODO" codes are strictly prohibited). If no bugs are reported, please return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Software Test Engineer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to design and execute tests to ensure the quality and functionality of software products. You develop test plans, create test cases, and report on software performance. You identify defects and collaborate with the development team to resolve them.
You need to ensure that the software is working as expected and meets the customer's requirements.
Check the edge cases and special cases and instances for the task we are doing. Do not miss any cases. Do not suffice with generic and superficial cases.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with programmers and code reviewers.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner. Use a standard 3x3 grid, track each player's moves. Players alternate placing X or O, and the game ends when a player wins or the board is full..
To complete the task, you will design and implement test procedures, report issues found, and verify that the software meets the customer's requirements.]

The error message is:\n\n\n_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable\n\n\nThis error typically occurs when you attempt to run a Tkinter-based GUI application in an environment that does not have access to a display server. This is common when running the application on a headless server or in an environment without a graphical user interface, such as a remote server accessed via SSH without X11 forwarding.\n\nHere is a summary of the issue:\n\n1. Environment Issue: The error indicates that the Tkinter library is trying to create a window, but it cannot find a display to connect to. This is because the $DISPLAY environment variable, which tells GUI applications where to render their windows, is not set.\n\n2. Headless Environment: This problem often arises in headless environments, where there is no graphical display available. This includes running the application on a server or in a Docker container without GUI support.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you have a few options:\n\n- Run Locally: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical display.\n\n- Use X11 Forwarding: If you are accessing a remote server via SSH, you can enable X11 forwarding by using the -X or -Y option with the SSH command (e.g., ssh -X user@server). This will allow GUI applications to display on your local machine.\n\n- Virtual Display: Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to simulate a display environment. This is useful for running GUI applications in headless environments.\n\n- Modify the Application: If the GUI is not essential for your testing, you could modify the application to run in a non-GUI mode for testing purposes.\n\nBy addressing the environment issue, you should be able to run the Tkinter-based Tic-Tac-Toe game without encountering the TclError.'} |

_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error occurs because the Tkinter library requires a display environment to render the GUI, and it cannot find the `$DISPLAY` environment variable, which is typically set in environments with a graphical user interface.

In the provided code, there is an attempt to handle this situation in the `tictactoegui.py` file by checking for the `DISPLAY` environment variable and setting it to `':0'` if it is not present. However, this approach may not work if there is no actual display server running on `:0`.

To resolve this issue, you can use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to simulate a display environment. This can be done by starting Xvfb before running the application or by using a library like `pyvirtualdisplay` to manage the virtual display programmatically within the Python script.

[2025-31-03 16:17:23 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 The error traceback indicates that the issue arises when attempting to initialize the Tkinter GUI in a headless environment, which lacks a display server. This is a common problem when running GUI applications on systems without a graphical interface, such as remote servers or CI/CD pipelines.

Error Summary of Test Reports:
"The error traceback indicates that the issue arises when attempting to initialize the Tkinter GUI in a headless environment, which lacks a display server. This is a common problem when running GUI applications on systems without a graphical interface, such as remote servers or CI/CD pipelines.

The specific error message is:
```
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error occurs because the Tkinter library requires a display environment to render the GUI, and it cannot find the `$DISPLAY` environment variable, which is typically set in environments with a graphical user interface.

In the provided code, there is an attempt to handle this situation in the `tictactoegui.py` file by checking for the `DISPLAY` environment variable and setting it to `':0'` if it is not present. However, this approach may not work if there is no actual display server running on `:0`.

To resolve this issue, you can use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to simulate a display environment. This can be done by starting Xvfb before running the application or by using a library like `pyvirtualdisplay` to manage the virtual display programmatically within the Python script."
Note that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary. Now, use the format exemplified above and modify the problematic codes based on the error summary. Output the codes that you fixed based on the test reported and corresponding explanations (strictly follow the format defined above, including FILENAME, LANGUAGE, DOCSTRING and CODE; incomplete "TODO" codes are strictly prohibited). If no bugs are reported, please return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You are a Software Test Engineer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to design and execute tests to ensure the quality and functionality of software products. You develop test plans, create test cases, and report on software performance. You identify defects and collaborate with the development team to resolve them.
You need to ensure that the software is working as expected and meets the customer's requirements.
Check the edge cases and special cases and instances for the task we are doing. Do not miss any cases. Do not suffice with generic and superficial cases.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with programmers and code reviewers.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner. Use a standard 3x3 grid, track each player's moves. Players alternate placing X or O, and the game ends when a player wins or the board is full..
To complete the task, you will design and implement test procedures, report issues found, and verify that the software meets the customer's requirements.]

To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

Based on the provided code, the primary dependencies for this project are `tkinter` for the graphical user interface and `pyvirtualdisplay` for handling virtual displays in headless environments. However, `tkinter` is a standard library module in Python and does not need to be listed in `requirements.txt`. Here is the `requirements.txt` file for the project:

```
pyvirtualdisplay
```

This file specifies that the project requires the `pyvirtualdisplay` package to run properly. If there are any additional dependencies or specific versions needed, they should be added to this file as well.

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, the primary dependencies for this project are `tkinter` for the graphical user interface and `pyvirtualdisplay` for handling virtual displays in headless environments. However, `tkinter` is a standard library module in Python and does not need to be listed in `requirements.txt`. Here is the `requirements.txt` file for the project:
```
pyvirtualdisplay
```
This file specifies that the project requires the `pyvirtualdisplay` package to run properly. If there are any additional dependencies or specific versions needed, they should be added to this file as well. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are the Counselor at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to provide expert advice and guidance to the team, ensuring that the customer's needs are fully understood and met. You facilitate communication and offer valuable suggestions to improve the project's outcome.
You report to the executive team and collaborate with various departments to align the project with customer expectations.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner. Use a standard 3x3 grid, track each player's moves. Players alternate placing X or O, and the game ends when a player wins or the board is full..
To complete the task, you will analyze the customer's requirements and provide recommendations based on your expertise.]

As the CEO, I appreciate the work done by the Programmer and the CTO. However, I would like to ensure that the solution is comprehensive and meets the customer's requirements effectively. Here are a few strategic points and actions to consider:

1. **Review and Testing**: Ensure that the code has been thoroughly tested for functionality and user experience. The game should be intuitive and responsive.

2. **Documentation**: Besides the `requirements.txt`, consider adding a README file that provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and how to run the game. This will be helpful for users who are not familiar with the project.

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Verify that the game runs smoothly on different operating systems, especially since `tkinter` and `pyvirtualdisplay` might behave differently across platforms.

4. **User Feedback**: Consider implementing a feedback mechanism within the game or after the game ends to gather user insights for future improvements.

5. **Future Enhancements**: Think about potential enhancements, such as adding sound effects, different themes, or an AI opponent for single-player mode.

6. **Security and Privacy**: Ensure that the application adheres to best practices in terms of security and privacy, even for a simple game like Tic-Tac-Toe.

Let's proceed with these considerations in mind to ensure the project aligns with our mission of changing the digital world through programming. If there are no further questions or issues, we can move forward with finalizing and delivering the project to the customer.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

# Tic-Tac-Toe Game User Manual

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game! This user-friendly application allows two players to enjoy the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe on a standard 3x3 grid. Players alternate turns to place their marks (X or O) on the grid, and the game concludes when a player wins or the board is full.

## Main Functions

- **Two-Player Mode**: The game supports two players who take turns to place their marks on the grid.
- **Winner Detection**: The game automatically detects when a player wins by completing a row, column, or diagonal with their marks.
- **Draw Detection**: If the board is full and no player has won, the game declares a draw.
- **Restart Functionality**: Players can restart the game at any time to play again.

## Quick Install

To run the Tic-Tac-Toe game, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, the game uses the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface. Follow the steps below to set up the environment and run the game:

### Step 1: Install Python

Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install Required Dependencies

The game requires the `tkinter` library, which is included with most Python installations. If you encounter any issues, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

For headless environments, the game also uses the `pyvirtualdisplay` library. Install it using:

```bash
pip install pyvirtualdisplay
```

### Step 3: Run the Game

1. Download the game files (`main.py`, `tictactoe_game.py`, `tictactoe_gui.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the game files.
3. Run the game using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Launch the game by running `main.py`. A window will open displaying the 3x3 grid.
2. **Take Turns**: Players take turns clicking on the grid to place their marks (X or O).
3. **Winning the Game**: The game will automatically detect and announce the winner when a player completes a row, column, or diagonal with their marks.
4. **Draw**: If the board is full and no player has won, the game will declare a draw.
5. **Restart**: Click the "Restart" button to reset the game and play again.
