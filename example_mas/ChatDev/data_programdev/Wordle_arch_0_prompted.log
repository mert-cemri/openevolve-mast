Considering the customer's requirement to play the game directly from the Linux Terminal without needing a dedicated UX or GUI platform, the most suitable modality seems to be "Application," specifically implemented via Python.

However, I would like to hear your thoughts on this before finalizing.

I completely agree with your assessment. Given the customer's explicit requirement to play the game directly from the Linux Terminal without a dedicated UX or GUI, the "Application" modality implemented via Python is indeed the most suitable choice. Python applications are highly compatible with Linux terminals and can easily handle text-based interactions, making it ideal for this scenario.

If there are no further objections or alternative suggestions, I suggest we finalize this modality.

Task: "Design a standard wordle game by providing a daily 5-letter English language word. The game should allow a player to take 6 turns to guess the word.

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

### Step 1: Architecture and Components

We will implement the Wordle game using Python. The project will consist of the following files:

1. **main.py**: Entry point of the application. It will handle the game loop, user input, and output.
2. **wordle.py**: Contains the core logic of the game, including word selection, guess validation, and feedback generation.
3. **words.py**: Contains a list of valid 5-letter English words.

---

### Step 2: Classes, Functions, and Methods

#### File: main.py
- `main()`: Entry point of the game. Handles the game loop, user interaction, and displays feedback.

#### File: wordle.py
- Class `WordleGame`:
  - `__init__(self, word_list)`: Initializes the game with a random word from the provided word list.
  - `validate_guess(self, guess)`: Checks if the guess is valid (5-letter English word).
  - `get_feedback(self, guess)`: Returns feedback for the guess (green, yellow, grey).
  - `is_correct_guess(self, guess)`: Checks if the guess matches the target word.

#### File: words.py
- `WORD_LIST`: List of valid 5-letter English words.

---

### Step 3: Implementation of Files

main.py

```python
'''
Main entry point for the Wordle game. Handles user interaction and game loop.

from wordle import WordleGame
from words import WORD_LIST

def main():
    game = WordleGame(WORD_LIST)
    attempts = 6
    print("Welcome to Terminal Wordle!")
    print("You have 6 attempts to guess the 5-letter word.\n")

    for attempt in range(1, attempts + 1):
        while True:
            guess = input(f"Attempt {attempt}/6: ").lower()
            if game.validate_guess(guess):
                break
            else:
                print("Invalid guess. Please enter a valid 5-letter English word.")

        feedback = game.get_feedback(guess)
        print(feedback)

    "queen", "river", "snake", "tiger", "uncle", "vivid", "wheat", "xenon",
    "young", "zebra"
]
```

### Step 4: Running the Game

To run the game, ensure all three files (`main.py`, `wordle.py`, and `words.py`) are in the same directory. Then execute the following command in your Linux terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Explanation of Color Codes:
- Green (`\033[92m`): Correct letter in the correct position.
- Yellow (`\033[93m`): Correct letter in the wrong position.
- Grey (`\033[90m`): Incorrect letter.

This implementation meets all the requirements specified by the user and provides a playable Wordle game directly from the Linux terminal.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Highest Priority Comment:

The file `words.py` is incorrectly implemented. It currently contains only the line `python main.py`, which is not valid Python code. This file should instead contain a Python list named `WORD_LIST` with valid 5-letter English words to be used by the game.

Instructions to Fix:

Replace the current content of `words.py` with a proper Python list of words. For example:

```python
# words.py
'''
List of valid 5-letter English words for the Wordle game.
'''

WORD_LIST = [
    'apple', 'brave', 'crane', 'dwarf', 'eagle', 'flame', 'grape', 
    'house', 'input', 'joker', 'knock', 'lemon', 'mango', 'night', 
    'ocean', 'piano', 'queen', 'river', 'snake', 'table', 'uncle', 
    'vivid', 'wheat', 'xenon', 'young', 'zebra'
]
```

This correction will ensure the game has a valid word list to select from and validate user guesses against, thereby meeting the user's requirements and making the software directly operable.

Comments on Codes:
"Highest Priority Comment:

The file `words.py` is incorrectly implemented. It currently contains only the line `python main.py`, which is not valid Python code. This file should instead contain a Python list named `WORD_LIST` with valid 5-letter English words to be used by the game.

Instructions to Fix:

Replace the current content of `words.py` with a proper Python list of words. For example:

```python
# words.py
'''
List of valid 5-letter English words for the Wordle game.
'''

WORD_LIST = [
    'apple', 'brave', 'crane', 'dwarf', 'eagle', 'flame', 'grape', 
    'house', 'input', 'joker', 'knock', 'lemon', 'mango', 'night', 
    'ocean', 'piano', 'queen', 'river', 'snake', 'table', 'uncle', 
    'vivid', 'wheat', 'xenon', 'young', 'zebra'
]
```

This correction will ensure the game has a valid word list to select from and validate user guesses against, thereby meeting the user's requirements and making the software directly operable."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Code Reviewer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to review and assess source code written by programmers. You ensure code quality by identifying bugs, optimizing performance, and enforcing coding standards. You provide constructive feedback to improve software robustness.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and work closely with programmers.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a standard wordle game by providing a daily 5-letter English language word. The game should allow a player to take 6 turns to guess the word. Correct guess for each letter is colored by green (correct letter in correct position), grey for invalid letter, or yellow for correct letter in wrong position. It should be playable from Linux Terminal, and does not require me to access a dedicated UX or GUI platform, i.e. print the results on terminal at each stage and let me play it there by entering inputs. If the player guesses the word within the allowed number of attempts, they win. If not, the solution is revealed. Validate each guess for proper feedback..
To complete the task, you will review the code submitted by programmers, identify issues, and suggest improvements to meet quality standards.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Design a standard wordle game by providing a daily 5-letter English language word. The game should allow a player to take 6 turns to guess the word. Correct guess for each letter is colored by green (correct letter in correct position), grey for invalid letter, or yellow for correct letter in wrong position.

To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The highest priority issue is that the current implementation selects a random word each time the game is started, rather than providing a daily word as specified by the user's requirement ("providing a daily 5-letter English language word"). This means that multiple runs on the same day could yield different words, which does not conform to the user's requirement.

To fix this issue, you should modify the word selection logic to consistently select the same word for a given day. You can achieve this by using the current date as a seed for the random number generator, ensuring the same word is chosen throughout the day.

Here's how you can revise the `__init__` method in `wordle.py`:

```python
import random
from datetime import datetime

class WordleGame:
    def __init__(self, word_list):
        self.word_list = word_list
        # Use current date as seed to ensure daily consistency
        today = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
        random.seed(today)
        self.target_word = random.choice(self.word_list)
```

This change ensures that the word remains consistent throughout the day, fulfilling the user's requirement of providing a daily word.

Comments on Codes:
"The highest priority issue is that the current implementation selects a random word each time the game is started, rather than providing a daily word as specified by the user's requirement ("providing a daily 5-letter English language word"). This means that multiple runs on the same day could yield different words, which does not conform to the user's requirement.

To fix this issue, you should modify the word selection logic to consistently select the same word for a given day. You can achieve this by using the current date as a seed for the random number generator, ensuring the same word is chosen throughout the day.

Here's how you can revise the `__init__` method in `wordle.py`:

```python
import random
from datetime import datetime

class WordleGame:
    def __init__(self, word_list):
        self.word_list = word_list
        # Use current date as seed to ensure daily consistency
        today = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
        random.seed(today)
        self.target_word = random.choice(self.word_list)
```

This change ensures that the word remains consistent throughout the day, fulfilling the user's requirement of providing a daily word."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
