Considering the customer's requirement for an interactive Checkers (Draughts) game with real-time move updates and visual representation, the most suitable and realizable product modality would be an Application.

An Application developed in Python would allow us to implement the game logic, graphical user interface, and interactive gameplay effectively.

Please share your thoughts or confirm if you agree with this modality.

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of ChatDev. Your primary responsibilities include overseeing all technical aspects of the company. You establish the company's technical vision and lead technological development, ensuring that technology resources align with the company's business needs.
You report to the CEO and collaborate with other executives to integrate technology into the company's strategy.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a Checkers (Draughts) game. Use an 8x8 board, alternate turns between two players, and apply standard capture and kinging rules. Prompt for moves in notation (e.g., from-to positions) and update the board state accordingly..
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

### Step 1: Architecture Overview

We will structure the Checkers game into the following Python files:

1. **main.py**: Entry point of the program, handles user interaction and game loop.
2. **board.py**: Contains the Board class, responsible for managing the board state, moves, captures, and kinging logic.
3. **piece.py**: Contains the Piece class, representing individual checkers pieces.

---

### Step 2: Classes and Methods Overview

#### main.py
- `main()`: Entry point, handles the game loop, user input, and displays the board.

#### board.py
- `class Board`: Manages the board state.
  - `__init__()`: Initializes the board with pieces.
  - `display()`: Prints the current board state.
  - `move_piece(from_pos, to_pos)`: Moves a piece from one position to another.
  - `valid_move(from_pos, to_pos, player)`: Checks if a move is valid.
  - `has_winner()`: Checks if there is a winner.
  - `get_piece(pos)`: Returns the piece at a given position.
  - `remove_piece(pos)`: Removes a piece from the board.
  - `is_capture_move(from_pos, to_pos)`: Checks if a move is a capture move.
  - `king_piece_if_needed(piece, to_pos)`: Kings a piece if it reaches the opposite end.

#### piece.py
- `class Piece`: Represents a single checker piece.
  - `__init__(player, king=False)`: Initializes a piece with player ownership and king status.
  - `__repr__()`: Returns a string representation of the piece.

### Step 4: Running the Application

To run the application, ensure all three files (`main.py`, `board.py`, `piece.py`) are in the same directory. Execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

The game will prompt players alternately for moves in the format `b6-a5`. The board updates after each move, and the game continues until a winner is determined.

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a Checkers (Draughts) game. Use an 8x8 board, alternate turns between two players, and apply standard capture and kinging rules. Prompt for moves in notation (e.g., from-to positions) and update the board state accordingly..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

Highest Priority Comment:
The provided `piece.py` file is incorrect and incomplete. It currently contains only the line `python main.py`, which is invalid Python code. The `Piece` class is referenced in `board.py` but is not implemented, violating regulations 1 and 2.

Suggestions on Revision:
You must implement the `Piece` class properly in `piece.py`. Here is a suggested implementation:

```python
'''
Piece class representing a Checkers game piece.
'''

class Piece:
    def __init__(self, player):
        self.player = player  # 'W' for white, 'B' for black
        self.king = False

    def __str__(self):
        if self.king:
            return self.player.upper()
        return self.player.lower()
```

Replace the current content of `piece.py` with the above implementation. This will ensure the class is correctly imported and used in `board.py`, satisfying all regulations.

Comments on Codes:
"Highest Priority Comment:
The provided `piece.py` file is incorrect and incomplete. It currently contains only the line `python main.py`, which is invalid Python code. The `Piece` class is referenced in `board.py` but is not implemented, violating regulations 1 and 2.

Suggestions on Revision:
You must implement the `Piece` class properly in `piece.py`. Here is a suggested implementation:

```python
'''
Piece class representing a Checkers game piece.
'''

class Piece:
    def __init__(self, player):
        self.player = player  # 'W' for white, 'B' for black
        self.king = False

    def __str__(self):
        if self.king:
            return self.player.upper()
        return self.player.lower()
```

Replace the current content of `piece.py` with the above implementation. This will ensure the class is correctly imported and used in `board.py`, satisfying all regulations."

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a Checkers (Draughts) game. Use an 8x8 board, alternate turns between two players, and apply standard capture and kinging rules. Prompt for moves in notation (e.g., from-to positions) and update the board state accordingly..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation does not enforce mandatory capture moves, which is a fundamental rule in Checkers. According to standard Checkers rules, if a capture move is available, the player must perform it. The current logic allows players to make non-capturing moves even when capturing moves are possible, which violates the game's rules.

Suggestions for Revision:

1. Implement a method to check if any capturing moves are available for the current player before allowing a move.
2. Modify the `valid_move` method to enforce mandatory captures by checking if a capture is available and disallowing non-capturing moves when captures exist.
3. Clearly inform the player when a capture is mandatory.

Example implementation steps:

In `board.py`, add the following method to detect available captures:

```python
def has_capture_moves(self, player):
    for row in range(8):
        for col in range(8):
            piece = self.get_piece((row, col))
            if piece and piece.player == player:
                directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    mid_row, mid_col = row + dr, col + dc
                    end_row, end_col = row + 2*dr, col + 2*dc
                    if 0 <= end_row < 8 and 0 <= end_col < 8:
                        mid_piece = self.get_piece((mid_row, mid_col))
                        end_piece = self.get_piece((end_row, end_col))
                        if mid_piece and mid_piece.player != player and not end_piece:
                            return True
    return False
```

Then, modify the `valid_move` method to enforce mandatory captures:

```python
def valid_move(self, from_pos, to_pos, player):
    piece = self.get_piece(from_pos)
    if not piece or piece.player != player or self.get_piece(to_pos):
        return False

    capture_available = self.has_capture_moves(player)
    is_capture_move = self.is_capture_move(from_pos, to_pos)

    if capture_available and not is_capture_move:
        return False  # Must perform capture if available

    row_diff = to_pos[0] - from_pos[0]
    col_diff = abs(to_pos[1] - from_pos[1])

    if piece.king:
        valid_direction = abs(row_diff) == 1 or abs(row_diff) == 2
    else:
        valid_direction = (row_diff == 1 if player == 'W' else row_diff == -1) or \
                          (row_diff == 2 if player == 'W' else row_diff == -2)

    if col_diff == 1 and abs(row_diff) == 1 and valid_direction and not capture_available:
        return True
    elif col_diff == 2 and abs(row_diff) == 2 and valid_direction:
        mid_row = (from_pos[0] + to_pos[0]) // 2
        mid_col = (from_pos[1] + to_pos[1]) // 2
        mid_piece = self.get_piece((mid_row, mid_col))
        return mid_piece and mid_piece.player != player
    return False
```

This ensures the game logic adheres strictly to standard Checkers rules, providing a correct and fair gameplay experience.

    else:
        valid_direction = (row_diff == 1 if player == 'W' else row_diff == -1) or \

Comments on Codes:
"Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation does not enforce mandatory capture moves, which is a fundamental rule in Checkers. According to standard Checkers rules, if a capture move is available, the player must perform it. The current logic allows players to make non-capturing moves even when capturing moves are possible, which violates the game's rules.

Suggestions for Revision:

1. Implement a method to check if any capturing moves are available for the current player before allowing a move.
2. Modify the `valid_move` method to enforce mandatory captures by checking if a capture is available and disallowing non-capturing moves when captures exist.
3. Clearly inform the player when a capture is mandatory.

Example implementation steps:

In `board.py`, add the following method to detect available captures:

```python
def has_capture_moves(self, player):
    for row in range(8):
        for col in range(8):
            piece = self.get_piece((row, col))
            if piece and piece.player == player:
                directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    mid_row, mid_col = row + dr, col + dc
                    end_row, end_col = row + 2*dr, col + 2*dc
                    if 0 <= end_row < 8 and 0 <= end_col < 8:
                        mid_piece = self.get_piece((mid_row, mid_col))
                        end_piece = self.get_piece((end_row, end_col))
                        if mid_piece and mid_piece.player != player and not end_piece:
                            return True
    return False
```

Then, modify the `valid_move` method to enforce mandatory captures:

```python
def valid_move(self, from_pos, to_pos, player):
    piece = self.get_piece(from_pos)
    if not piece or piece.player != player or self.get_piece(to_pos):
        return False

    capture_available = self.has_capture_moves(player)
    is_capture_move = self.is_capture_move(from_pos, to_pos)

    if capture_available and not is_capture_move:
        return False  # Must perform capture if available

    row_diff = to_pos[0] - from_pos[0]
    col_diff = abs(to_pos[1] - from_pos[1])

    if piece.king:
        valid_direction = abs(row_diff) == 1 or abs(row_diff) == 2
    else:
        valid_direction = (row_diff == 1 if player == 'W' else row_diff == -1) or \
                          (row_diff == 2 if player == 'W' else row_diff == -2)

    if col_diff == 1 and abs(row_diff) == 1 and valid_direction and not capture_available:
        return True
    elif col_diff == 2 and abs(row_diff) == 2 and valid_direction:
        mid_row = (from_pos[0] + to_pos[0]) // 2
        mid_col = (from_pos[1] + to_pos[1]) // 2
        mid_piece = self.get_piece((mid_row, mid_col))
        return mid_piece and mid_piece.player != player
    return False
```

This ensures the game logic adheres strictly to standard Checkers rules, providing a correct and fair gameplay experience."

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Code Reviewer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to review and assess source code written by programmers. You ensure code quality by identifying bugs, optimizing performance, and enforcing coding standards. You provide constructive feedback to improve software robustness.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and work closely with programmers.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a Checkers (Draughts) game. Use an 8x8 board, alternate turns between two players, and apply standard capture and kinging rules. Prompt for moves in notation (e.g., from-to positions) and update the board state accordingly..
To complete the task, you will review the code submitted by programmers, identify issues, and suggest improvements to meet quality standards.]

According to standard Checkers rules, if a capture move is available, the player must perform it. The current logic allows players to make non-capturing moves even when capturing moves are possible, which violates the game's rules.\n\nSuggestions for Revision:\n\n1. Implement a method to check if any capturing moves are available for the current player before allowing a move.\n2. Modify the valid_move method to enforce mandatory captures by checking if a capture is available and disallowing non-capturing moves when captures exist.\n3. Clearly inform the player when a capture is mandatory.\n\nExample implementation steps:\n\nIn board.py, add the following method to detect available captures:\n\npython\ndef has_capture_moves(self, player):\n    for row in range(8):\n        for col in range(8):\n            piece = self.get_piece((row, col))\n            if piece and piece.player == player:\n                directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]\n                for dr, dc in directions:\n                    mid_row, mid_col = row + dr, col + dc\n                    end_row, end_col = row + 2*dr, col + 2*dc\n                    if 0 &lt;= end_row &lt; 8 and 0 &lt;= end_col &lt; 8:\n                        mid_piece = self.get_piece((mid_row, mid_col))\n                        end_piece = self.get_piece((end_row, end_col))\n                        if mid_piece and mid_piece.player != player and not end_piece:\n                            return True\n    return False\n\n\nThen, modify the valid_move method to enforce mandatory captures:\n\npython\ndef valid_move(self, from_pos, to_pos, player):\n    piece = self.get_piece(from_pos)\n    if not piece or piece.player != player or self.get_piece(to_pos):\n        return False\n\n    capture_available = self.has_capture_moves(player)\n    is_capture_move = self.is_capture_move(from_pos, to_pos)\n\n    if capture_available and not is_capture_move:\n        return False  # Must perform capture if available\n\n    row_diff = to_pos[0] - from_pos[0]\n    col_diff = abs(to_pos[1] - from_pos[1])\n\n    if piece.king:\n        valid_direction = abs(row_diff) == 1 or abs(row_diff) == 2\n    else:\n        valid_direction = (row_diff == 1 if player == 'W' else row_diff == -1) or \\\n                          (row_diff == 2 if player == 'W' else row_diff == -2)\n\n    if col_diff == 1 and abs(row_diff) == 1 and valid_direction and not capture_available:\n        return True\n    elif col_diff == 2 and abs(row_diff) == 2 and valid_direction:\n        mid_row = (from_pos[0] + to_pos[0]) // 2\n        mid_col = (from_pos[1] + to_pos[1]) // 2\n        mid_piece = self.get_piece((mid_row, mid_col))\n        return mid_piece and mid_piece.player != player\n    return False\n\n\nThis ensures the game logic adheres strictly to standard Checkers rules, providing a correct and fair gameplay experience."} |

Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation does not handle the scenario of multiple sequential captures (multi-jump moves), which is a standard rule in Checkers. After performing a capture, if another capture is immediately possible with the same piece, the player must continue capturing with that piece until no further captures are possible.

Suggestions on Revision:

1. Modify the `move_piece` method in `board.py` to return a boolean indicating whether a capture was performed.

2. After a capture move, check if additional captures are possible with the same piece. If so, enforce the player to continue capturing with the same piece.

3. Adjust the main game loop in `main.py` to handle multiple sequential captures by prompting the player to continue moving the same piece until no further captures are available.

Example modification in `board.py`:

```python
def move_piece(self, from_pos, to_pos):
    piece = self.get_piece(from_pos)
    self.board[to_pos[0]][to_pos[1]] = piece
    self.remove_piece(from_pos)
    captured = False
    if self.is_capture_move(from_pos, to_pos):
        mid_row = (from_pos[0] + to_pos[0]) // 2
        mid_col = (from_pos[1] + to_pos[1]) // 2
        self.remove_piece((mid_row, mid_col))
        captured = True
    self.king_piece_if_needed(piece, to_pos)
    return captured
```

Example modification in `main.py`:

```python
def main():
    board = Board()
    current_player = 'W'
    while not board.has_winner():
        board.display()
        print(f"Player {current_player}'s turn (e.g., b6-a5):")
        if board.has_capture_moves(current_player):
            print("Capture move available! You must perform a capture.")
        move_str = input().strip()
        from_pos, to_pos = parse_input(move_str)
        if from_pos is None or not board.valid_move(from_pos, to_pos, current_player):
            print("Invalid move. Try again.")
            continue
        captured = board.move_piece(from_pos, to_pos)
        
        # Handle multiple sequential captures
        while captured and board.has_capture_moves_from_position(to_pos, current_player):
            board.display()
            print(f"Player {current_player}, you must continue capturing with the same piece at {chr(to_pos[1]+ord('a'))}{to_pos[0]+1}:")
            move_str = input().strip()
            new_from_pos, new_to_pos = parse_input(move_str)
            if new_from_pos != to_pos or not board.valid_move(new_from_pos, new_to_pos, current_player):
                print("Invalid move. You must continue capturing with the same piece. Try again.")
                continue
            captured = board.move_piece(new_from_pos, new_to_pos)
            to_pos = new_to_pos

        # Switch player
        current_player = 'B' if current_player == 'W' else 'W'
```

Additionally, implement the helper method `has_capture_moves_from_position` in `board.py`:

```python
def has_capture_moves_from_position(self, pos, player):
    row, col = pos
    piece = self.get_piece(pos)
    if not piece or piece.player != player:
        return False
    directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
    for dr, dc in directions:
        mid_row, mid_col = row + dr, col + dc
        end_row, end_col = row + 2*dr, col + 2*dc
        if 0 <= end_row < 8 and 0 <= end_col < 8:
            mid_piece = self.get_piece((mid_row, mid_col))
            end_piece = self.get_piece((end_row, end_col))
            if mid_piece and mid_piece.player != player and not end_piece:
                return True
    return False
```

This ensures compliance with standard Checkers rules and enhances the robustness of the game logic.

                print("Invalid move. You must continue capturing with the same piece. Try again.")
                continue
            captured = board.move_piece(new_from_pos, new_to_pos)
            to_pos = new_to_pos

        # Switch player
        current_player = 'B' if current_player == 'W' else 'W'
```

Additionally, implement the helper method `has_capture_moves_from_position` in `board.py`:

```python
def has_capture_moves_from_position(self, pos, player):
    row, col = pos
    piece = self.get_piece(pos)
    if not piece or piece.player != player:
        return False
    directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
    for dr, dc in directions:
        mid_row, mid_col = row + dr, col + dc
        end_row, end_col = row + 2*dr, col + 2*dc
        if 0 <= end_row < 8 and 0 <= end_col < 8:
            mid_piece = self.get_piece((mid_row, mid_col))
            end_piece = self.get_piece((end_row, end_col))
            if mid_piece and mid_piece.player != player and not end_piece:
                return True
    return False
```

This ensures compliance with standard Checkers rules and enhances the robustness of the game logic.

Comments on Codes:
"Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation does not handle the scenario of multiple sequential captures (multi-jump moves), which is a standard rule in Checkers. After performing a capture, if another capture is immediately possible with the same piece, the player must continue capturing with that piece until no further captures are possible.

Suggestions on Revision:

1. Modify the `move_piece` method in `board.py` to return a boolean indicating whether a capture was performed.

2. After a capture move, check if additional captures are possible with the same piece. If so, enforce the player to continue capturing with the same piece.

3. Adjust the main game loop in `main.py` to handle multiple sequential captures by prompting the player to continue moving the same piece until no further captures are available.

Example modification in `board.py`:

```python
def move_piece(self, from_pos, to_pos):
    piece = self.get_piece(from_pos)
    self.board[to_pos[0]][to_pos[1]] = piece
    self.remove_piece(from_pos)
    captured = False
    if self.is_capture_move(from_pos, to_pos):
        mid_row = (from_pos[0] + to_pos[0]) // 2
        mid_col = (from_pos[1] + to_pos[1]) // 2
        self.remove_piece((mid_row, mid_col))
        captured = True
    self.king_piece_if_needed(piece, to_pos)
    return captured
```

Example modification in `main.py`:

```python
def main():
    board = Board()
    current_player = 'W'
    while not board.has_winner():
        board.display()
        print(f"Player {current_player}'s turn (e.g., b6-a5):")
        if board.has_capture_moves(current_player):
            print("Capture move available! You must perform a capture.")
        move_str = input().strip()
        from_pos, to_pos = parse_input(move_str)
        if from_pos is None or not board.valid_move(from_pos, to_pos, current_player):
            print("Invalid move. Try again.")
            continue
        captured = board.move_piece(from_pos, to_pos)
        
        # Handle multiple sequential captures
        while captured and board.has_capture_moves_from_position(to_pos, current_player):
            board.display()
            print(f"Player {current_player}, you must continue capturing with the same piece at {chr(to_pos[1]+ord('a'))}{to_pos[0]+1}:")
            move_str = input().strip()
            new_from_pos, new_to_pos = parse_input(move_str)
            if new_from_pos != to_pos or not board.valid_move(new_from_pos, new_to_pos, current_player):
                print("Invalid move. You must continue capturing with the same piece. Try again.")
                continue
            captured = board.move_piece(new_from_pos, new_to_pos)
            to_pos = new_to_pos

        # Switch player
        current_player = 'B' if current_player == 'W' else 'W'
```

Additionally, implement the helper method `has_capture_moves_from_position` in `board.py`:

```python
def has_capture_moves_from_position(self, pos, player):
    row, col = pos
    piece = self.get_piece(pos)
    if not piece or piece.player != player:
        return False
    directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
    for dr, dc in directions:
        mid_row, mid_col = row + dr, col + dc
        end_row, end_col = row + 2*dr, col + 2*dc
        if 0 <= end_row < 8 and 0 <= end_col < 8:
            mid_piece = self.get_piece((mid_row, mid_col))
            end_piece = self.get_piece((end_row, end_col))
            if mid_piece and mid_piece.player != player and not end_piece:
                return True
    return False
```

This ensures compliance with standard Checkers rules and enhances the robustness of the game logic."

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

# Checkers Game (Draughts)

A simple yet comprehensive Checkers (Draughts) game implemented in Python, providing an interactive command-line interface for two players. The game strictly follows standard Checkers rules, including mandatory captures, multiple sequential captures, and kinging.

---

## 🎲 Game Features

- **Standard 8x8 Checkers Board:** A classic Checkers board layout with clearly marked rows (1-8) and columns (a-h).
- **Two-Player Gameplay:** Alternate turns between two players (White and Black).
- **Mandatory Capture Enforcement:** Players must perform captures when available.
- **Multiple Sequential Captures:** If a capture leads to another possible capture, the player must continue capturing with the same piece.
- **Kinging:** Pieces reaching the opposite side of the board become kings, allowing them to move and capture in both directions.
- **Interactive Command-Line Interface:** Moves are entered using standard Checkers notation (e.g., `b6-a5`).

---

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This project does not require any external Python libraries or dependencies.

However, ensure your Python environment is correctly set up:

```bash
python --version
```

### Downloading the Game

Clone or download the game files (`main.py`, `board.py`, and `piece.py`) to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Game

Navigate to the directory containing the game files and execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## 🎮 How to Play

### Starting the Game

Upon running the game, the board will be displayed in the terminal, and the first player (White) will be prompted to make a move.

### Understanding the Board

The board is displayed with rows numbered from bottom (1) to top (8) and columns labeled from left (a) to right (h). Pieces are represented as follows:

- `w`: White piece
- `b`: Black piece
- `W`: White king
- `B`: Black king
- `.`: Empty square

Example board display:

```
  a b c d e f g h
8 . b . b . b . b 
7 b . b . b . b . 
6 . b . b . b . b 
5 . . . . . . . . 
4 . . . . . . . . 
3 w . w . w . w . 
2 . w . w . w . w 
1 w . w . w . w . 
```

### Making Moves

Moves are entered using standard Checkers notation in the format:

```
<from_position>-<to_position>
```

For example, to move a piece from position `b6` to `a5`, enter:

```
b6-a5
```

- Columns are labeled `a` through `h` from left to right.
- Rows are numbered `1` through `8` from bottom to top.

### Capturing Pieces

- If a capture is available, you must perform it.
- Captures are performed by jumping over an opponent's piece to an empty square immediately beyond it.
- If multiple captures are possible, you must continue capturing with the same piece until no further captures are available.

### Kinging Pieces

- When a piece reaches the farthest row from its starting position (row 8 for White, row 1 for Black), it becomes a king.
- Kings can move and capture in both forward and backward directions.

---

## 🏆 Winning the Game

The game continues until one player has no remaining pieces or no valid moves left. The player with remaining pieces or available moves is declared the winner.

---

## 📌 Example Gameplay

```
Player W's turn (e.g., b6-a5):
b6-a5

Player B's turn (e.g., c3-d4):
c3-d4

Capture move available! You must perform a capture.
Player W's turn (e.g., a5-c3):
a5-c3
```
