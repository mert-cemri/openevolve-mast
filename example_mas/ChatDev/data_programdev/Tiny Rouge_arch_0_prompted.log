The character can move only on floor tiles and cannot pass through walls. The goal is to reach the door to proceed to the next level. The player encounters monsters; combat is resolved by subtracting the monster’s HP from the player's HP. HP is restored by 20–30 points when the player touches a treasure chest. Ensure there is always at least one valid path from the starting position to the door. Include a minimal UI to display the player's current HP and encountered monster stats.

Considering the customer's requirement for an interactive roguelike game with real-time player control, combat mechanics, and minimal UI, the most suitable modality would be an Application.

An Application modality will allow us to implement the interactive gameplay, visual elements, and real-time user input effectively.

Do you agree with this modality, or do you have other suggestions?

I fully agree with your assessment. Given the interactive nature, real-time controls, combat mechanics, and minimal UI requirements, an Application modality implemented via Python would indeed be the most suitable and effective choice.

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Design a roguelike game inspired by Tower of the Sorcerer. Use a fixed 80x80 grid map. The player character is controlled using W/A/S/D keys for movement (up, left, down, right).

Ensure there is always at least one valid path from the starting position to the door. Include a minimal UI to display the player's current HP and encountered monster stats.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

The current map generation logic in `map.py` does not guarantee at least one valid path from the player's starting position to the door, violating the user's requirement: "Ensure there is always at least one valid path from the starting position to the door."

Suggestion for Revision:

Implement a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) after map generation to verify that a valid path exists between the player's starting position and the door. If no valid path is found, regenerate the map until a valid path is ensured. 

Example fix in `map.py`:

```python
from collections import deque

def generate_map(self):
    path_exists = False
    while not path_exists:
        # Generate random map
        for x in range(1, self.size - 1):

        if self.grid[ty][tx] == '.':
            treasure = Treasure(tx, ty)
            self.treasures.append(treasure)

def check_path_exists(self):

    queue = deque([(self.start_x, self.start_y)])
    visited[self.start_y][self.start_x] = True
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]

    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        if (x, y) == (self.door_x, self.door_y):

Here is a new customer's task: Design a roguelike game inspired by Tower of the Sorcerer. Use a fixed 80x80 grid map. The player character is controlled using W/A/S/D keys for movement (up, left, down, right). The character can move only on floor tiles and cannot pass through walls. The goal is to reach the door to proceed to the next level. The player encounters monsters; combat is resolved by subtracting the monster’s HP from the player's HP. HP is restored by 20–30 points when the player touches a treasure chest. Ensure there is always at least one valid path from the starting position to the door. Include a minimal UI to display the player's current HP and encountered monster stats..

Comments on Codes:
"Highest Priority Comment:

The current map generation logic in `map.py` does not guarantee at least one valid path from the player's starting position to the door, violating the user's requirement: "Ensure there is always at least one valid path from the starting position to the door."

Suggestion for Revision:

Implement a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) after map generation to verify that a valid path exists between the player's starting position and the door. If no valid path is found, regenerate the map until a valid path is ensured. 

Example fix in `map.py`:

```python
from collections import deque

def generate_map(self):
    path_exists = False
    while not path_exists:
        # Generate random map
        for x in range(1, self.size - 1):
            for y in range(1, self.size - 1):
                self.grid[y][x] = '.' if random.random() > 0.2 else '#'
        # Ensure start and door positions are open
        self.grid[self.start_y][self.start_x] = '.'
        self.grid[self.door_y][self.door_x] = 'D'
        # Check if path exists
        path_exists = self.check_path_exists()

    # Place monsters and treasures randomly after ensuring path exists
    self.monsters.clear()
    self.treasures.clear()
    for _ in range(50):
        mx, my = random.randint(1, self.size - 2), random.randint(1, self.size - 2)
        if self.grid[my][mx] == '.':
            monster = Monster(mx, my)
            self.monsters.append(monster)
    for _ in range(30):
        tx, ty = random.randint(1, self.size - 2), random.randint(1, self.size - 2)
        if self.grid[ty][tx] == '.':
            treasure = Treasure(tx, ty)
            self.treasures.append(treasure)

def check_path_exists(self):
    visited = [[False for _ in range(self.size)] for _ in range(self.size)]
    queue = deque([(self.start_x, self.start_y)])
    visited[self.start_y][self.start_x] = True
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]

    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        if (x, y) == (self.door_x, self.door_y):
            return True
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < self.size and 0 <= ny < self.size:
                if not visited[ny][nx] and self.grid[ny][nx] in ('.', 'D'):
                    visited[ny][nx] = True
                    queue.append((nx, ny))

| --- | --- |
| **task_prompt** | Design a roguelike game inspired by Tower of the Sorcerer. Use a fixed 80x80 grid map. The player character is controlled using W/A/S/D keys for movement (up, left, down, right). The character can move only on floor tiles and cannot pass through walls. The goal is to reach the door to proceed to the next level. The player encounters monsters; combat is resolved by subtracting the monster’s HP from the player's HP. HP is restored by 20–30 points when the player touches a treasure chest. Ensure there is always at least one valid path from the starting position to the door. Include a minimal UI to display the player's current HP and encountered monster stats. |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Design a roguelike game inspired by Tower of the Sorcerer. Use a fixed 80x80 grid map. The player character is controlled using W/A/S/D keys for movement (up, left, down, right). The character can move only on floor tiles and cannot pass through walls. The goal is to reach the door to proceed to the next level. The player encounters monsters; combat is resolved by subtracting the monster’s HP from the player's HP. HP is restored by 20–30 points when the player touches a treasure chest. Ensure there is always at least one valid path from the starting position to the door. Include a minimal UI to display the player's current HP and encountered monster stats..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

Highest Priority Comment:

The current map generation logic in `map.py` does not guarantee at least one valid path from the player's starting position to the door. The random placement of walls (`'#'`) and floors (`'.'`) could potentially block the path completely, violating the user's requirement: "Ensure there is always at least one valid path from the starting position to the door."

Suggestions on Revision:

To fix this, implement a pathfinding algorithm (such as Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) after generating the map to verify that a valid path exists from the start to the door. If no valid path is found, regenerate the map until a valid path is ensured. Here's a suggested approach:

1. After generating the map, run a BFS or DFS algorithm from the starting position `(start_x, start_y)` to check if the door position `(door_x, door_y)` is reachable.
2. If the door is unreachable, regenerate the map and repeat the check until a valid path is found.

Example implementation snippet to add to `Map` class in `map.py`:

```python
from collections import deque

def is_valid_path(self):
    visited = [[False for _ in range(self.size)] for _ in range(self.size)]
    queue = deque([(self.start_x, self.start_y)])
    visited[self.start_y][self.start_x] = True

    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]

    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        if (x, y) == (self.door_x, self.door_y):
            return True
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < self.size and 0 <= ny < self.size:
                if not visited[ny][nx] and self.grid[ny][nx] in ('.', 'D'):
                    visited[ny][nx] = True
                    queue.append((nx, ny))
    return False

def generate_map(self):
    while True:
        # Existing map generation logic
        for x in range(1, self.size - 1):
            for y in range(1, self.size - 1):
                self.grid[y][x] = '.' if random.random() > 0.2 else '#'
        self.grid[self.start_y][self.start_x] = '.'
        self.grid[self.door_y][self.door_x] = 'D'
        # Check if valid path exists
        if self.is_valid_path():
            break
    # Place monsters and treasures randomly (existing logic)
    self.monsters.clear()
    self.treasures.clear()
    for _ in range(50):
        mx, my = random.randint(1, self.size - 2), random.randint(1, self.size - 2)
        if self.grid[my][mx] == '.':
            monster = Monster(mx, my)
            self.monsters.append(monster)
    for _ in range(30):
        tx, ty = random.randint(1, self.size - 2), random.randint(1, self.size - 2)
        if self.grid[ty][tx] == '.':
            treasure = Treasure(tx, ty)
            self.treasures.append(treasure)
```

This ensures compliance with the user's requirement and improves the robustness of the game logic.

The random placement of walls (`\'#\'`) and floors (`\'.\'`) could potentially block the path completely, violating the user\'s requirement: "Ensure there is always at least one valid path from the starting position to the door."\n\nSuggestions on Revision:\n\nTo fix this, implement a pathfinding algorithm (such as Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) after generating the map to verify that a valid path exists from the start to the door. If no valid path is found, regenerate the map until a valid path is ensured. Here\'s a suggested approach:\n\n1. After generating the map, run a BFS or DFS algorithm from the starting position `(start_x, start_y)` to check if the door position `(door_x, door_y)` is reachable.\n2. If the door is unreachable, regenerate the map and repeat the check until a valid path is found.\n\nExample implementation snippet to add to `Map` class in `map.py`:\n\npython\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_valid_path(self):\n    visited = [[False for _ in range(self.size)] for _ in range(self.size)]\n    queue = deque([(self.start_x, self.start_y)])\n    visited[self.start_y][self.start_x] = True\n\n    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]\n\n    while queue:\n        x, y = queue.popleft()\n        if (x, y) == (self.door_x, self.door_y):\n            return True\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 &lt;= nx &lt; self.size and 0 &lt;= ny &lt; self.size:\n                if not visited[ny][nx] and self.grid[ny][nx] in (\'.\', \'D\'):\n                    visited[ny][nx] = True\n                    queue.append((nx, ny))\n    return False\n\ndef generate_map(self):\n    while True:\n        # Existing map generation logic\n        for x in range(1, self.size - 1):\n            for y in range(1, self.size - 1):\n                self.grid[y][x] = \'.\' if random.random() &gt; 0.2 else \'#\'\n        self.grid[self.start_y][self.start_x] = \'.\'\n        self.grid[self.door_y][self.door_x] = \'D\'\n        # Check if valid path exists\n        if self.is_valid_path():\n            break\n    # Place monsters and treasures randomly (existing logic)\n    self.monsters.clear()\n    self.treasures.clear()\n    for _ in range(50):\n        mx, my = random.randint(1, self.size - 2), random.randint(1, self.size - 2)\n        if self.grid[my][mx] == \'.\':\n            monster = Monster(mx, my)\n            self.monsters.append(monster)\n    for _ in range(30):\n        tx, ty = random.randint(1, self.size - 2), random.randint(1, self.size - 2)\n        if self.grid[ty][tx] == \'.\':\n            treasure = Treasure(tx, ty)\n            self.treasures.append(treasure)\n```\n\nThis ensures compliance with the user\'s requirement and improves the robustness of the game logic.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"Highest Priority Comment:

The current map generation logic in `map.py` does not guarantee at least one valid path from the player's starting position to the door. The random placement of walls (`'#'`) and floors (`'.'`) could potentially block the path completely, violating the user's requirement: "Ensure there is always at least one valid path from the starting position to the door."

Suggestions on Revision:

To fix this, implement a pathfinding algorithm (such as Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) after generating the map to verify that a valid path exists from the start to the door. If no valid path is found, regenerate the map until a valid path is ensured. Here's a suggested approach:

1. After generating the map, run a BFS or DFS algorithm from the starting position `(start_x, start_y)` to check if the door position `(door_x, door_y)` is reachable.
2. If the door is unreachable, regenerate the map and repeat the check until a valid path is found.

Example implementation snippet to add to `Map` class in `map.py`:

```python
from collections import deque

def is_valid_path(self):
    visited = [[False for _ in range(self.size)] for _ in range(self.size)]
    queue = deque([(self.start_x, self.start_y)])
    visited[self.start_y][self.start_x] = True

    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]

    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        if (x, y) == (self.door_x, self.door_y):
            return True
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < self.size and 0 <= ny < self.size:
                if not visited[ny][nx] and self.grid[ny][nx] in ('.', 'D'):
                    visited[ny][nx] = True
                    queue.append((nx, ny))
    return False

def generate_map(self):
    while True:
        # Existing map generation logic
        for x in range(1, self.size - 1):
            for y in range(1, self.size - 1):
                self.grid[y][x] = '.' if random.random() > 0.2 else '#'
        self.grid[self.start_y][self.start_x] = '.'
        self.grid[self.door_y][self.door_x] = 'D'
        # Check if valid path exists
        if self.is_valid_path():
            break
    # Place monsters and treasures randomly (existing logic)
    self.monsters.clear()
    self.treasures.clear()
    for _ in range(50):
        mx, my = random.randint(1, self.size - 2), random.randint(1, self.size - 2)
        if self.grid[my][mx] == '.':
            monster = Monster(mx, my)
            self.monsters.append(monster)
    for _ in range(30):
        tx, ty = random.randint(1, self.size - 2), random.randint(1, self.size - 2)
        if self.grid[ty][tx] == '.':
            treasure = Treasure(tx, ty)
            self.treasures.append(treasure)
```

This ensures compliance with the user's requirement and improves the robustness of the game logic."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

Here is a new customer's task: Design a roguelike game inspired by Tower of the Sorcerer. Use a fixed 80x80 grid map. The player character is controlled using W/A/S/D keys for movement (up, left, down, right). The character can move only on floor tiles and cannot pass through walls. The goal is to reach the door to proceed to the next level. The player encounters monsters; combat is resolved by subtracting the monster’s HP from the player's HP. HP is restored by 20–30 points when the player touches a treasure chest. Ensure there is always at least one valid path from the starting position to the door. Include a minimal UI to display the player's current HP and encountered monster stats..
To complete the task, you will review the code submitted by programmers, identify issues, and suggest improvements to meet quality standards.]

The random placement of walls (`\'#\'`) and floors (`\'.\'`) could potentially block the path completely, violating the user\'s requirement: "Ensure there is always at least one valid path from the starting position to the door."\n\nSuggestions on Revision:\n\nTo fix this, implement a pathfinding algorithm (such as Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) after generating the map to verify that a valid path exists from the start to the door. If no valid path is found, regenerate the map until a valid path is ensured. Here\'s a suggested approach:\n\n1. After generating the map, run a BFS or DFS algorithm from the starting position `(start_x, start_y)` to check if the door position `(door_x, door_y)` is reachable.\n2. If the door is unreachable, regenerate the map and repeat the check until a valid path is found.\n\nExample implementation snippet to add to `Map` class in `map.py`:\n\npython\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_valid_path(self):\n    visited = [[False for _ in range(self.size)] for _ in range(self.size)]\n    queue = deque([(self.start_x, self.start_y)])\n    visited[self.start_y][self.start_x] = True\n\n    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]\n\n    while queue:\n        x, y = queue.popleft()\n        if (x, y) == (self.door_x, self.door_y):\n            return True\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 &lt;= nx &lt; self.size and 0 &lt;= ny &lt; self.size:\n                if not visited[ny][nx] and self.grid[ny][nx] in (\'.\', \'D\'):\n                    visited[ny][nx] = True\n                    queue.append((nx, ny))\n    return False\n\ndef generate_map(self):\n    while True:\n        # Existing map generation logic\n        for x in range(1, self.size - 1):\n            for y in range(1, self.size - 1):\n                self.grid[y][x] = \'.\' if random.random() &gt; 0.2 else \'#\'\n        self.grid[self.start_y][self.start_x] = \'.\'\n        self.grid[self.door_y][self.door_x] = \'D\'\n        # Check if valid path exists\n        if self.is_valid_path():\n            break\n    # Place monsters and treasures randomly (existing logic)\n    self.monsters.clear()\n    self.treasures.clear()\n    for _ in range(50):\n        mx, my = random.randint(1, self.size - 2), random.randint(1, self.size - 2)\n        if self.grid[my][mx] == \'.\':\n            monster = Monster(mx, my)\n            self.monsters.append(monster)\n    for _ in range(30):\n        tx, ty = random.randint(1, self.size - 2), random.randint(1, self.size - 2)\n        if self.grid[ty][tx] == \'.\':\n            treasure = Treasure(tx, ty)\n            self.treasures.append(treasure)\n```\n\nThis ensures compliance with the user\'s requirement and improves the robustness of the game logic.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Design a roguelike game inspired by Tower of the Sorcerer. Use a fixed 80x80 grid map. The player character is controlled using W/A/S/D keys for movement (up, left, down, right). The character can move only on floor tiles and cannot pass through walls. The goal is to reach the door to proceed to the next level. The player encounters monsters; combat is resolved by subtracting the monster’s HP from the player's HP. HP is restored by 20–30 points when the player touches a treasure chest. Ensure there is always at least one valid path from the starting position to the door. Include a minimal UI to display the player's current HP and encountered monster stats..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

Highest Priority Comment:

The current map generation logic in `map.py` does not guarantee at least one valid path from the player's starting position to the door, as required by the user's task. The random placement of walls (`'#'`) could potentially block all possible paths, making the level unwinnable.

Suggestion for Revision:

Implement a pathfinding algorithm (such as A* or BFS) after generating the map to verify that at least one valid path exists from the player's starting position `(start_x, start_y)` to the door position `(door_x, door_y)`. If no valid path is found, regenerate the map or adjust the wall placement until a valid path is ensured.

Example approach to fix this issue:

1. After generating the map, run a BFS or A* algorithm to check if a path exists.
2. If no path is found, regenerate the map or selectively remove walls until a valid path is created.
3. Repeat this process until a valid path is guaranteed.

This ensures compliance with the user's requirement: "Ensure there is always at least one valid path from the starting position to the door."

Comments on Codes:
"Highest Priority Comment:

The current map generation logic in `map.py` does not guarantee at least one valid path from the player's starting position to the door, as required by the user's task. The random placement of walls (`'#'`) could potentially block all possible paths, making the level unwinnable.

Suggestion for Revision:

Implement a pathfinding algorithm (such as A* or BFS) after generating the map to verify that at least one valid path exists from the player's starting position `(start_x, start_y)` to the door position `(door_x, door_y)`. If no valid path is found, regenerate the map or adjust the wall placement until a valid path is ensured.

Example approach to fix this issue:

1. After generating the map, run a BFS or A* algorithm to check if a path exists.
2. If no path is found, regenerate the map or selectively remove walls until a valid path is created.
3. Repeat this process until a valid path is guaranteed.

This ensures compliance with the user's requirement: "Ensure there is always at least one valid path from the starting position to the door.""

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Code Reviewer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to review and assess source code written by programmers. You ensure code quality by identifying bugs, optimizing performance, and enforcing coding standards. You provide constructive feedback to improve software robustness.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and work closely with programmers.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a roguelike game inspired by Tower of the Sorcerer. Use a fixed 80x80 grid map. The player character is controlled using W/A/S/D keys for movement (up, left, down, right). The character can move only on floor tiles and cannot pass through walls. The goal is to reach the door to proceed to the next level. The player encounters monsters; combat is resolved by subtracting the monster’s HP from the player's HP. HP is restored by 20–30 points when the player touches a treasure chest. Ensure there is always at least one valid path from the starting position to the door. Include a minimal UI to display the player's current HP and encountered monster stats..
To complete the task, you will review the code submitted by programmers, identify issues, and suggest improvements to meet quality standards.]

Programming Language: "{language}" Ideas: "{ideas}" Codes:  "{codes}" Requirements: "{requirements}" As the {assistant_role}, by using Markdown, you should write a manual.md file which is a detailed user manual to use the software, including introducing main functions of the software, how to install environment dependencies and how to use/play it. For example: manual.md ``` LangChain Building applications with LLMs through composability Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js. Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of ChatDev. Your primary responsibilities include making high-level decisions about policy and strategy, overseeing the overall operations and resources of ChatDev, and acting as the main point of communication between the board and corporate operations.
As the CEO, you have the authority to make final decisions and terminate conversations when appropriate.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a roguelike game inspired by Tower of the Sorcerer. Use a fixed 80x80 grid map. The player character is controlled using W/A/S/D keys for movement (up, left, down, right). The character can move only on floor tiles and cannot pass through walls. The goal is to reach the door to proceed to the next level. The player encounters monsters; combat is resolved by subtracting the monster’s HP from the player's HP. HP is restored by 20–30 points when the player touches a treasure chest. Ensure there is always at least one valid path from the starting position to the door. Include a minimal UI to display the player's current HP and encountered monster stats..
To complete the task, you will provide strategic guidance and instructions to your team, ensuring that the solution meets the customer's needs and aligns with the company's objectives.]
