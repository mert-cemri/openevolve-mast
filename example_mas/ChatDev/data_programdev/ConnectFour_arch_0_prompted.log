Considering the customer's requirement for an interactive Connect Four game, the most suitable modality would be an "Application," as it allows for interactive gameplay, real-time updates, and user input validation.

Do you agree with this modality, or do you have other suggestions?

To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Implement a standard Connect Four game. Two players alternate placing discs into a seven-column, six-row grid. The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs. Players choose columns by typing a number, and the board updates after each move until a win or draw. Validate column choices and end the game when a winning line is detected or the grid is full.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

### Step-by-step Planning:

1. **Define the structure clearly**:
   - `ConnectFourGame` class: Manages the game state, board, moves, and checks for wins or draws.
   - `main.py`: Entry point for the game, handles user interaction and game loop.

2. **Core Classes and Functions**:
   - Class `ConnectFourGame`:
     - `__init__`: Initializes the game board and state.
     - `display_board`: Prints the current state of the board.
     - `make_move`: Places a disc in the chosen column.
     - `is_valid_move`: Checks if a move is valid.
     - `check_winner`: Checks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins.
     - `is_board_full`: Checks if the board is full (draw condition).

3. **Main file**:
   - `main.py`: Runs the game loop, handles player input, and prints results.

### Explanation of the Implementation:

- The `ConnectFourGame` class encapsulates all the logic related to the game state, moves, and win conditions.
- The `main.py` file handles the game loop, user input, and interaction with the `ConnectFourGame` class.
- The game board is displayed after each move, clearly showing the current state.
- Input validation ensures that the chosen column is within bounds and not already full.
- The game ends immediately when a player wins or when the board is full, indicating a draw.

This implementation fully satisfies the user's requirements and provides a clear, maintainable structure.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The highest priority issue identified:

The current implementation of the `display_board` method does not clearly separate the cells visually, making it difficult for players to distinguish between empty cells and placed discs. This can negatively impact user experience and readability during gameplay.

Suggested revision:

Update the `display_board` method to clearly visualize the board with proper cell boundaries and spacing. For example, you can modify the method as follows:

```python
def display_board(self):
    '''Display the current state of the game board with clear cell boundaries.'''
    print("\nCurrent Board:")
    for row in self.board:
        print('|' + '|'.join(f' {cell} ' for cell in row) + '|')
        print('-' * (self.COLUMNS * 4 + 1))
    print('  ' + '   '.join(str(i) for i in range(self.COLUMNS)))
```

This revision will enhance readability and improve the user experience by clearly delineating each cell and making the game state easier to interpret.

Comments on Codes:
"The highest priority issue identified:

The current implementation of the `display_board` method does not clearly separate the cells visually, making it difficult for players to distinguish between empty cells and placed discs. This can negatively impact user experience and readability during gameplay.

Suggested revision:

Update the `display_board` method to clearly visualize the board with proper cell boundaries and spacing. For example, you can modify the method as follows:

```python
def display_board(self):
    '''Display the current state of the game board with clear cell boundaries.'''
    print("\nCurrent Board:")
    for row in self.board:
        print('|' + '|'.join(f' {cell} ' for cell in row) + '|')
        print('-' * (self.COLUMNS * 4 + 1))
    print('  ' + '   '.join(str(i) for i in range(self.COLUMNS)))
```

This revision will enhance readability and improve the user experience by clearly delineating each cell and making the game state easier to interpret."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

# Connect Four Game

A simple and interactive Connect Four game implemented in Python. This game allows two players to compete by alternately placing discs into a seven-column, six-row grid. The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs.

## 🎯 Features

- Interactive command-line interface.
- Clear visual representation of the game board.
- Automatic validation of player moves.
- Detection of winning conditions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
- Detection of draw conditions when the board is full.
- Easy-to-follow prompts and error messages.

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setup

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.

3. Install dependencies (no external dependencies required):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(Note: This project does not require external dependencies, so the above command will not install any additional packages.)*

## 🚀 How to Play

### Starting the Game

Run the game by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Gameplay Instructions

- The game starts with Player X.
- Players alternate turns, choosing a column number (0-6) to drop their disc.
- The disc will occupy the lowest available space in the chosen column.
- After each move, the board updates and displays the current state.
- The game continues until one player forms a line of four discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until the board is full, resulting in a draw.

### Making Moves

- When prompted, enter the column number (0-6) where you want to place your disc.
- Example:

```
Player X, choose a column (0-6): 3
```

### Winning the Game

- The game automatically checks for a winning condition after each move.
- If a player successfully connects four discs, the game announces the winner and ends.

### Draw Condition

- If all spaces on the board are filled without any player connecting four discs, the game announces a draw.

### Exiting the Game

- To exit the game at any time, press `Ctrl+C`.
