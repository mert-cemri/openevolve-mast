You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

The application validates if letters match and confirms completion when all correct words are filled in..
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

Core Classes and Functions:

1. CrosswordPuzzle (class):
   - Manages the crossword puzzle grid, clues, and answers.
   - Methods:
     - display_grid(): Display the current state of the crossword grid.
     - display_clues(): Display the clues for across and down.
     - enter_word(clue_number, direction, word): Allows user to enter a word.
     - validate_word(clue_number, direction, word): Validates if the entered word matches the correct answer.
     - check_completion(): Checks if the crossword puzzle is completed correctly.

2. main() (function):
   - Entry point for the application.
   - Handles user interaction and calls methods from CrosswordPuzzle.

Let's proceed to implement these classes and functions in Python.

Here is a new customer's task: Implement a crossword puzzle. Provide a grid of squares with clues for across and down entries. The user can enter words by specifying the clue number and direction. The application validates if letters match and confirms completion when all correct words are filled in..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

Highest Priority Comment:
The current implementation lacks boundary checks when placing words into the grid. Specifically, in the `enter_word` method, there is no validation to ensure that the word being entered fits within the grid dimensions. This can lead to an "IndexError" if the user inputs a word longer than the available space.

Suggestions for Revision:
1. Implement boundary checking logic in the `validate_word` method to ensure the word fits within the grid dimensions before placing it.
2. Provide clear feedback to the user if the entered word exceeds the grid boundaries.

Revised `validate_word` method example:

```python
def validate_word(self, clue_number, direction, word):
    if direction == 'across':
        answer, (row, col) = self.answers_across.get(clue_number, ("", ()))
        if col + len(word) > len(self.grid[0]):
            print("Word exceeds grid boundaries horizontally.")
            return False
    elif direction == 'down':
        answer, (row, col) = self.answers_down.get(clue_number, ("", ()))
        if row + len(word) > len(self.grid):
            print("Word exceeds grid boundaries vertically.")
            return False
    else:
        print("Invalid direction specified.")
        return False
    return word == answer
```

This ensures that the entered word fits within the grid and prevents potential runtime errors, enhancing the robustness and user-friendliness of the application.

Comments on Codes:
"Highest Priority Comment:
The current implementation lacks boundary checks when placing words into the grid. Specifically, in the `enter_word` method, there is no validation to ensure that the word being entered fits within the grid dimensions. This can lead to an "IndexError" if the user inputs a word longer than the available space.

Suggestions for Revision:
1. Implement boundary checking logic in the `validate_word` method to ensure the word fits within the grid dimensions before placing it.
2. Provide clear feedback to the user if the entered word exceeds the grid boundaries.

Revised `validate_word` method example:

```python
def validate_word(self, clue_number, direction, word):
    if direction == 'across':
        answer, (row, col) = self.answers_across.get(clue_number, ("", ()))
        if col + len(word) > len(self.grid[0]):
            print("Word exceeds grid boundaries horizontally.")
            return False
    elif direction == 'down':
        answer, (row, col) = self.answers_down.get(clue_number, ("", ()))
        if row + len(word) > len(self.grid):
            print("Word exceeds grid boundaries vertically.")
            return False
    else:
        print("Invalid direction specified.")
        return False
    return word == answer
```

This ensures that the entered word fits within the grid and prevents potential runtime errors, enhancing the robustness and user-friendliness of the application."

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Highest Priority Comment:
The current implementation does not validate if the user's entered word conflicts with previously entered words at intersecting grid positions. This can lead to logical inconsistencies where intersecting letters do not match, violating crossword puzzle rules.

Suggestions on Revision:
Modify the `validate_word` method to include additional logic that checks if each letter of the user's input matches any existing letters already placed on the grid at intersecting positions. If a mismatch is detected, the method should return False and inform the user about the conflicting letter.

Example revision for the `validate_word` method:

```python
def validate_word(self, clue_number, direction, word):
    word = word.upper()
    if direction == 'across':
        answer, (row, col) = self.answers_across.get(clue_number, ("", ()))
        if col + len(word) > len(self.grid[0]):
            print("Word exceeds grid boundaries horizontally.")
            return False
        for i, letter in enumerate(word):
            existing_letter = self.user_grid[row][col + i]
            if existing_letter != '_' and existing_letter != letter:
                print(f"Letter conflict at position ({row}, {col + i}). Expected '{existing_letter}', got '{letter}'.")
                return False
    elif direction == 'down':
        answer, (row, col) = self.answers_down.get(clue_number, ("", ()))
        if row + len(word) > len(self.grid):
            print("Word exceeds grid boundaries vertically.")
            return False
        for i, letter in enumerate(word):
            existing_letter = self.user_grid[row + i][col]
            if existing_letter != '_' and existing_letter != letter:
                print(f"Letter conflict at position ({row + i}, {col}). Expected '{existing_letter}', got '{letter}'.")
                return False
    else:
        print("Invalid direction specified.")
        return False
    return word == answer
```

This ensures that the crossword puzzle logic remains consistent and prevents users from entering conflicting words.

Comments on Codes:
"Highest Priority Comment:
The current implementation does not validate if the user's entered word conflicts with previously entered words at intersecting grid positions. This can lead to logical inconsistencies where intersecting letters do not match, violating crossword puzzle rules.

Suggestions on Revision:
Modify the `validate_word` method to include additional logic that checks if each letter of the user's input matches any existing letters already placed on the grid at intersecting positions. If a mismatch is detected, the method should return False and inform the user about the conflicting letter.

Example revision for the `validate_word` method:

```python
def validate_word(self, clue_number, direction, word):
    word = word.upper()
    if direction == 'across':
        answer, (row, col) = self.answers_across.get(clue_number, ("", ()))
        if col + len(word) > len(self.grid[0]):
            print("Word exceeds grid boundaries horizontally.")
            return False
        for i, letter in enumerate(word):
            existing_letter = self.user_grid[row][col + i]
            if existing_letter != '_' and existing_letter != letter:
                print(f"Letter conflict at position ({row}, {col + i}). Expected '{existing_letter}', got '{letter}'.")
                return False
    elif direction == 'down':
        answer, (row, col) = self.answers_down.get(clue_number, ("", ()))
        if row + len(word) > len(self.grid):
            print("Word exceeds grid boundaries vertically.")
            return False
        for i, letter in enumerate(word):
            existing_letter = self.user_grid[row + i][col]
            if existing_letter != '_' and existing_letter != letter:
                print(f"Letter conflict at position ({row + i}, {col}). Expected '{existing_letter}', got '{letter}'.")
                return False
    else:
        print("Invalid direction specified.")
        return False
    return word == answer
```

This ensures that the crossword puzzle logic remains consistent and prevents users from entering conflicting words."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation of the `validate_word` method strictly compares the user's input word with the correct answer (`return word == answer`). This approach prevents users from partially filling in words or correcting individual letters incrementally, which is a common interaction in crossword puzzles. Additionally, the method does not verify if the user's input length matches the expected answer length, potentially causing index errors or incorrect validations.

Suggestions on Revision:

1. Modify the `validate_word` method to first check if the length of the user's input matches the length of the expected answer. If not, inform the user clearly.

2. Instead of directly comparing the entire word, validate each letter individually against both the correct answer and the current state of the grid. Allow partial matches to enable incremental solving.

3. Provide clear feedback to the user about specific letter mismatches or conflicts, guiding them to correct their input.

Here's how you can revise the `validate_word` method:

```python
def validate_word(self, clue_number, direction, word):
    word = word.upper()
    if direction == 'across':
        answer, (row, col) = self.answers_across.get(clue_number, ("", ()))
        if not answer:
            print("Invalid clue number for across direction.")
            return False
        if len(word) != len(answer):
            print(f"Incorrect word length. Expected {len(answer)} letters.")
            return False
        if col + len(word) > len(self.grid[0]):
            print("Word exceeds grid boundaries horizontally.")
            return False
        for i, letter in enumerate(word):
            correct_letter = answer[i]
            existing_letter = self.user_grid[row][col + i]
            if existing_letter != '_' and existing_letter != letter:
                print(f"Letter conflict at position ({row}, {col + i}). Expected '{existing_letter}', got '{letter}'.")
                return False
            if letter != correct_letter:
                print(f"Incorrect letter '{letter}' at position ({row}, {col + i}).")
                return False
    elif direction == 'down':
        answer, (row, col) = self.answers_down.get(clue_number, ("", ()))
        if not answer:
            print("Invalid clue number for down direction.")
            return False
        if len(word) != len(answer):
            print(f"Incorrect word length. Expected {len(answer)} letters.")
            return False
        if row + len(word) > len(self.grid):
            print("Word exceeds grid boundaries vertically.")
            return False
        for i, letter in enumerate(word):
            correct_letter = answer[i]
            existing_letter = self.user_grid[row + i][col]
            if existing_letter != '_' and existing_letter != letter:
                print(f"Letter conflict at position ({row + i}, {col}). Expected '{existing_letter}', got '{letter}'.")
                return False
            if letter != correct_letter:
                print(f"Incorrect letter '{letter}' at position ({row + i}, {col}).")
                return False
    else:
        print("Invalid direction specified.")
        return False
    return True
```

This revision ensures a more user-friendly interaction, allows incremental solving, and prevents potential runtime errors due to mismatched word lengths or incorrect letter placements.

This approach prevents users from partially filling in words or correcting individual letters incrementally, which is a common interaction in crossword puzzles. Additionally, the method does not verify if the user\'s input length matches the expected answer length, potentially causing index errors or incorrect validations.\n\nSuggestions on Revision:\n\n1. Modify the validate_word method to first check if the length of the user\'s input matches the length of the expected answer. If not, inform the user clearly.\n\n2. Instead of directly comparing the entire word, validate each letter individually against both the correct answer and the current state of the grid. Allow partial matches to enable incremental solving.\n\n3. Provide clear feedback to the user about specific letter mismatches or conflicts, guiding them to correct their input.\n\nHere\'s how you can revise the validate_word method:\n\npython\ndef validate_word(self, clue_number, direction, word):\n    word = word.upper()\n    if direction == \'across\':\n        answer, (row, col) = self.answers_across.get(clue_number, ("", ()))\n        if not answer:\n            print("Invalid clue number for across direction.")\n            return False\n        if len(word) != len(answer):\n            print(f"Incorrect word length.

Comments on Codes:
"Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation of the `validate_word` method strictly compares the user's input word with the correct answer (`return word == answer`). This approach prevents users from partially filling in words or correcting individual letters incrementally, which is a common interaction in crossword puzzles. Additionally, the method does not verify if the user's input length matches the expected answer length, potentially causing index errors or incorrect validations.

Suggestions on Revision:

1. Modify the `validate_word` method to first check if the length of the user's input matches the length of the expected answer. If not, inform the user clearly.

2. Instead of directly comparing the entire word, validate each letter individually against both the correct answer and the current state of the grid. Allow partial matches to enable incremental solving.

3. Provide clear feedback to the user about specific letter mismatches or conflicts, guiding them to correct their input.

Here's how you can revise the `validate_word` method:

```python
def validate_word(self, clue_number, direction, word):
    word = word.upper()
    if direction == 'across':
        answer, (row, col) = self.answers_across.get(clue_number, ("", ()))
        if not answer:
            print("Invalid clue number for across direction.")
            return False
        if len(word) != len(answer):
            print(f"Incorrect word length. Expected {len(answer)} letters.")
            return False
        if col + len(word) > len(self.grid[0]):
            print("Word exceeds grid boundaries horizontally.")
            return False
        for i, letter in enumerate(word):
            correct_letter = answer[i]
            existing_letter = self.user_grid[row][col + i]
            if existing_letter != '_' and existing_letter != letter:
                print(f"Letter conflict at position ({row}, {col + i}). Expected '{existing_letter}', got '{letter}'.")
                return False
            if letter != correct_letter:
                print(f"Incorrect letter '{letter}' at position ({row}, {col + i}).")
                return False
    elif direction == 'down':
        answer, (row, col) = self.answers_down.get(clue_number, ("", ()))
        if not answer:
            print("Invalid clue number for down direction.")
            return False
        if len(word) != len(answer):
            print(f"Incorrect word length. Expected {len(answer)} letters.")
            return False
        if row + len(word) > len(self.grid):
            print("Word exceeds grid boundaries vertically.")
            return False
        for i, letter in enumerate(word):
            correct_letter = answer[i]
            existing_letter = self.user_grid[row + i][col]
            if existing_letter != '_' and existing_letter != letter:
                print(f"Letter conflict at position ({row + i}, {col}). Expected '{existing_letter}', got '{letter}'.")
                return False
            if letter != correct_letter:
                print(f"Incorrect letter '{letter}' at position ({row + i}, {col}).")
                return False
    else:
        print("Invalid direction specified.")
        return False
    return True

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
