We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

You are the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of ChatDev. Your primary responsibilities include overseeing all technical aspects of the company. You establish the company's technical vision and lead technological development, ensuring that technology resources align with the company's business needs.
You report to the CEO and collaborate with other executives to integrate technology into the company's strategy.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner. Use a standard 3x3 grid, track each player's moves. Players alternate placing X or O, and the game ends when a player wins or the board is full..
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:

1. TicTacToe (class):
    - __init__(self): Initializes the game board and sets the current player.
    - display_board(self): Displays the current state of the board.
    - make_move(self, row, col): Places the current player's mark on the board.
    - check_winner(self): Checks if the current player has won.
    - is_board_full(self): Checks if the board is full.
    - switch_player(self): Switches the current player.

2. main() (function):
    - Runs the game loop, handles user input, and determines the game outcome.

Now, let's implement the files:

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The highest priority issue identified is related to the logic in determining the winner:

Issue:
The current implementation of the `check_winner` method checks if the current player has won after each move, but the main loop immediately congratulates the current player without switching. This logic is correct. However, the current implementation of `check_winner` method only checks for the current player, which is correct, but it does not clearly document this behavior in the method comments. This could potentially confuse future maintainers or developers.

Suggestion to fix:
Update the comment of the `check_winner` method to explicitly state that it checks if the current player has won immediately after their move.

Revised `check_winner` method with improved comment clarity:

```python
def check_winner(self):
    '''
    Checks if the current player has won the game immediately after their move.
    Returns True if the current player has three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
    '''
    # Check rows and columns
    for i in range(3):
        if all(self.board[i][j] == self.current_player for j in range(3)):
            return True
        if all(self.board[j][i] == self.current_player for j in range(3)):
            return True
    # Check diagonals
    if all(self.board[i][i] == self.current_player for i in range(3)):
        return True
    if all(self.board[i][2 - i] == self.current_player for i in range(3)):
        return True
    return False
```

This revision ensures clarity and maintainability of the code logic.

Comments on Codes:
"The highest priority issue identified is related to the logic in determining the winner:

Issue:
The current implementation of the `check_winner` method checks if the current player has won after each move, but the main loop immediately congratulates the current player without switching. This logic is correct. However, the current implementation of `check_winner` method only checks for the current player, which is correct, but it does not clearly document this behavior in the method comments. This could potentially confuse future maintainers or developers.

Suggestion to fix:
Update the comment of the `check_winner` method to explicitly state that it checks if the current player has won immediately after their move.

Revised `check_winner` method with improved comment clarity:

```python
def check_winner(self):
    '''
    Checks if the current player has won the game immediately after their move.
    Returns True if the current player has three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
    '''
    # Check rows and columns
    for i in range(3):
        if all(self.board[i][j] == self.current_player for j in range(3)):
            return True
        if all(self.board[j][i] == self.current_player for j in range(3)):
            return True
    # Check diagonals
    if all(self.board[i][i] == self.current_player for i in range(3)):
        return True
    if all(self.board[i][2 - i] == self.current_player for i in range(3)):
        return True
    return False
```

This revision ensures clarity and maintainability of the code logic."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
