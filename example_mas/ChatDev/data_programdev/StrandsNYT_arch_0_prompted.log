Here is a new customer's task: Implement a version of the NYT Strands puzzle. Strands is a word search game within a 6x8 grid of letters which players use to uncover words falling under a theme. The board must be filled entirely to complete the puzzle - no words will overlap. Each game includes a challenge word called the "spangram" that touches two opposite sides of the board. Themed words will highlight blue; the spangram will highlight yellow. Words can be formed by connecting adjacent letters in any direction (vertically, horizontally, diagonally) and can change direction mid-word. Players can find non-theme words to earn hints. Every 3 non-theme words will unlock a hint! The puzzle must be fully completed by finding all theme words and filling the board..
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

Themed words will highlight blue; the spangram will highlight yellow. Words can be formed by connecting adjacent letters in any direction (vertically, horizontally, diagonally) and can change direction mid-word. Players can find non-theme words to earn hints. Every 3 non-theme words will unlock a hint! The puzzle must be fully completed by finding all theme words and filling the board..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

Highest Priority Comment:

The provided implementation lacks the core game logic to handle the following critical functionalities required by the user's task:
- Ensuring the puzzle board is filled entirely without overlapping words.
- Identifying and highlighting the "spangram" word that touches two opposite sides of the board.
- Differentiating between theme words (highlighted blue), the spangram (highlighted yellow), and non-theme words.
- Allowing players to form words by connecting adjacent letters in any direction, including changing direction mid-word.
- Tracking non-theme words found by the player and unlocking hints every 3 non-theme words.

Currently, the provided code only manages basic board creation, word placement, and validation without addressing these essential gameplay features.

Suggestions on Revision:

1. Implement a dedicated class (e.g., `Game`) to manage the overall game logic, including:
   - Initialization of the puzzle with theme words and the spangram.
   - Logic to ensure the spangram touches two opposite sides of the board.
   - Logic to ensure the board is fully filled without overlapping words.
   - Methods to handle user input, word selection, and validation of words formed by connecting adjacent letters.
   - Tracking of non-theme words found and unlocking hints accordingly.

2. Extend the `PuzzleBoard` class to:
   - Include methods for checking if the spangram correctly touches opposite sides.
   - Provide visual highlighting clearly distinguishing between theme words (blue), spangram (yellow), and non-highlighted letters.

3. Provide a complete executable entry point (`main.py`) that:
   - Imports necessary classes (`PuzzleBoard`, `Game`).
   - Initializes and starts the game loop, handling user interactions and puzzle completion conditions.

By addressing these points, the software will fully comply with the user's requirements and be directly operable without further coding.

| **task_prompt** | Implement a version of the NYT Strands puzzle. Strands is a word search game within a 6x8 grid of letters which players use to uncover words falling under a theme. The board must be filled entirely to complete the puzzle - no words will overlap. Each game includes a challenge word called the "spangram" that touches two opposite sides of the board. Themed words will highlight blue; the spangram will highlight yellow. Words can be formed by connecting adjacent letters in any direction (vertically, horizontally, diagonally) and can change direction mid-word. Players can find non-theme words to earn hints. Every 3 non-theme words will unlock a hint! The puzzle must be fully completed by finding all theme words and filling the board. |

Here is a new customer's task: Implement a version of the NYT Strands puzzle. Strands is a word search game within a 6x8 grid of letters which players use to uncover words falling under a theme. The board must be filled entirely to complete the puzzle - no words will overlap. Each game includes a challenge word called the "spangram" that touches two opposite sides of the board. Themed words will highlight blue; the spangram will highlight yellow. Words can be formed by connecting adjacent letters in any direction (vertically, horizontally, diagonally) and can change direction mid-word. Players can find non-theme words to earn hints. Every 3 non-theme words will unlock a hint! The puzzle must be fully completed by finding all theme words and filling the board..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation of the `is_completed()` method in the `Game` class incorrectly checks puzzle completion by verifying if all theme word positions are a subset of found positions. However, the method `get_found_positions()` simply returns all positions of theme words placed on the board, regardless of whether the player has actually found them. This logic flaw means the puzzle will always appear completed immediately after initialization.

Suggested Revision:

You need to explicitly track the words found by the user. Introduce a new attribute, such as `self.found_theme_words`, to keep track of theme words the player has correctly identified. Update this set each time the player finds a theme word. Then, modify the `is_completed()` method to check if all theme words (including the spangram) have been found by the player.

Example fix:

In `game.py`, modify the `Game` class as follows:

1. Add a new attribute in the `__init__` method:

```python
self.found_theme_words = set()
```

2. Update the `validate_user_word()` method to track found theme words:

```python
def validate_user_word(self, word, positions):
    if not self.board.is_valid_word(word, positions):
        return False, "Invalid word or path."
    for theme_word, theme_positions, _ in self.highlight_words:
        if word == theme_word and set(positions) == set(theme_positions):
            if word not in self.found_theme_words:
                self.found_theme_words.add(word)
                return True, "Theme word found!"
            else:
                return False, "Theme word already found."
    if word not in self.non_theme_words_found:
        self.non_theme_words_found.add(word)
        if len(self.non_theme_words_found) % 3 == 0:
            self.hints_unlocked += 1
            return True, "Non-theme word found! Hint unlocked!"
        return True, "Non-theme word found!"
    return False, "Word already found."
```

3. Correct the `is_completed()` method to check if all theme words have been found:

```python

 Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation of the `is_completed()` method in the `Game` class incorrectly checks puzzle completion by verifying if all theme word positions are a subset of found positions. However, the method `get_found_positions()` simply returns all positions of theme words placed on the board, regardless of whether the player has actually found them. This logic flaw means the puzzle will always appear completed immediately after initialization.

Suggested Revision:

You need to explicitly track the words found by the user. Introduce a new attribute, such as `self.found_theme_words`, to keep track of theme words the player has correctly identified. Update this set each time the player finds a theme word. Then, modify the `is_completed()` method to check if all theme words (including the spangram) have been found by the player.

Example fix:

In `game.py`, modify the `Game` class as follows:

1. Add a new attribute in the `__init__` method:

```python
self.found_theme_words = set()
```

2. Update the `validate_user_word()` method to track found theme words:

```python
def validate_user_word(self, word, positions):
    if not self.board.is_valid_word(word, positions):
        return False, "Invalid word or path."
    for theme_word, theme_positions, _ in self.highlight_words:
        if word == theme_word and set(positions) == set(theme_positions):
            if word not in self.found_theme_words:
                self.found_theme_words.add(word)
                return True, "Theme word found!"
            else:
                return False, "Theme word already found."
    if word not in self.non_theme_words_found:
        self.non_theme_words_found.add(word)
        if len(self.non_theme_words_found) % 3 == 0:
            self.hints_unlocked += 1
            return True, "Non-theme word found! Hint unlocked!"
        return True, "Non-theme word found!"
    return False, "Word already found."
```

3. Correct the `is_completed()` method to check if all theme words have been found:

```python
def is_completed(self):
    required_words = set(self.theme_words + [self.spangram])
    return required_words == self.found_theme_words
```

| **task_prompt** | Implement a version of the NYT Strands puzzle. Strands is a word search game within a 6x8 grid of letters which players use to uncover words falling under a theme. The board must be filled entirely to complete the puzzle - no words will overlap. Each game includes a challenge word called the "spangram" that touches two opposite sides of the board. Themed words will highlight blue; the spangram will highlight yellow. Words can be formed by connecting adjacent letters in any direction (vertically, horizontally, diagonally) and can change direction mid-word. Players can find non-theme words to earn hints. Every 3 non-theme words will unlock a hint! The puzzle must be fully completed by finding all theme words and filling the board. |

Comments on Codes:
"Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation of the `is_completed()` method in the `Game` class incorrectly checks puzzle completion by verifying if all theme word positions are a subset of found positions. However, the method `get_found_positions()` simply returns all positions of theme words placed on the board, regardless of whether the player has actually found them. This logic flaw means the puzzle will always appear completed immediately after initialization.

Suggested Revision:

You need to explicitly track the words found by the user. Introduce a new attribute, such as `self.found_theme_words`, to keep track of theme words the player has correctly identified. Update this set each time the player finds a theme word. Then, modify the `is_completed()` method to check if all theme words (including the spangram) have been found by the player.

Example fix:

In `game.py`, modify the `Game` class as follows:

1. Add a new attribute in the `__init__` method:

```python
self.found_theme_words = set()
```

2. Update the `validate_user_word()` method to track found theme words:

```python
def validate_user_word(self, word, positions):
    if not self.board.is_valid_word(word, positions):
        return False, "Invalid word or path."
    for theme_word, theme_positions, _ in self.highlight_words:
        if word == theme_word and set(positions) == set(theme_positions):
            if word not in self.found_theme_words:
                self.found_theme_words.add(word)
                return True, "Theme word found!"
            else:
                return False, "Theme word already found."
    if word not in self.non_theme_words_found:
        self.non_theme_words_found.add(word)
        if len(self.non_theme_words_found) % 3 == 0:
            self.hints_unlocked += 1
            return True, "Non-theme word found! Hint unlocked!"
        return True, "Non-theme word found!"
    return False, "Word already found."
```

3. Correct the `is_completed()` method to check if all theme words have been found:

```python
def is_completed(self):
    required_words = set(self.theme_words + [self.spangram])
    return required_words == self.found_theme_words
```

This revision ensures the puzzle completion logic accurately reflects user progress, aligning with the user's requirements and providing correct gameplay behavior."

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Code Reviewer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to review and assess source code written by programmers. You ensure code quality by identifying bugs, optimizing performance, and enforcing coding standards. You provide constructive feedback to improve software robustness.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and work closely with programmers.
Here is a new customer's task: Implement a version of the NYT Strands puzzle. Strands is a word search game within a 6x8 grid of letters which players use to uncover words falling under a theme. The board must be filled entirely to complete the puzzle - no words will overlap. Each game includes a challenge word called the "spangram" that touches two opposite sides of the board. Themed words will highlight blue; the spangram will highlight yellow. Words can be formed by connecting adjacent letters in any direction (vertically, horizontally, diagonally) and can change direction mid-word. Players can find non-theme words to earn hints. Every 3 non-theme words will unlock a hint! The puzzle must be fully completed by finding all theme words and filling the board..
To complete the task, you will review the code submitted by programmers, identify issues, and suggest improvements to meet quality standards.]

| **task_prompt** | Implement a version of the NYT Strands puzzle. Strands is a word search game within a 6x8 grid of letters which players use to uncover words falling under a theme. The board must be filled entirely to complete the puzzle - no words will overlap. Each game includes a challenge word called the "spangram" that touches two opposite sides of the board. Themed words will highlight blue; the spangram will highlight yellow. Words can be formed by connecting adjacent letters in any direction (vertically, horizontally, diagonally) and can change direction mid-word. Players can find non-theme words to earn hints. Every 3 non-theme words will unlock a hint! The puzzle must be fully completed by finding all theme words and filling the board. |

However, the method `get_found_positions()` simply returns all positions of theme words placed on the board, regardless of whether the player has actually found them. This logic flaw means the puzzle will always appear completed immediately after initialization.\n\nSuggested Revision:\n\nYou need to explicitly track the words found by the user. Introduce a new attribute, such as `self.found_theme_words`, to keep track of theme words the player has correctly identified. Update this set each time the player finds a theme word. Then, modify the `is_completed()` method to check if all theme words (including the spangram) have been found by the player.\n\nExample fix:\n\nIn `game.py`, modify the `Game` class as follows:\n\n1. Add a new attribute in the `__init__` method:\n\npython\nself.found_theme_words = set()\n\n\n2. Update the `validate_user_word()` method to track found theme words:\n\npython\ndef validate_user_word(self, word, positions):\n    if not self.board.is_valid_word(word, positions):\n        return False, "Invalid word or path."\n    for theme_word, theme_positions, _ in self.highlight_words:\n        if word == theme_word and set(positions) == set(theme_positions):\n            if word not in self.found_theme_words:\n                self.found_theme_words.add(word)\n                return True, "Theme word found!"\n            else:\n                return False, "Theme word already found."\n    if word not in self.non_theme_words_found:\n        self.non_theme_words_found.add(word)\n        if len(self.non_theme_words_found) % 3 == 0:\n            self.hints_unlocked += 1\n            return True, "Non-theme word found!

The board must be filled entirely to complete the puzzle - no words will overlap. Each game includes a challenge word called the "spangram" that touches two opposite sides of the board.

To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation of the `generate_random_positions` method in the `Game` class does not sufficiently ensure that the spangram word touches two opposite sides of the board. Although the `is_spangram_valid` method checks this condition, the random generation approach might frequently fail to place the spangram correctly within the limited number of attempts (100), potentially causing the spangram not to be placed at all, or causing the puzzle initialization to fail silently.

Suggestion for Revision:

To ensure the spangram always meets the requirement of touching two opposite sides, implement a dedicated placement method specifically for the spangram. This method should explicitly select starting positions on one side of the board and systematically generate paths toward the opposite side, ensuring the spangram always satisfies the condition. After placing the spangram, proceed with placing the remaining theme words randomly.

Example of a revised method to place the spangram:

```python
def place_spangram(self, word):
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
    for _ in range(100):
        path = []
        # Choose a random starting side (left, right, top, bottom)
        side = random.choice(['left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom'])
        if side == 'left':
            x, y = 0, random.randint(0, self.board.height - 1)
            target_side = 'right'
        elif side == 'right':
            x, y = self.board.width - 1, random.randint(0, self.board.height - 1)
            target_side = 'left'
        elif side == 'top':
            x, y = random.randint(0, self.board.width - 1), 0
            target_side = 'bottom'
        else:  # bottom
            x, y = random.randint(0, self.board.width - 1), self.board.height - 1
            target_side = 'top'

        path.append((x, y))
        visited = set(path)

        while len(path) < len(word):
            adjacents = self.board.get_adjacent_positions(path[-1])
            adjacents = [pos for pos in adjacents if pos not in visited]
            if not adjacents:

            self.highlight_words.append((word, path, 'yellow'))
            return True
    return False
```

Then, modify the `initialize_board` method to use this dedicated method for placing the spangram first:

```python
def initialize_board(self):
    placed_positions = set()
    # Place spangram first
    if not self.place_spangram(self.spangram):
        raise Exception("Failed to place spangram after multiple attempts.")

    # Place remaining theme words
    for word in self.theme_words:
        placed = False
        attempts = 0
        while not placed and attempts < 100:
            attempts += 1
            positions = self.generate_random_positions(len(word))
            if positions and all(pos not in placed_positions for pos in positions):
                self.board.place_word(word, positions)
                placed_positions.update(positions)
                self.highlight_words.append((word, positions, 'blue'))
                placed = True

    # Fill remaining empty spaces with random letters
    for y in range(self.board.height):
        for x in range(self.board.width):
            if self.board.board[y][x] == '':
                self.board.board[y][x] = random.choice('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ')
```

This revision ensures the spangram always meets the puzzle's critical requirement, improving reliability and user experience.

 Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation of the `generate_random_positions` method in the `Game` class does not sufficiently ensure that the spangram word touches two opposite sides of the board. Although the `is_spangram_valid` method checks this condition, the random generation approach might frequently fail to place the spangram correctly within the limited number of attempts (100), potentially causing the spangram not to be placed at all, or causing the puzzle initialization to fail silently.

Suggestion for Revision:

To ensure the spangram always meets the requirement of touching two opposite sides, implement a dedicated placement method specifically for the spangram. This method should explicitly select starting positions on one side of the board and systematically generate paths toward the opposite side, ensuring the spangram always satisfies the condition. After placing the spangram, proceed with placing the remaining theme words randomly.

Example of a revised method to place the spangram:

```python
def place_spangram(self, word):
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
    for _ in range(100):
        path = []
        # Choose a random starting side (left, right, top, bottom)
        side = random.choice(['left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom'])
        if side == 'left':
            x, y = 0, random.randint(0, self.board.height - 1)
            target_side = 'right'
        elif side == 'right':
            x, y = self.board.width - 1, random.randint(0, self.board.height - 1)
            target_side = 'left'
        elif side == 'top':
            x, y = random.randint(0, self.board.width - 1), 0
            target_side = 'bottom'
        else:  # bottom
            x, y = random.randint(0, self.board.width - 1), self.board.height - 1
            target_side = 'top'

        path.append((x, y))
        visited = set(path)

        while len(path) < len(word):
            adjacents = self.board.get_adjacent_positions(path[-1])
            adjacents = [pos for pos in adjacents if pos not in visited]
            if not adjacents:
                break
            next_pos = random.choice(adjacents)
            path.append(next_pos)
            visited.add(next_pos)

        if len(path) == len(word) and self.board.is_spangram_valid(path):
            self.board.place_word(word, path)
            self.highlight_words.append((word, path, 'yellow'))
            return True
    return False
```

Then, modify the `initialize_board` method to use this dedicated method for placing the spangram first:

```python
def initialize_board(self):
    placed_positions = set()
    # Place spangram first
    if not self.place_spangram(self.spangram):
        raise Exception("Failed to place spangram after multiple attempts.")

    # Place remaining theme words
    for word in self.theme_words:
        placed = False
        attempts = 0
        while not placed and attempts < 100:
            attempts += 1
            positions = self.generate_random_positions(len(word))
            if positions and all(pos not in placed_positions for pos in positions):
                self.board.place_word(word, positions)
                placed_positions.update(positions)
                self.highlight_words.append((word, positions, 'blue'))
                placed = True

    # Fill remaining empty spaces with random letters
    for y in range(self.board.height):
        for x in range(self.board.width):
            if self.board.board[y][x] == '':
                self.board.board[y][x] = random.choice('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ')
```

This revision ensures the spangram always meets the puzzle's critical requirement, improving reliability and user experience.

The board must be filled entirely to complete the puzzle - no words will overlap. Each game includes a challenge word called the "spangram" that touches two opposite sides of the board. Themed words will highlight blue; the spangram will highlight yellow. Words can be formed by connecting adjacent letters in any direction (vertically, horizontally, diagonally) and can change direction mid-word. Players can find non-theme words to earn hints. Every 3 non-theme words will unlock a hint! The puzzle must be fully completed by finding all theme words and filling the board. |

Although the `is_spangram_valid` method checks this condition, the random generation approach might frequently fail to place the spangram correctly within the limited number of attempts (100), potentially causing the spangram not to be placed at all, or causing the puzzle initialization to fail silently.\n\nSuggestion for Revision:\n\nTo ensure the spangram always meets the requirement of touching two opposite sides, implement a dedicated placement method specifically for the spangram. This method should explicitly select starting positions on one side of the board and systematically generate paths toward the opposite side, ensuring the spangram always satisfies the condition. After placing the spangram, proceed with placing the remaining theme words randomly.\n\nExample of a revised method to place the spangram:\n\npython\ndef place_spangram(self, word):\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]\n    for _ in range(100):\n        path = []\n        # Choose a random starting side (left, right, top, bottom)\n        side = random.choice([\'left\', \'right\', \'top\', \'bottom\'])\n        if side == \'left\':\n            x, y = 0, random.randint(0, self.board.height - 1)\n            target_side = \'right\'\n        elif side == \'right\':\n            x, y = self.board.width - 1, random.randint(0, self.board.height - 1)\n            target_side = \'left\'\n        elif side == \'top\':\n            x, y = random.randint(0, self.board.width - 1), 0\n            target_side = \'bottom\'\n        else:  # bottom\n            x, y = random.randint(0, self.board.width - 1), self.board.height - 1\n            target_side = \'top\'\n\n        path.append((x, y))\n        visited = set(path)\n\n        while len(path) &lt; len(word):\n            adjacents = self.board.get_adjacent_positions(path[-1])\n            adjacents = [pos for pos in adjacents if pos not in visited]\n            if not adjacents:\n                break\n            next_pos = random.choice(adjacents)\n            path.append(next_pos)\n            visited.add(next_pos)\n\n        if len(path) == len(word) and self.board.is_spangram_valid(path):\n            self.board.place_word(word, path)\n            self.highlight_words.append((word, path, \'yellow\'))\n            return True\n    return False\n\n\nThen, modify the `initialize_board` method to use this dedicated method for placing the spangram first:\n\npython\ndef initialize_board(self):\n    placed_positions = set()\n    # Place spangram first\n    if not self.place_spangram(self.spangram):\n        raise Exception("Failed to place spangram after multiple attempts.")\n\n    # Place remaining theme words\n    for word in self.theme_words:\n        placed = False\n        attempts = 0\n        while not placed and attempts &lt; 100:\n            attempts += 1\n            positions = self.generate_random_positions(len(word))\n            if positions and all(pos not in placed_positions for pos in positions):\n                self.board.place_word(word, positions)\n                placed_positions.update(positions)\n                self.highlight_words.append((word, positions, \'blue\'))\n                placed = True\n\n    # Fill remaining empty spaces with random letters\n    for y in range(self.board.height):\n        for x in range(self.board.width):\n            if self.board.board[y][x] == \'\':\n                self.board.board[y][x] = random.choice(\'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\')\n```\n\nThis revision ensures the spangram always meets the puzzle\'s critical requirement, improving reliability and user experience.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation of the `generate_random_positions` method in the `Game` class does not sufficiently ensure that the spangram word touches two opposite sides of the board. Although the `is_spangram_valid` method checks this condition, the random generation approach might frequently fail to place the spangram correctly within the limited number of attempts (100), potentially causing the spangram not to be placed at all, or causing the puzzle initialization to fail silently.

Suggestion for Revision:

To ensure the spangram always meets the requirement of touching two opposite sides, implement a dedicated placement method specifically for the spangram. This method should explicitly select starting positions on one side of the board and systematically generate paths toward the opposite side, ensuring the spangram always satisfies the condition. After placing the spangram, proceed with placing the remaining theme words randomly.

Example of a revised method to place the spangram:

```python
def place_spangram(self, word):
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
    for _ in range(100):
        path = []
        # Choose a random starting side (left, right, top, bottom)
        side = random.choice(['left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom'])
        if side == 'left':
            x, y = 0, random.randint(0, self.board.height - 1)
            target_side = 'right'
        elif side == 'right':
            x, y = self.board.width - 1, random.randint(0, self.board.height - 1)
            target_side = 'left'
        elif side == 'top':
            x, y = random.randint(0, self.board.width - 1), 0
            target_side = 'bottom'
        else:  # bottom
            x, y = random.randint(0, self.board.width - 1), self.board.height - 1
            target_side = 'top'

        path.append((x, y))
        visited = set(path)

        while len(path) < len(word):
            adjacents = self.board.get_adjacent_positions(path[-1])
            adjacents = [pos for pos in adjacents if pos not in visited]
            if not adjacents:
                break
            next_pos = random.choice(adjacents)
            path.append(next_pos)
            visited.add(next_pos)

        if len(path) == len(word) and self.board.is_spangram_valid(path):
            self.board.place_word(word, path)
            self.highlight_words.append((word, path, 'yellow'))
            return True
    return False
```

Then, modify the `initialize_board` method to use this dedicated method for placing the spangram first:

```python
def initialize_board(self):
    placed_positions = set()
    # Place spangram first
    if not self.place_spangram(self.spangram):
        raise Exception("Failed to place spangram after multiple attempts.")

    # Place remaining theme words
    for word in self.theme_words:
        placed = False
        attempts = 0
        while not placed and attempts < 100:
            attempts += 1
            positions = self.generate_random_positions(len(word))
            if positions and all(pos not in placed_positions for pos in positions):
                self.board.place_word(word, positions)
                placed_positions.update(positions)
                self.highlight_words.append((word, positions, 'blue'))
                placed = True

    # Fill remaining empty spaces with random letters
    for y in range(self.board.height):
        for x in range(self.board.width):
            if self.board.board[y][x] == '':
                self.board.board[y][x] = random.choice('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ')
```

Here is a new customer's task: Implement a version of the NYT Strands puzzle. Strands is a word search game within a 6x8 grid of letters which players use to uncover words falling under a theme. The board must be filled entirely to complete the puzzle - no words will overlap. Each game includes a challenge word called the "spangram" that touches two opposite sides of the board. Themed words will highlight blue; the spangram will highlight yellow. Words can be formed by connecting adjacent letters in any direction (vertically, horizontally, diagonally) and can change direction mid-word. Players can find non-theme words to earn hints. Every 3 non-theme words will unlock a hint! The puzzle must be fully completed by finding all theme words and filling the board..
To complete the task, you will review the code submitted by programmers, identify issues, and suggest improvements to meet quality standards.]

| **task_prompt** | Implement a version of the NYT Strands puzzle. Strands is a word search game within a 6x8 grid of letters which players use to uncover words falling under a theme. The board must be filled entirely to complete the puzzle - no words will overlap. Each game includes a challenge word called the "spangram" that touches two opposite sides of the board. Themed words will highlight blue; the spangram will highlight yellow. Words can be formed by connecting adjacent letters in any direction (vertically, horizontally, diagonally) and can change direction mid-word. Players can find non-theme words to earn hints. Every 3 non-theme words will unlock a hint! The puzzle must be fully completed by finding all theme words and filling the board. |

Here is a new customer's task: Implement a version of the NYT Strands puzzle. Strands is a word search game within a 6x8 grid of letters which players use to uncover words falling under a theme. The board must be filled entirely to complete the puzzle - no words will overlap. Each game includes a challenge word called the "spangram" that touches two opposite sides of the board. Themed words will highlight blue; the spangram will highlight yellow. Words can be formed by connecting adjacent letters in any direction (vertically, horizontally, diagonally) and can change direction mid-word. Players can find non-theme words to earn hints. Every 3 non-theme words will unlock a hint! The puzzle must be fully completed by finding all theme words and filling the board..

Here is a new customer's task: Implement a version of the NYT Strands puzzle. Strands is a word search game within a 6x8 grid of letters which players use to uncover words falling under a theme. The board must be filled entirely to complete the puzzle - no words will overlap. Each game includes a challenge word called the "spangram" that touches two opposite sides of the board. Themed words will highlight blue; the spangram will highlight yellow. Words can be formed by connecting adjacent letters in any direction (vertically, horizontally, diagonally) and can change direction mid-word. Players can find non-theme words to earn hints. Every 3 non-theme words will unlock a hint! The puzzle must be fully completed by finding all theme words and filling the board..
To complete the task, you will provide strategic guidance and instructions to your team, ensuring that the solution meets the customer's needs and aligns with the company's objectives.]

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

Here is a new customer's task: Implement a version of the NYT Strands puzzle. Strands is a word search game within a 6x8 grid of letters which players use to uncover words falling under a theme. The board must be filled entirely to complete the puzzle - no words will overlap. Each game includes a challenge word called the "spangram" that touches two opposite sides of the board. Themed words will highlight blue; the spangram will highlight yellow. Words can be formed by connecting adjacent letters in any direction (vertically, horizontally, diagonally) and can change direction mid-word. Players can find non-theme words to earn hints. Every 3 non-theme words will unlock a hint! The puzzle must be fully completed by finding all theme words and filling the board..
To complete the task, you will provide strategic guidance and instructions to your team, ensuring that the solution meets the customer's needs and aligns with the company's objectives.]
