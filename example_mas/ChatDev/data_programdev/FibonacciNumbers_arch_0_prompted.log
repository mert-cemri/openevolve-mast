Considering the customer's requirement to generate Fibonacci numbers up to a given number, the most suitable modality would be an Application. This modality allows us to create an interactive and functional tool that can dynamically generate and display Fibonacci numbers based on user input.

Please share your thoughts or confirm if you agree with this modality.

I completely agree with your assessment. An Application modality is indeed the most suitable choice, as it allows users to interactively input their desired number and receive immediate Fibonacci sequence results. It aligns perfectly with the customer's requirement for dynamic and functional interaction.

### Step 1: Planning the Architecture

We will create a simple yet modular Python application to generate Fibonacci numbers up to a given number. The application will consist of two Python files:

1. **main.py**: Entry point of the application, responsible for user interaction and invoking the Fibonacci generator.
2. **fibonacci.py**: Contains the logic for generating Fibonacci numbers.

- **generate_fibonacci_upto(limit)**: Function that generates Fibonacci numbers up to the given limit.

#### main.py
- **main()**: Entry point function that handles user input and displays the generated Fibonacci numbers.

---

### Step 3: Implementing the Files

fibonacci.py

```python
'''
Module responsible for generating Fibonacci numbers.
'''

def generate_fibonacci_upto(limit):
    '''
    Generate Fibonacci numbers up to a given limit.

    Parameters:
        limit (int): The upper limit for Fibonacci numbers generation.

    Returns:
        list: A list of Fibonacci numbers up to the given limit.
    '''
    fibonacci_numbers = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a <= limit:
        fibonacci_numbers.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return fibonacci_numbers
```

main.py

```python
'''
Main module to execute the Fibonacci number generator application.
'''

from fibonacci import generate_fibonacci_upto

def main():
    '''
    Main function to interact with the user and display Fibonacci numbers.
    '''
    try:
        limit = int(input("Enter the upper limit for Fibonacci numbers: "))
        if limit < 0:
            print("Please enter a non-negative integer.")
            return
        fibonacci_numbers = generate_fibonacci_upto(limit)
        print(f"Fibonacci numbers up to {limit}:")
        print(fibonacci_numbers)
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

### Step 4: Running the Application

To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will prompt the user to enter an upper limit and then display the Fibonacci numbers up to that limit.

[2025-31-03 20:42:44 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 ### Step 1: Planning the Architecture

We will create a simple yet modular Python application to generate Fibonacci numbers up to a given number. The application will consist of two Python files:

1. **main.py**: Entry point of the application, responsible for user interaction and invoking the Fibonacci generator.
2. **fibonacci.py**: Contains the logic for generating Fibonacci numbers.

---

### Step 2: Defining Core Classes, Functions, and Methods

#### fibonacci.py
- **generate_fibonacci_upto(limit)**: Function that generates Fibonacci numbers up to the given limit.

#### main.py
- **main()**: Entry point function that handles user input and displays the generated Fibonacci numbers.

---

### Step 3: Implementing the Files

fibonacci.py

```python
'''
Module responsible for generating Fibonacci numbers.
'''

def generate_fibonacci_upto(limit):
    '''
    Generate Fibonacci numbers up to a given limit.

    Parameters:
        limit (int): The upper limit for Fibonacci numbers generation.

    Returns:
        list: A list of Fibonacci numbers up to the given limit.
    '''
    fibonacci_numbers = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a <= limit:
        fibonacci_numbers.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return fibonacci_numbers
```

main.py

```python
'''
Main module to execute the Fibonacci number generator application.
'''

from fibonacci import generate_fibonacci_upto

def main():
    '''
    Main function to interact with the user and display Fibonacci numbers.
    '''
    try:
        limit = int(input("Enter the upper limit for Fibonacci numbers: "))
        if limit < 0:
            print("Please enter a non-negative integer.")
            return
        fibonacci_numbers = generate_fibonacci_upto(limit)
        print(f"Fibonacci numbers up to {limit}:")
        print(fibonacci_numbers)
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

### Step 4: Running the Application

To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will prompt the user to enter an upper limit and then display the Fibonacci numbers up to that limit.

# Fibonacci Number Generator

A simple and efficient Python application to generate Fibonacci numbers up to a specified limit.

---

## 🚀 Introduction

The Fibonacci Number Generator is a lightweight Python application designed to quickly generate Fibonacci sequences up to a user-defined limit. Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of integers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. This application is ideal for educational purposes, algorithm demonstrations, or simply exploring mathematical concepts.

---

## 📌 Main Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use command-line interface for quick interaction.
- **Efficient Algorithm:** Optimized for performance, generating Fibonacci numbers rapidly.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures user inputs are valid and provides helpful error messages.

---

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This application does not require any external dependencies.

However, you can confirm your environment by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(Note: The provided `requirements.txt` file is empty as no external libraries are required.)*

## ▶️ How to Use

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Repository

Clone the repository using git:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

Or simply download and extract the ZIP file containing the source code.

### Step 2: Run the Application

You can run the application directly from your terminal or command prompt.

#### Using Python Directly:

```bash
python main.py
```

#### Using the Provided Shell Script (Linux/MacOS):

Make sure the script has execution permissions:

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
```

Then execute:

```bash
./run.sh
```

### Step 3: Interact with the Application

Upon running the application, you will be prompted to enter an upper limit for the Fibonacci sequence:

```bash
Enter the upper limit for Fibonacci numbers: 100
```

The application will then display the Fibonacci numbers up to the specified limit:

```bash
Fibonacci numbers up to 100:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89
```

### Input Validation:

- If you enter a negative number, the application will prompt you to enter a non-negative integer.
- If you enter invalid input (e.g., letters or symbols), the application will notify you to enter a valid integer.
