Given the customer's requirement for an interactive and visualized game experience, I believe the most suitable modality would be an Application. This modality allows for interactive gameplay, real-time feedback, and clear visualization of the game's state.

What are your thoughts on this modality?

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Implement the classic Mastermind code-breaking game. The computer selects a hidden sequence of colors (or digits), and the player attempts to guess it within a set number of tries. After each guess, show feedback regarding correct color and correct position. Distinguish between exact matches and partial color matches, and provide a clear win/lose outcome.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

### Explanation of Implementation:

- The game selects a hidden code consisting of digits from 0 to 5.
- The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the hidden code.
- After each guess, the game provides feedback:
  - **Exact matches**: Number of digits that are correct and in the correct position.
  - **Partial matches**: Number of digits that are correct but in the wrong position.
- The game ends with a clear win or lose message depending on whether the player guesses correctly within the allowed attempts.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Code Reviewer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to review and assess source code written by programmers. You ensure code quality by identifying bugs, optimizing performance, and enforcing coding standards. You provide constructive feedback to improve software robustness.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and work closely with programmers.
Here is a new customer's task: Implement the classic Mastermind code-breaking game. The computer selects a hidden sequence of colors (or digits), and the player attempts to guess it within a set number of tries. After each guess, show feedback regarding correct color and correct position. Distinguish between exact matches and partial color matches, and provide a clear win/lose outcome..
To complete the task, you will review the code submitted by programmers, identify issues, and suggest improvements to meet quality standards.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.
Here is a new customer's task: Implement the classic Mastermind code-breaking game. The computer selects a hidden sequence of colors (or digits), and the player attempts to guess it within a set number of tries. After each guess, show feedback regarding correct color and correct position. Distinguish between exact matches and partial color matches, and provide a clear win/lose outcome..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

According to the new user's task, our designed product modality, languages and ideas, our developed first-edition source codes are listed below:

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

# 🎲 Mastermind Game 🎲

Welcome to the Mastermind Game! This classic code-breaking game challenges your logic and deduction skills. Can you crack the hidden code?

---

## 📖 Overview

Mastermind is a classic puzzle game where the computer selects a hidden sequence of digits, and your goal is to guess this sequence within a limited number of attempts. After each guess, you'll receive feedback indicating:

- ✅ **Exact Matches**: Number of digits that are correct and in the correct position.
- 🔄 **Partial Matches**: Number of digits that are correct but in the wrong position.

Use this feedback to refine your guesses and crack the code!

---

## 🚀 Features

- Randomly generated hidden code for each new game.
- Customizable code length, digit range, and number of attempts.
- Clear feedback after each guess to guide your next move.
- User-friendly interface with clear win/lose outcomes.

---

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This project does not require any external dependencies. However, ensure your Python environment is properly set up.

You can verify your Python installation by running:

```bash
python --version
```

---

## 🎮 How to Play

### Step 1: Download the Game Files

Ensure you have the following files in the same directory:

- `main.py`
- `game.py`

### Step 2: Run the Game

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the game files, and execute:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 3: Gameplay Instructions

- The computer will select a hidden sequence of digits (default length is 4 digits, each digit ranging from 0 to 5).
- You have a limited number of attempts (default is 10) to guess the correct sequence.
- Enter your guess as a sequence of digits (e.g., `1234`) and press Enter.
- After each guess, you'll receive feedback:
  - ✅ **Exact Matches**: Correct digit in the correct position.
  - 🔄 **Partial Matches**: Correct digit but in the wrong position.
- Continue guessing based on the feedback until you either crack the code or run out of attempts.

### Example Gameplay:

```
🎲 Welcome to Mastermind! 🎲

🔒 I have selected a hidden sequence of 4 digits (0-5).
You have 10 attempts to guess it correctly. Good luck! 🍀

Attempt 1/10: Enter your guess (e.g., 1234): 1234
✅ Exact matches (correct digit and position): 1
🔄 Partial matches (correct digit, wrong position): 2

Attempt 2/10: Enter your guess (e.g., 1234): 1243
✅ Exact matches (correct digit and position): 2
🔄 Partial matches (correct digit, wrong position): 1

...

🎉 Congratulations! You've cracked the code '1423' in 5 attempts! 🎉
```

---

## ⚙️ Customizing the Game (Optional)

You can customize the game parameters by editing the `main.py` file:

- `code_length`: Number of digits in the hidden code.
- `max_attempts`: Maximum number of guesses allowed.
- `digit_range`: Range of digits (0 to digit_range - 1).

Example:

```python
code_length = 6
max_attempts = 12
digit_range = 8  # Digits from 0 to 7
```

---

## 📌 Troubleshooting

- **Invalid Input**: Ensure your guess matches the required length and digit range. The game will prompt you if your input is invalid.
- **Python Errors**: Verify that both `main.py` and `game.py` are in the same directory and that you are running the command from the correct location.
