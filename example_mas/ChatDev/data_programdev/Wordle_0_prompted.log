**task_prompt**: Design a standard wordle game by providing a daily 5-letter English language word. The game should allow a player to take 6 turns to guess the word. Correct guess for each letter is colored by green (correct letter in correct position), grey for invalid letter, or yellow for correct letter in wrong position. It should be playable from Linux Terminal, and does not require me to access a dedicated UX or GUI platform, i.e. print the results on terminal at each stage and let me play it there by entering inputs. If the player guesses the word within the allowed number of attempts, they win. If not, the solution is revealed. Validate each guess for proper feedback.

Given the requirements of the task, the product needs to be a playable game from the Linux Terminal without a dedicated UX or GUI platform. This suggests that the product should be implemented as an application using Python, as it allows for terminal-based interaction and logic implementation. Python is well-suited for creating command-line applications and can handle the logic required for the word guessing game effectively. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. Implementing the game as a Python application will allow us to create a command-line interface that meets the customer's requirements for a terminal-based game. Python's versatility and ease of use make it an ideal choice for developing such applications. Let's proceed with this modality.

Here is a new customer's task: Design a standard wordle game by providing a daily 5-letter English language word. The game should allow a player to take 6 turns to guess the word. Correct guess for each letter is colored by green (correct letter in correct position), grey for invalid letter, or yellow for correct letter in wrong position. It should be playable from Linux Terminal, and does not require me to access a dedicated UX or GUI platform, i.e. print the results on terminal at each stage and let me play it there by entering inputs. If the player guesses the word within the allowed number of attempts, they win. If not, the solution is revealed. Validate each guess for proper feedback..

To implement the Wordle game as specified, we will create a Python application with the following core components:

1. **WordleGame Class**: This class will handle the game logic, including setting the daily word, processing guesses, and providing feedback.

2. **main Function**: This function will initialize the game and manage user interaction through the terminal.

Now, let's lay out the necessary files and their contents:

### wordle_game.py

This file will contain the `WordleGame` class, which encapsulates the game logic.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

| **task_prompt** | Design a standard wordle game by providing a daily 5-letter English language word. The game should allow a player to take 6 turns to guess the word. Correct guess for each letter is colored by green (correct letter in correct position), grey for invalid letter, or yellow for correct letter in wrong position. It should be playable from Linux Terminal, and does not require me to access a dedicated UX or GUI platform, i.e. print the results on terminal at each stage and let me play it there by entering inputs. If the player guesses the word within the allowed number of attempts, they win. If not, the solution is revealed. Validate each guess for proper feedback. |

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Based on the provided code, it appears that the project does not use any external libraries or packages that need to be installed via a package manager like `pip`. The code relies solely on Python's standard library, which means there are no additional dependencies to specify in a `requirements.txt` file.

However, if you plan to expand the project in the future or if there are any hidden dependencies not mentioned in the code snippets, you would list them in the `requirements.txt` file. For now, the `requirements.txt` file can remain empty or you can include a comment indicating that there are no external dependencies:

```plaintext
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

If you do add any external libraries in the future, you can update the `requirements.txt` file accordingly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation
