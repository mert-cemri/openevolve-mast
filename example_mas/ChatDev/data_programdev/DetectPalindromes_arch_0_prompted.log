  - `is_palindrome(self, word: str) -> bool`: Checks if a given word is a palindrome.
  - `extract_words(self, text: str) -> List[str]`: Extracts words from the given text.
  - `find_palindromes(self) -> List[str]`: Finds and returns a list of unique palindromes from the file.

- **main** (function):  
  - Entry point of the program. Reads the file path from the user, creates an instance of `PalindromeDetector`, and prints the detected palindromes.

### Step 2: Implement the files:

### File 1: main.py

main.py

```python
'''
Main executable file for palindrome detection.
'''

from palindrome_detector import PalindromeDetector

def main():
    file_path = input("Enter the path to the text file: ")
    detector = PalindromeDetector(file_path)
    palindromes = detector.find_palindromes()

    if palindromes:
        print("Palindromes found in the file:")
        for palindrome in palindromes:
            print(palindrome)
    else:
        print("No palindromes found in the file.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

### Explanation of the Implementation:

- The `PalindromeDetector` class encapsulates all palindrome detection logic.
- The `is_palindrome` method checks if a word is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.
- The `extract_words` method uses regular expressions to extract words from text, ignoring punctuation and special characters.
- The `find_palindromes` method reads the file line by line, extracts words, checks for palindromes, and stores unique palindromes in a set to avoid duplicates.
- The main executable file (`main.py`) interacts with the user, takes the file path as input, and displays the results clearly.

This implementation is modular, easy to maintain, and meets the user's requirements.

 ### Step 1: Define the core classes, functions, and methods:

- **PalindromeDetector** (class):  
  - `__init__(self, file_path: str)`: Initializes the class with the path of the file to be analyzed.
  - `is_palindrome(self, word: str) -> bool`: Checks if a given word is a palindrome.
  - `extract_words(self, text: str) -> List[str]`: Extracts words from the given text.
  - `find_palindromes(self) -> List[str]`: Finds and returns a list of unique palindromes from the file.

- **main** (function):  
  - Entry point of the program. Reads the file path from the user, creates an instance of `PalindromeDetector`, and prints the detected palindromes.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix.

You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.

To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The code is logically sound and mostly meets the requirements; however, the current implementation prints error messages directly within the `find_palindromes` method but still returns an empty list, causing the main function to misleadingly print "No palindromes found in the file." even when the file does not exist or an unexpected error occurs. This can confuse users about the actual issue.

To fix this, you should clearly distinguish between an empty result due to no palindromes found and an empty result due to file errors. You can achieve this by raising exceptions from the `find_palindromes` method instead of printing errors directly, and then handling these exceptions explicitly in the main function.

Suggested revision:

1. Modify the `find_palindromes` method in `palindrome_detector.py` to raise exceptions instead of printing errors:

```python
def find_palindromes(self) -> List[str]:
    '''
    Finds and returns a sorted list of unique palindromes from the file.
    :return: A sorted list of unique palindromes.
    :raises FileNotFoundError: If the file does not exist.
    :raises Exception: For other unexpected errors.
    '''
    palindromes_set = set()
    with open(self.file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        for line in file:
            words = self.extract_words(line)
            for word in words:
                if self.is_palindrome(word):
                    palindromes_set.add(word.lower())
    return sorted(list(palindromes_set))
```

2. Update the `main` function in `main.py` to handle these exceptions explicitly:

```python
def main():
    file_path = input("Enter the path to the text file: ")
    detector = PalindromeDetector(file_path)
    try:
        palindromes = detector.find_palindromes()
        if palindromes:
            print("\nPalindromes found in the file:")
            for palindrome in palindromes:
                print(f"- {palindrome}")
        else:
            print("\nNo palindromes found in the file.")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"\nError: File '{file_path}' not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\nAn unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

This revision ensures clear and accurate user feedback, distinguishing between genuine absence of palindromes and file-related errors.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is logically sound and mostly meets the requirements; however, the current implementation prints error messages directly within the `find_palindromes` method but still returns an empty list, causing the main function to misleadingly print "No palindromes found in the file." even when the file does not exist or an unexpected error occurs. This can confuse users about the actual issue.

To fix this, you should clearly distinguish between an empty result due to no palindromes found and an empty result due to file errors. You can achieve this by raising exceptions from the `find_palindromes` method instead of printing errors directly, and then handling these exceptions explicitly in the main function.

Suggested revision:

1. Modify the `find_palindromes` method in `palindrome_detector.py` to raise exceptions instead of printing errors:

```python
def find_palindromes(self) -> List[str]:
    '''
    Finds and returns a sorted list of unique palindromes from the file.
    :return: A sorted list of unique palindromes.
    :raises FileNotFoundError: If the file does not exist.
    :raises Exception: For other unexpected errors.
    '''
    palindromes_set = set()
    with open(self.file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        for line in file:
            words = self.extract_words(line)
            for word in words:
                if self.is_palindrome(word):
                    palindromes_set.add(word.lower())
    return sorted(list(palindromes_set))
```

2. Update the `main` function in `main.py` to handle these exceptions explicitly:

```python
def main():
    file_path = input("Enter the path to the text file: ")
    detector = PalindromeDetector(file_path)
    try:
        palindromes = detector.find_palindromes()
        if palindromes:
            print("\nPalindromes found in the file:")
            for palindrome in palindromes:
                print(f"- {palindrome}")
        else:
            print("\nNo palindromes found in the file.")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"\nError: File '{file_path}' not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\nAn unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

This revision ensures clear and accurate user feedback, distinguishing between genuine absence of palindromes and file-related errors."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

however, the current implementation prints error messages directly within the find_palindromes method but still returns an empty list, causing the main function to misleadingly print "No palindromes found in the file." even when the file does not exist or an unexpected error occurs. This can confuse users about the actual issue.\n\nTo fix this, you should clearly distinguish between an empty result due to no palindromes found and an empty result due to file errors. You can achieve this by raising exceptions from the find_palindromes method instead of printing errors directly, and then handling these exceptions explicitly in the main function.\n\nSuggested revision:\n\n1. Modify the find_palindromes method in palindrome_detector.py to raise exceptions instead of printing errors:\n\npython\ndef find_palindromes(self) -&gt; List[str]:\n    \'\'\'\n    Finds and returns a sorted list of unique palindromes from the file.\n    :return: A sorted list of unique palindromes.\n    :raises FileNotFoundError: If the file does not exist.\n    :raises Exception: For other unexpected errors.\n    \'\'\'\n    palindromes_set = set()\n    with open(self.file_path, \'r\', encoding=\'utf-8\') as file:\n        for line in file:\n            words = self.extract_words(line)\n            for word in words:\n                if self.is_palindrome(word):\n                    palindromes_set.add(word.lower())\n    return sorted(list(palindromes_set))\n\n\n2. Update the main function in main.py to handle these exceptions explicitly:\n\npython\ndef main():\n    file_path = input("Enter the path to the text file: ")\n    detector = PalindromeDetector(file_path)\n    try:\n        palindromes = detector.find_palindromes()\n        if palindromes:\n            print("\\nPalindromes found in the file:")\n            for palindrome in palindromes:\n                print(f"- {palindrome}")\n        else:\n            print("\\nNo palindromes found in the file.")\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f"\\nError: File \'{file_path}\' not found.")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f"\\nAn unexpected error occurred: {e}")\n\n\nThis revision ensures clear and accurate user feedback, distinguishing between genuine absence of palindromes and file-related errors.'} |

The current implementation checks palindromes only at the word level, but the user's requirement "develop a program that detects palindromes in a given text file" does not explicitly specify whether palindromes should be detected at the word level or also at the sentence/phrase level. The current logic misses palindrome detection for phrases or sentences, which could be a significant feature expected by the user.

Suggestions on revision:

Clarify with the user if palindrome detection should include phrases or sentences. If phrase/sentence-level palindrome detection is required, implement an additional method to detect palindromes at the sentence or phrase level. For example, you could add a method like:

```python
def is_phrase_palindrome(self, phrase: str) -> bool:
    '''
    Checks if a given phrase or sentence is a palindrome, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case.
    :param phrase: The phrase or sentence to check.
    :return: True if the phrase is a palindrome, False otherwise.
    '''
    cleaned_phrase = re.sub(r'[\W_]', '', phrase.lower())
    return cleaned_phrase == cleaned_phrase[::-1] and len(cleaned_phrase) > 1
```

Then, update the `find_palindromes` method to optionally include phrase-level palindrome detection based on user preference or requirement.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# Palindrome Detector

A simple yet powerful Python application designed to detect palindromes within text files. It supports both word-level and phrase-level palindrome detection, providing users with an easy-to-use interface to analyze text files quickly and efficiently.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Word-Level Palindrome Detection:** Identifies individual words that are palindromes.
- **Phrase-Level Palindrome Detection:** Detects palindromic phrases or sentences, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case sensitivity.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-follow prompts and clear output formatting.
- **No External Dependencies:** Lightweight and easy to set up, requiring only Python.

---

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone or Download the Repository

Clone the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

Alternatively, download and extract the ZIP file from the provided source.

### Install Dependencies

This application does not require any external dependencies. However, it is recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

## 🛠️ Usage

### Running the Application

To run the palindrome detector, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Analyzing a Text File

Upon running the application, you will be prompted to enter the path to the text file you wish to analyze:

```bash
Enter the path to the text file: example.txt
```

Replace `example.txt` with the path to your text file.

### Example Output

If palindromes are detected, the application will display them clearly separated into word-level and phrase-level categories:

```
Word-level palindromes found in the file:
- civic
- level
- radar

Phrase-level palindromes found in the file:
- A man, a plan, a canal, Panama
- Was it a car or a cat I saw
```

If no palindromes are detected, the application will inform you accordingly:

```
No word-level palindromes found in the file.

No phrase-level palindromes found in the file.
```

# Palindrome Detector

A simple yet powerful Python application designed to detect palindromes within text files. It supports both word-level and phrase-level palindrome detection, providing users with an easy-to-use interface to analyze text files quickly and efficiently.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Word-Level Palindrome Detection:** Identifies individual words that are palindromes.
- **Phrase-Level Palindrome Detection:** Detects palindromic phrases or sentences, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case sensitivity.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-follow prompts and clear output formatting.
- **No External Dependencies:** Lightweight and easy to set up, requiring only Python.

---

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone or Download the Repository

Clone the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

Alternatively, download and extract the ZIP file from the provided source.

### Install Dependencies

This application does not require any external dependencies. However, it is recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

## 🛠️ Usage

### Running the Application

To run the palindrome detector, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Analyzing a Text File

Upon running the application, you will be prompted to enter the path to the text file you wish to analyze:

```bash
Enter the path to the text file: example.txt
```

Replace `example.txt` with the path to your text file.

### Example Output

If palindromes are detected, the application will display them clearly separated into word-level and phrase-level categories:

```
Word-level palindromes found in the file:
- civic
- level
- radar

Phrase-level palindromes found in the file:
- A man, a plan, a canal, Panama
- Was it a car or a cat I saw
```

If no palindromes are detected, the application will inform you accordingly:

```
No word-level palindromes found in the file.

No phrase-level palindromes found in the file.
```
