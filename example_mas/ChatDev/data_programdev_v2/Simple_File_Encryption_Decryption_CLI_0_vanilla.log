Given the nature of the task, which is to develop a CLI utility for file encryption and decryption, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task involves creating a software tool that performs specific functions (encryption and decryption) and can be implemented using a programming language like Python. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" is indeed the most appropriate product modality for this task, as it involves developing a functional tool that users can execute from the command line to perform encryption and decryption operations. This aligns well with our expertise in creating software tools.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a CLI utility for simple file encryption and decryption using a symmetric algorithm (e.g., AES with a user-provided password). The tool should take input file, output file, password, and mode (encrypt/decrypt) as arguments..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Develop a CLI utility for simple file encryption and decryption using a symmetric algorithm (e.g., AES with a user-provided password). The tool should take input file, output file, password, and mode (encrypt/decrypt) as arguments.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To develop a CLI utility for file encryption and decryption using AES with a user-provided password, we will create a Python application with a GUI using the `tkinter` framework. The application will consist of several components, including encryption and decryption logic, a GUI for user interaction, and a main file to tie everything together.

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **FileEncryptor**: 
   - **Purpose**: Handles the encryption and decryption of files using AES.
   - **Methods**:
     - `encrypt_file(input_file, output_file, password)`: Encrypts the input file and saves it to the output file.
     - `decrypt_file(input_file, output_file, password)`: Decrypts the input file and saves it to the output file.

2. **GUI**:
   - **Purpose**: Provides a graphical interface for users to interact with the application.
   - **Methods**:
     - `create_main_window()`: Sets up the main window of the application.
     - `on_encrypt()`: Callback for encrypt button.
     - `on_decrypt()`: Callback for decrypt button.

3. **Main**:
   - **Purpose**: Entry point of the application, initializes the GUI.

### File Structure

1. `main.py`: Contains the main entry point and initializes the GUI.
2. `file_encryptor.py`: Contains the `FileEncryptor` class with encryption and decryption logic.
3. `gui.py`: Contains the GUI setup and logic.

Let's implement each file:

#### main.py

```python
'''

Main entry point for the file encryption and decryption application.

'''

from gui import create_main_window

def main():
    create_main_window()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### file_encryptor.py

```python
'''

Handles file encryption and decryption using AES with a user-provided password.

'''

        self.key_size = 32
        self.iterations = 100000
        self.block_size = AES.block_size

    def _derive_key(self, password, salt):
        return PBKDF2(password, salt, dkLen=self.key_size, count=self.iterations)

    def encrypt_file(self, input_file, output_file, password):
        salt = get_random_bytes(self.salt_size)
        key = self._derive_key(password, salt)
        cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_GCM)

        with open(input_file, 'rb') as f:
            plaintext = f.read()

        ciphertext, tag = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(plaintext)

        with open(output_file, 'wb') as f:
            for x in (salt, cipher.nonce, tag, ciphertext):
                f.write(x)

    def decrypt_file(self, input_file, output_file, password):
        with open(input_file, 'rb') as f:
            salt = f.read(self.salt_size)
            nonce = f.read(self.block_size)
            tag = f.read(self.block_size)
            ciphertext = f.read()

        key = self._derive_key(password, salt)
        cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_GCM, nonce=nonce)

        plaintext = cipher.decrypt_and_verify(ciphertext, tag)

        with open(output_file, 'wb') as f:
            f.write(plaintext)
```

#### gui.py

```python
'''

Provides a graphical user interface for the file encryption and decryption application.

'''

import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog, messagebox
from file_encryptor import FileEncryptor

def create_main_window():
    encryptor = FileEncryptor()

    def on_encrypt():

    tk.Button(root, text="Decrypt File", command=on_decrypt).pack(pady=5)

    root.mainloop()
```

This setup provides a simple GUI application for encrypting and decrypting files using AES encryption with a user-provided password. The `tkinter` library is used for the GUI, and the `pycryptodome` library is used for cryptographic operations. Make sure to install `pycryptodome` using `pip install pycryptodome` before running the application.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a CLI utility for simple file encryption and decryption using a symmetric algorithm (e.g., AES with a user-provided password). The tool should take input file, output file, password, and mode (encrypt/decrypt) as arguments..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The current implementation includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for file encryption and decryption, which does not align with the customer's requirement for a command-line interface (CLI) utility. The highest priority is to modify the implementation to provide a CLI interface instead of a GUI.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Remove the GUI Implementation**: Eliminate the `gui.py` file and any references to it in `main.py`.
2. **Implement CLI in `main.py`**: Use Python's `argparse` module to handle command-line arguments for input file, output file, password, and mode (encrypt/decrypt).

Here's a basic example of how you could structure the CLI in `main.py`:

```python
import argparse
from file_encryptor import FileEncryptor

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Encrypt or decrypt files using AES encryption.')
    parser.add_argument('mode', choices=['encrypt', 'decrypt'], help='Mode of operation: encrypt or decrypt')
    parser.add_argument('input_file', help='Path to the input file')
    parser.add_argument('output_file', help='Path to the output file')
    parser.add_argument('password', help='Password for encryption/decryption')

    args = parser.parse_args()

    encryptor = FileEncryptor()

    if args.mode == 'encrypt':
        encryptor.encrypt_file(args.input_file, args.output_file, args.password)
        print("File encrypted successfully!")
    elif args.mode == 'decrypt':
        encryptor.decrypt_file(args.input_file, args.output_file, args.password)
        print("File decrypted successfully!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This change will ensure that the software meets the customer's requirement for a CLI utility.

Comments on Codes:
"The current implementation includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for file encryption and decryption, which does not align with the customer's requirement for a command-line interface (CLI) utility. The highest priority is to modify the implementation to provide a CLI interface instead of a GUI.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Remove the GUI Implementation**: Eliminate the `gui.py` file and any references to it in `main.py`.
2. **Implement CLI in `main.py`**: Use Python's `argparse` module to handle command-line arguments for input file, output file, password, and mode (encrypt/decrypt).

Here's a basic example of how you could structure the CLI in `main.py`:

```python
import argparse
from file_encryptor import FileEncryptor

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Encrypt or decrypt files using AES encryption.')
    parser.add_argument('mode', choices=['encrypt', 'decrypt'], help='Mode of operation: encrypt or decrypt')
    parser.add_argument('input_file', help='Path to the input file')
    parser.add_argument('output_file', help='Path to the output file')
    parser.add_argument('password', help='Password for encryption/decryption')

    args = parser.parse_args()

    encryptor = FileEncryptor()

    if args.mode == 'encrypt':
        encryptor.encrypt_file(args.input_file, args.output_file, args.password)
        print("File encrypted successfully!")
    elif args.mode == 'decrypt':
        encryptor.decrypt_file(args.input_file, args.output_file, args.password)
        print("File decrypted successfully!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This change will ensure that the software meets the customer's requirement for a CLI utility."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a critical issue regarding the security of the password handling and the encryption process. The password is directly used to derive the encryption key without any user feedback or validation, which can lead to weak encryption if the password is not strong enough. Additionally, the GUI part is not necessary for a CLI utility as per the user's task.

**Comment with Highest Priority:**
The password handling and key derivation process should include a mechanism to ensure the password's strength and validity. Additionally, the GUI implementation is not required for a CLI utility and should be removed to align with the user's task.

**Suggestions on Revision:**
1. **Password Validation:** Implement a password strength checker to ensure that the user-provided password is strong enough. This can include checks for minimum length, inclusion of numbers, special characters, etc.

2. **Remove GUI Code:** Since the task specifies a CLI utility, the `gui.py` file and its related code should be removed to keep the project focused on the CLI functionality.

3. **User Feedback:** Consider adding user feedback for password strength in the CLI, possibly by printing a warning if the password is weak.

By addressing these points, the utility will be more secure and better aligned with the user's requirements.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a critical issue regarding the security of the password handling and the encryption process. The password is directly used to derive the encryption key without any user feedback or validation, which can lead to weak encryption if the password is not strong enough. Additionally, the GUI part is not necessary for a CLI utility as per the user's task.

**Comment with Highest Priority:**
The password handling and key derivation process should include a mechanism to ensure the password's strength and validity. Additionally, the GUI implementation is not required for a CLI utility and should be removed to align with the user's task.

**Suggestions on Revision:**
1. **Password Validation:** Implement a password strength checker to ensure that the user-provided password is strong enough. This can include checks for minimum length, inclusion of numbers, special characters, etc.

2. **Remove GUI Code:** Since the task specifies a CLI utility, the `gui.py` file and its related code should be removed to keep the project focused on the CLI functionality.

3. **User Feedback:** Consider adding user feedback for password strength in the CLI, possibly by printing a warning if the password is weak.

By addressing these points, the utility will be more secure and better aligned with the user's requirements."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Additionally, the GUI part is not necessary for a CLI utility as per the user's task.\n\nComment with Highest Priority:\nThe password handling and key derivation process should include a mechanism to ensure the password's strength and validity. Additionally, the GUI implementation is not required for a CLI utility and should be removed to align with the user's task.\n\nSuggestions on Revision:\n1. Password Validation: Implement a password strength checker to ensure that the user-provided password is strong enough. This can include checks for minimum length, inclusion of numbers, special characters, etc.\n\n2. Remove GUI Code: Since the task specifies a CLI utility, the gui.py file and its related code should be removed to keep the project focused on the CLI functionality.\n\n3. User Feedback: Consider adding user feedback for password strength in the CLI, possibly by printing a warning if the password is weak.\n\nBy addressing these points, the utility will be more secure and better aligned with the user's requirements."} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a CLI utility for simple file encryption and decryption using a symmetric algorithm (e.g., AES with a user-provided password). The tool should take input file, output file, password, and mode (encrypt/decrypt) as arguments..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a critical issue regarding the security of the password validation process. The current password validation function only prints a warning if the password is weak but does not enforce a strong password requirement. This could lead to security vulnerabilities if users proceed with weak passwords.

**Comment with Highest Priority:**
The password validation function should enforce strong password requirements instead of merely issuing a warning. This will enhance the security of the encryption process by ensuring that only strong passwords are used.

**Suggested Revision:**
Modify the `validate_password` function to raise an exception or terminate the process if the password does not meet the strength criteria. This will prevent the application from proceeding with weak passwords.

```python
def validate_password(password):
    # Enforce strong password requirements
    if len(password) < 8:
        raise ValueError("Password must be at least 8 characters long.")
    if not any(char.isdigit() for char in password):
        raise ValueError("Password must contain at least one digit.")
    if not any(char.isupper() for char in password):
        raise ValueError("Password must contain at least one uppercase letter.")
    if not any(char.islower() for char in password):
        raise ValueError("Password must contain at least one lowercase letter.")
    if not any(char in "!@#$%^&*()-_+=" for char in password):
        raise ValueError("Password must contain at least one special character.")
    return True
```

Additionally, update the `main` function to handle the exception:

```python
def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Encrypt or decrypt files using AES encryption.')
    parser.add_argument('mode', choices=['encrypt', 'decrypt'], help='Mode of operation: encrypt or decrypt')
    parser.add_argument('input_file', help='Path to the input file')
    parser.add_argument('output_file', help='Path to the output file')
    parser.add_argument('password', help='Password for encryption/decryption')
    args = parser.parse_args()

    try:
        validate_password(args.password)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return

    encryptor = FileEncryptor()
    if args.mode == 'encrypt':
        encryptor.encrypt_file(args.input_file, args.output_file, args.password)
        print("File encrypted successfully!")
    elif args.mode == 'decrypt':
        encryptor.decrypt_file(args.input_file, args.output_file, args.password)
        print("File decrypted successfully!")
```

This change ensures that the application enforces strong password policies, thereby enhancing security.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a critical issue regarding the security of the password validation process. The current password validation function only prints a warning if the password is weak but does not enforce a strong password requirement. This could lead to security vulnerabilities if users proceed with weak passwords.

**Comment with Highest Priority:**
The password validation function should enforce strong password requirements instead of merely issuing a warning. This will enhance the security of the encryption process by ensuring that only strong passwords are used.

**Suggested Revision:**
Modify the `validate_password` function to raise an exception or terminate the process if the password does not meet the strength criteria. This will prevent the application from proceeding with weak passwords.

```python
def validate_password(password):
    # Enforce strong password requirements
    if len(password) < 8:
        raise ValueError("Password must be at least 8 characters long.")
    if not any(char.isdigit() for char in password):
        raise ValueError("Password must contain at least one digit.")
    if not any(char.isupper() for char in password):
        raise ValueError("Password must contain at least one uppercase letter.")
    if not any(char.islower() for char in password):
        raise ValueError("Password must contain at least one lowercase letter.")
    if not any(char in "!@#$%^&*()-_+=" for char in password):
        raise ValueError("Password must contain at least one special character.")
    return True
```

Additionally, update the `main` function to handle the exception:

```python
def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Encrypt or decrypt files using AES encryption.')
    parser.add_argument('mode', choices=['encrypt', 'decrypt'], help='Mode of operation: encrypt or decrypt')
    parser.add_argument('input_file', help='Path to the input file')
    parser.add_argument('output_file', help='Path to the output file')
    parser.add_argument('password', help='Password for encryption/decryption')
    args = parser.parse_args()

    try:
        validate_password(args.password)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return

    encryptor = FileEncryptor()
    if args.mode == 'encrypt':
        encryptor.encrypt_file(args.input_file, args.output_file, args.password)
        print("File encrypted successfully!")
    elif args.mode == 'decrypt':
        encryptor.decrypt_file(args.input_file, args.output_file, args.password)
        print("File decrypted successfully!")
```

This change ensures that the application enforces strong password policies, thereby enhancing security."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To resolve the reported issue, we need to ensure that the `pycryptodome` library, which provides the `Crypto` module, is installed. The error indicates that the `Crypto` module is not found, which suggests that the library might not be installed in the environment where the code is being executed.

Here is the corrected code with an explanation on how to install the required library:

```plaintext
<INFO> Finished
```

**Explanation:**

To fix the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Crypto'`, you need to install the `pycryptodome` library. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install pycryptodome
```

Once the library is installed, the code should execute without the reported error. There are no changes needed in the source code itself, as the issue is related to the environment setup.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code, the main dependency for this project is the `pycryptodome` library, which is used for cryptographic functions. Additionally, since the GUI uses `tkinter`, which is included with Python's standard library, it does not need to be listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Here is the `requirements.txt` file for the project:

```
pycryptodome==3.18.0
```

This file specifies that the project requires version 3.18.0 of the `pycryptodome` library. You can adjust the version number if you need a specific version or range of versions.

You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a CLI utility for simple file encryption and decryption using a symmetric algorithm (e.g., AES with a user-provided password). The tool should take input file, output file, password, and mode (encrypt/decrypt) as arguments..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, the main dependency for this project is the `pycryptodome` library, which is used for cryptographic functions. Additionally, since the GUI uses `tkinter`, which is included with Python's standard library, it does not need to be listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Here is the `requirements.txt` file for the project:
```
pycryptodome==3.18.0
```
This file specifies that the project requires version 3.18.0 of the `pycryptodome` library. You can adjust the version number if you need a specific version or range of versions. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

# File Encryptor CLI Utility

A command-line interface (CLI) utility for simple file encryption and decryption using a symmetric algorithm (AES) with a user-provided password.

## Introduction

The File Encryptor CLI Utility is designed to provide users with a straightforward method to encrypt and decrypt files using the AES encryption algorithm. This tool ensures that your sensitive data remains secure and accessible only to those with the correct password.

## Main Functions

- **Encrypt Files**: Secure your files by encrypting them with a password.
- **Decrypt Files**: Access your encrypted files by decrypting them with the same password used for encryption.

## Installation

### Environment Setup

To use the File Encryptor CLI Utility, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need to install the required dependencies.

### Install Dependencies

1. **Using pip**: 
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary Python package:

   ```bash
   pip install pycryptodome==3.18.0
   ```

2. **Using requirements.txt**:
   Alternatively, you can install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface

The CLI utility can be used to encrypt or decrypt files by providing the necessary arguments.

#### Basic Command Structure

```bash
python main.py <mode> <input_file> <output_file> <password>
```

- `<mode>`: Specify `encrypt` to encrypt a file or `decrypt` to decrypt a file.
- `<input_file>`: Path to the input file you want to encrypt or decrypt.
- `<output_file>`: Path where the output file will be saved.
- `<password>`: Password used for encryption or decryption. Ensure it meets the password requirements.

#### Example Commands
