Given the task is to build a CLI task scheduler, the most suitable product modality would be an Application. This is because the task involves creating a tool that executes commands at specified times, which aligns with the functionality typically provided by a software application. Additionally, since the task requires storing tasks in a text file, this can be efficiently handled within an application framework. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. A CLI task scheduler is best suited as an Application because it involves executing commands and managing tasks programmatically. This aligns well with the capabilities of a software application, which can handle command-line interactions and file operations effectively.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Build a CLI task scheduler that allows users to add tasks with a specific execution time (e.g., HH:MM on a given date). The tool should execute a specified command when the time is reached. Store tasks in a simple text file..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Build a CLI task scheduler that allows users to add tasks with a specific execution time (e.g., HH:MM on a given date). The tool should execute a specified command when the time is reached. Store tasks in a simple text file.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To build a CLI task scheduler with a GUI using Python, we'll use the `tkinter` library for the GUI. The application will allow users to add tasks with specific execution times and store them in a text file. The tasks will be executed at the specified times using Python's `sched` module. Here's a breakdown of the core components:

### Core Components

1. **TaskScheduler**: 
   - **Purpose**: Manage tasks, schedule them, and execute commands at specified times.
   - **Methods**:
     - `add_task(date, time, command)`: Add a new task.
     - `load_tasks()`: Load tasks from a text file.
     - `save_tasks()`: Save tasks to a text file.
     - `execute_task(command)`: Execute the specified command.

2. **Task**:
   - **Purpose**: Represent a single task with a date, time, and command.
   - **Attributes**: `date`, `time`, `command`.

3. **GUI**:
   - **Purpose**: Provide a graphical interface for users to interact with the task scheduler.
   - **Components**:
     - Entry fields for date, time, and command.
     - Buttons to add tasks and view scheduled tasks.

### File Structure

1. `main.py`: The main entry point for the application.
2. `scheduler.py`: Contains the `TaskScheduler` and `Task` classes.
3. `gui.py`: Contains the GUI implementation using `tkinter`.

Let's start with the implementation:

#### main.py

```python
'''

Main entry point for the CLI Task Scheduler application.

'''

from gui import TaskSchedulerGUI

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = TaskSchedulerGUI()
    app.run()
```

#### scheduler.py

```python
'''

        self.tasks = []
        self.load_tasks()

    def add_task(self, date, time_str, command):
        task_time = datetime.strptime(f"{date} {time_str}", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")
        delay = (task_time - datetime.now()).total_seconds()
        if delay > 0:
            self.scheduler.enter(delay, 1, self.execute_task, (command,))
            task = Task(date, time_str, command)

        # subprocess.run(command, shell=True)

    def run(self):

Unimplemented File:

In our software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all methods in the scheduler.py file which contains a unimplemented class. Now, implement all methods of the scheduler.py and all other codes needed, then output the fully implemented codes, strictly following the required format.

Unimplemented File:

In our software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all methods in the scheduler.py file which contains a unimplemented class. Now, implement all methods of the scheduler.py and all other codes needed, then output the fully implemented codes, strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all methods in the  file which contains a unimplemented class. Now, implement all methods of the  and all other codes needed, then output the fully implemented codes, strictly following the required format.

You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Build a CLI task scheduler that allows users to add tasks with a specific execution time (e.g., HH:MM on a given date). The tool should execute a specified command when the time is reached. Store tasks in a simple text file..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

It seems there is a misunderstanding in the task description. The provided code already implements a CLI task scheduler with a GUI using Python's `tkinter`. However, the task specifically asks for a CLI (Command Line Interface) application, not a GUI application. Therefore, I will adjust the implementation to focus solely on a CLI-based task scheduler.

Here is the revised implementation:

### main.py
```python

def main():
    scheduler = TaskScheduler()
    while True:

        print("2. Exit")
        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")
        if choice == '1':
            date = input("Enter date (YYYY-MM-DD): ")
            time_str = input("Enter time (HH:MM): ")
            command = input("Enter command: ")
            scheduler.add_task(date, time_str, command)
            print("Task added successfully!")
        elif choice == '2':
            print("Exiting...")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### scheduler.py

This implementation focuses on a CLI-based task scheduler, allowing users to add tasks via the command line. The `main.py` file provides a simple menu for adding tasks and exiting the application. The `scheduler.py` file manages the scheduling and execution of tasks, storing them in a text file.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Build a CLI task scheduler that allows users to add tasks with a specific execution time (e.g., HH:MM on a given date). The tool should execute a specified command when the time is reached. Store tasks in a simple text file..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The highest priority issue in the provided code is that the `TaskScheduler` class in `scheduler.py` does not automatically start executing scheduled tasks. The `run` method of the `TaskScheduler` class, which is responsible for running the scheduler, is not called anywhere in the `main.py` or `gui.py`. This means that even though tasks are added, they will not be executed at the specified time.

To fix this, you should ensure that the `run` method of the `TaskScheduler` is called to start the scheduler. Here is how you can fix it:

1. In `main.py`, after adding a task, call `scheduler.run()` in a separate thread to allow the CLI to remain responsive:

```python
import threading

def main():
    scheduler = TaskScheduler()
    threading.Thread(target=scheduler.run, daemon=True).start()  # Start the scheduler in a separate thread
    while True:
        print("\nTask Scheduler CLI")
        print("1. Add Task")
        print("2. Exit")
        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")
        if choice == '1':
            date = input("Enter date (YYYY-MM-DD): ")
            time_str = input("Enter time (HH:MM): ")
            command = input("Enter command: ")
            scheduler.add_task(date, time_str, command)
            print("Task added successfully!")
        elif choice == '2':
            print("Exiting...")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
```

2. In `gui.py`, similarly, start the scheduler in a separate thread when initializing the GUI:

```python
import threading

class TaskSchedulerGUI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scheduler = TaskScheduler()
        threading.Thread(target=self.scheduler.run, daemon=True).start()  # Start the scheduler in a separate thread
        self.root = tk.Tk()
        self.root.title("Task Scheduler")
        # ... rest of the code ...
```

By implementing these changes, the scheduler will continuously run in the background, allowing tasks to be executed at their scheduled times.

        if choice == '1':
            date = input("Enter date (YYYY-MM-DD): ")
            time_str = input("Enter time (HH:MM): ")
            command = input("Enter command: ")
            scheduler.add_task(date, time_str, command)
            print("Task added successfully!")
        elif choice == '2':
            print("Exiting...")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
```

2. In `gui.py`, similarly, start the scheduler in a separate thread when initializing the GUI:

```python
import threading

class TaskSchedulerGUI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scheduler = TaskScheduler()
        threading.Thread(target=self.scheduler.run, daemon=True).start()  # Start the scheduler in a separate thread
        self.root = tk.Tk()
        self.root.title("Task Scheduler")
        # ... rest of the code ...
```

By implementing these changes, the scheduler will continuously run in the background, allowing tasks to be executed at their scheduled times.

Comments on Codes:
"The highest priority issue in the provided code is that the `TaskScheduler` class in `scheduler.py` does not automatically start executing scheduled tasks. The `run` method of the `TaskScheduler` class, which is responsible for running the scheduler, is not called anywhere in the `main.py` or `gui.py`. This means that even though tasks are added, they will not be executed at the specified time.

To fix this, you should ensure that the `run` method of the `TaskScheduler` is called to start the scheduler. Here is how you can fix it:

1. In `main.py`, after adding a task, call `scheduler.run()` in a separate thread to allow the CLI to remain responsive:

```python
import threading

def main():
    scheduler = TaskScheduler()
    threading.Thread(target=scheduler.run, daemon=True).start()  # Start the scheduler in a separate thread
    while True:
        print("\nTask Scheduler CLI")
        print("1. Add Task")
        print("2. Exit")
        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")
        if choice == '1':
            date = input("Enter date (YYYY-MM-DD): ")
            time_str = input("Enter time (HH:MM): ")
            command = input("Enter command: ")
            scheduler.add_task(date, time_str, command)
            print("Task added successfully!")
        elif choice == '2':
            print("Exiting...")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
```

2. In `gui.py`, similarly, start the scheduler in a separate thread when initializing the GUI:

```python
import threading

class TaskSchedulerGUI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scheduler = TaskScheduler()
        threading.Thread(target=self.scheduler.run, daemon=True).start()  # Start the scheduler in a separate thread
        self.root = tk.Tk()
        self.root.title("Task Scheduler")
        # ... rest of the code ...
```

By implementing these changes, the scheduler will continuously run in the background, allowing tasks to be executed at their scheduled times."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

The run method of the TaskScheduler class, which is responsible for running the scheduler, is not called anywhere in the main.py or gui.py. This means that even though tasks are added, they will not be executed at the specified time.\n\nTo fix this, you should ensure that the run method of the TaskScheduler is called to start the scheduler. Here is how you can fix it:\n\n1. In main.py, after adding a task, call scheduler.run() in a separate thread to allow the CLI to remain responsive:\n\npython\nimport threading\n\ndef main():\n    scheduler = TaskScheduler()\n    threading.Thread(target=scheduler.run, daemon=True).start()  # Start the scheduler in a separate thread\n    while True:\n        print("\\nTask Scheduler CLI")\n        print("1. Add Task")\n        print("2. Exit")\n        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")\n        if choice == \'1\':\n            date = input("Enter date (YYYY-MM-DD): ")\n            time_str = input("Enter time (HH:MM): ")\n            command = input("Enter command: ")\n            scheduler.add_task(date, time_str, command)\n            print("Task added successfully!")\n        elif choice == \'2\':\n            print("Exiting...")\n            break\n        else:\n            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")\n\n\n2. In gui.py, similarly, start the scheduler in a separate thread when initializing the GUI:\n\npython\nimport threading\n\nclass TaskSchedulerGUI:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.scheduler = TaskScheduler()\n        threading.Thread(target=self.scheduler.run, daemon=True).start()  # Start the scheduler in a separate thread\n        self.root = tk.Tk()\n        self.root.title("Task Scheduler")\n        # ... rest of the code ...\n\n\nBy implementing these changes, the scheduler will continuously run in the background, allowing tasks to be executed at their scheduled times.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The highest priority issue in the code is that the `load_tasks` method in `scheduler.py` attempts to add tasks from the file without checking if the scheduled time has already passed. This can lead to tasks being scheduled for execution in the past, which will not be executed. 

To fix this, modify the `load_tasks` method to check if the task time is in the future before adding it to the scheduler:

```python
def load_tasks(self):
    try:
        with open("tasks.txt", "r") as file:
            for line in file:
                date, time_str, command = line.strip().split(',')
                task_time = datetime.strptime(f"{date} {time_str}", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")
                if task_time > datetime.now():
                    self.add_task(date, time_str, command)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        pass
```

This ensures that only tasks scheduled for the future are loaded and executed.

Comments on Codes:
"The highest priority issue in the code is that the `load_tasks` method in `scheduler.py` attempts to add tasks from the file without checking if the scheduled time has already passed. This can lead to tasks being scheduled for execution in the past, which will not be executed. 

To fix this, modify the `load_tasks` method to check if the task time is in the future before adding it to the scheduler:

```python
def load_tasks(self):
    try:
        with open("tasks.txt", "r") as file:
            for line in file:
                date, time_str, command = line.strip().split(',')
                task_time = datetime.strptime(f"{date} {time_str}", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")
                if task_time > datetime.now():
                    self.add_task(date, time_str, command)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        pass
```

This ensures that only tasks scheduled for the future are loaded and executed."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Build a CLI task scheduler that allows users to add tasks with a specific execution time (e.g., HH:MM on a given date). The tool should execute a specified command when the time is reached. Store tasks in a simple text file..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The highest priority issue in the code is the lack of synchronization between the task scheduler and the task execution, which can lead to tasks not being executed if the program is closed and reopened. The current implementation does not persistently store the scheduled tasks in a way that ensures they will be executed after a restart. 

To fix this, you should modify the `load_tasks` method to schedule tasks that are still pending execution when the program starts. Currently, it only adds tasks to the list but does not schedule them for execution if the program is restarted. Here's how you can address this:

1. **Modify the `load_tasks` method** to schedule tasks that are still pending execution:

```python
def load_tasks(self):
    try:
        with open("tasks.txt", "r") as file:
            for line in file:
                date, time_str, command = line.strip().split(',')
                task_time = datetime.strptime(f"{date} {time_str}", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")
                delay = (task_time - datetime.now()).total_seconds()
                if delay > 0:
                    self.scheduler.enter(delay, 1, self.execute_task, (command,))
                    task = Task(date, time_str, command)
                    self.tasks.append(task)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        pass
```

This change ensures that tasks are scheduled for execution if they are still valid when the program is restarted.

Comments on Codes:
"The highest priority issue in the code is the lack of synchronization between the task scheduler and the task execution, which can lead to tasks not being executed if the program is closed and reopened. The current implementation does not persistently store the scheduled tasks in a way that ensures they will be executed after a restart. 

To fix this, you should modify the `load_tasks` method to schedule tasks that are still pending execution when the program starts. Currently, it only adds tasks to the list but does not schedule them for execution if the program is restarted. Here's how you can address this:

1. **Modify the `load_tasks` method** to schedule tasks that are still pending execution:

```python
def load_tasks(self):
    try:
        with open("tasks.txt", "r") as file:
            for line in file:
                date, time_str, command = line.strip().split(',')
                task_time = datetime.strptime(f"{date} {time_str}", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")
                delay = (task_time - datetime.now()).total_seconds()
                if delay > 0:
                    self.scheduler.enter(delay, 1, self.execute_task, (command,))
                    task = Task(date, time_str, command)
                    self.tasks.append(task)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        pass
```

This change ensures that tasks are scheduled for execution if they are still valid when the program is restarted."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Build a CLI task scheduler that allows users to add tasks with a specific execution time (e.g., HH:MM on a given date). The tool should execute a specified command when the time is reached. Store tasks in a simple text file..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code, the project uses the `tkinter` library for the GUI and `subprocess` for executing commands. However, `tkinter` is part of the standard Python library and does not need to be included in the `requirements.txt` file. The `subprocess` module is also part of the standard library. Therefore, the only external library used is `sched`, which is also part of the standard library.

Since no additional external libraries are used in the code, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty. However, if you plan to expand the project or use additional libraries in the future, you can add them to this file.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

If you plan to use any specific version of Python, you might want to document that as well, although it's not typically included in `requirements.txt`.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, the project uses the `tkinter` library for the GUI and `subprocess` for executing commands. However, `tkinter` is part of the standard Python library and does not need to be included in the `requirements.txt` file. The `subprocess` module is also part of the standard library. Therefore, the only external library used is `sched`, which is also part of the standard library.
Since no additional external libraries are used in the code, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty. However, if you plan to expand the project or use additional libraries in the future, you can add them to this file.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```

If you plan to use any specific version of Python, you might want to document that as well, although it's not typically included in `requirements.txt`.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

# Task Scheduler CLI and GUI Application

Welcome to the Task Scheduler CLI and GUI application! This software allows users to schedule tasks to be executed at a specific time and date. The tasks are stored in a simple text file for persistence. This manual will guide you through the main functions of the software, how to install it, and how to use it effectively.

## Main Functions

The Task Scheduler application provides the following main functions:

1. **Add Task**: Users can add tasks specifying the date, time, and command to be executed.
2. **Execute Command**: The application will automatically execute the specified command at the scheduled time.
3. **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in a text file (`tasks.txt`) to ensure they are not lost between sessions.
4. **CLI Interface**: A command-line interface for users who prefer terminal-based interaction.
5. **GUI Interface**: A graphical user interface built with Tkinter for users who prefer a visual interaction.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x must be installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your directory to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: There are no external dependencies required for this project, as specified in the `requirements.txt` file. However, ensure that Python's standard libraries are available.

## Usage

### CLI Interface

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the following command in your terminal to start the CLI application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Add a Task**: Follow the on-screen instructions to add a task. You will be prompted to enter the date (YYYY-MM-DD), time (HH:MM), and the command to be executed.

3. **Exit the Application**: Choose the option to exit when you are done adding tasks.

### GUI Interface

1. **Run the GUI Application**: Execute the following command in your terminal to start the GUI application:
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

2. **Add a Task**: Enter the date, time, and command in the respective fields and click the "Add Task" button. A message box will confirm the successful addition of the task.

3. **Close the Application**: Simply close the window when you are finished.

## Additional Information

- **Task Execution**: The application uses Python's `sched` module to schedule tasks and `subprocess` to execute commands.
- **Task Storage**: Tasks are stored in a `tasks.txt` file in the format `date,time,command`.
- **Threading**: The scheduler runs in a separate thread to allow continuous interaction with the user interface.

We hope this manual helps you effectively use the Task Scheduler application. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, please feel free to reach out for support.
