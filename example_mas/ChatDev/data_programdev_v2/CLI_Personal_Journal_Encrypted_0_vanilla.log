Given the customer's request for a CLI personal journal application, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application" since it involves implementing a software tool that can handle command-line operations, encryption, and file storage. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree. An "Application" is indeed the most appropriate modality for a CLI personal journal, as it allows us to implement the necessary functionalities such as command-line interaction, encryption, and local file storage.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a CLI personal journal application. Entries are timestamped and can be encrypted with a user-provided password. Store entries in a local file..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Develop a CLI personal journal application. Entries are timestamped and can be encrypted with a user-provided password. Store entries in a local file.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python *"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python *. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To develop a CLI personal journal application with encryption and timestamping features, we'll use Python. Since the task requires a CLI application, we won't be implementing a GUI. Instead, we'll focus on creating a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the application.

Here's a breakdown of the core components:

1. **JournalEntry Class**: 
   - Purpose: To represent a single journal entry with a timestamp, content, and encryption capabilities.
   - Methods:
     - `__init__`: Initialize the entry with content and timestamp.
     - `encrypt`: Encrypt the entry content with a user-provided password.
     - `decrypt`: Decrypt the entry content with a user-provided password.

2. **Journal Class**:
   - Purpose: To manage multiple journal entries, including adding, saving, and loading entries.
   - Methods:
     - `__init__`: Initialize the journal with an optional file path.
     - `add_entry`: Add a new entry to the journal.
     - `save_entries`: Save all entries to a local file.
     - `load_entries`: Load entries from a local file.

3. **Encryption Utilities**:
   - Purpose: To provide encryption and decryption functionalities.
   - Functions:
     - `encrypt_text`: Encrypt text using a password.
     - `decrypt_text`: Decrypt text using a password.

4. **Main Application**:
   - Purpose: To provide a command-line interface for interacting with the journal.
   - Functions:
     - `main`: The main function to run the application.

Let's start with the implementation:

### journal_entry.py

```python
'''

This module defines the JournalEntry class for managing individual journal entries with encryption capabilities.

'''

from datetime import datetime
from encryption_utils import encrypt_text, decrypt_text

class JournalEntry:
    def __init__(self, content, timestamp=None):
        self.content = content
        self.timestamp = timestamp or datetime.now()

    def encrypt(self, password):
        self.content = encrypt_text(self.content, password)

    def decrypt(self, password):
        self.content = decrypt_text(self.content, password)
```

### journal.py

```python
'''

This module defines the Journal class for managing a collection of journal entries.

'''

import json
from journal_entry import JournalEntry

class Journal:
    def __init__(self, file_path='journal.json'):
        self.entries = []
        self.file_path = file_path

    def add_entry(self, content, password):
        entry = JournalEntry(content)
        entry.encrypt(password)
        self.entries.append(entry)

    def save_entries(self):
        with open(self.file_path, 'w') as file:
            json.dump([{'content': entry.content, 'timestamp': entry.timestamp.isoformat()} for entry in self.entries], file)

    def load_entries(self, password):
        try:
            with open(self.file_path, 'r') as file:
                entries_data = json.load(file)
                for entry_data in entries_data:
                    entry = JournalEntry(entry_data['content'], datetime.fromisoformat(entry_data['timestamp']))
                    entry.decrypt(password)
                    self.entries.append(entry)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print("No existing journal file found. Starting a new journal.")
```

### encryption_utils.py

```python
'''

This module provides utility functions for encrypting and decrypting text.

'''

from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
import base64
import hashlib

def generate_key(password):
    return base64.urlsafe_b64encode(hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).digest())

def encrypt_text(text, password):
    key = generate_key(password)
    fernet = Fernet(key)
    return fernet.encrypt(text.encode()).decode()

def decrypt_text(encrypted_text, password):
    key = generate_key(password)
    fernet = Fernet(key)
    return fernet.decrypt(encrypted_text.encode()).decode()
```

### main.py

```python
'''

This is the main module for running the CLI personal journal application.

'''

from journal import Journal

def main():
    journal = Journal()
    password = input("Enter your journal password: ")

    while True:
        print("\n1. Add Entry\n2. View Entries\n3. Save Entries\n4. Load Entries\n5. Exit")
        choice = input("Choose an option: ")

        if choice == '1':
            content = input("Enter your journal entry: ")
            journal.add_entry(content, password)
        elif choice == '2':
            for entry in journal.entries:
                print(f"{entry.timestamp}: {entry.content}")
        elif choice == '3':
            journal.save_entries()
            print("Entries saved.")
        elif choice == '4':
            journal.load_entries(password)
            print("Entries loaded.")
        elif choice == '5':
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This implementation provides a simple CLI journal application with encryption capabilities. Users can add, view, save, and load journal entries, with each entry being encrypted using a user-provided password.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The highest priority issue in the code is the use of the `cryptography.fernet.Fernet` class for encryption with a key derived from a password using SHA-256 hashing. Fernet requires a 32-byte key, and directly using a SHA-256 hash of a password as a key is not secure. Instead, a key derivation function (KDF) like PBKDF2HMAC should be used to derive a secure key from the password.

### Suggested Revision:
1. Modify the `generate_key` function in `encryption_utils.py` to use `PBKDF2HMAC` for key derivation.

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2 import PBKDF2HMAC
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend

def generate_key(password, salt=b'some_salt', iterations=100000):
    kdf = PBKDF2HMAC(
        algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
        length=32,
        salt=salt,
        iterations=iterations,
        backend=default_backend()
    )
    return base64.urlsafe_b64encode(kdf.derive(password.encode()))
```

2. Update the `encrypt_text` and `decrypt_text` functions to use the revised `generate_key` function.

This change will enhance the security of the encryption process by using a more robust method for key derivation.

Comments on Codes:
"The highest priority issue in the code is the use of the `cryptography.fernet.Fernet` class for encryption with a key derived from a password using SHA-256 hashing. Fernet requires a 32-byte key, and directly using a SHA-256 hash of a password as a key is not secure. Instead, a key derivation function (KDF) like PBKDF2HMAC should be used to derive a secure key from the password.

### Suggested Revision:
1. Modify the `generate_key` function in `encryption_utils.py` to use `PBKDF2HMAC` for key derivation.

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2 import PBKDF2HMAC
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend

def generate_key(password, salt=b'some_salt', iterations=100000):
    kdf = PBKDF2HMAC(
        algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
        length=32,
        salt=salt,
        iterations=iterations,
        backend=default_backend()
    )
    return base64.urlsafe_b64encode(kdf.derive(password.encode()))
```

2. Update the `encrypt_text` and `decrypt_text` functions to use the revised `generate_key` function.

This change will enhance the security of the encryption process by using a more robust method for key derivation."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a CLI personal journal application. Entries are timestamped and can be encrypted with a user-provided password. Store entries in a local file..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The highest priority comment is regarding the security of the encryption process. The current implementation uses a hardcoded salt (`b'some_salt'`) in the `generate_key` function, which can compromise the security of the encryption. Each user should have a unique salt to ensure the security of their encrypted data.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
1. Modify the `generate_key` function to accept a unique salt for each user. This salt can be generated and stored securely when the journal is first created.
2. Update the `Journal` class to handle the generation and storage of a unique salt for each journal file. The salt should be stored in the same file as the entries, but separate from the encrypted data.

Here's how you can modify the `generate_key` function and the `Journal` class:

```python
# encryption_utils.py
def generate_key(password, salt, iterations=100000):
    kdf = PBKDF2HMAC(
        algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
        length=32,
        salt=salt,
        iterations=iterations,
        backend=default_backend()
    )
    return base64.urlsafe_b64encode(kdf.derive(password.encode()))

# journal.py
import os
import base64

class Journal:
    def __init__(self, file_path='journal.json'):
        self.entries = []
        self.file_path = file_path
        self.salt = None
        self.load_salt()

    def load_salt(self):
        if os.path.exists(self.file_path):
            with open(self.file_path, 'r') as file:
                data = json.load(file)
                self.salt = base64.b64decode(data.get('salt', ''))
        else:
            self.salt = os.urandom(16)  # Generate a new salt
            self.save_salt()

    def save_salt(self):
        with open(self.file_path, 'w') as file:
            json.dump({'salt': base64.b64encode(self.salt).decode()}, file)

    def add_entry(self, content, password):
        entry = JournalEntry(content)
        entry.encrypt(password, self.salt)
        self.entries.append(entry)

    def save_entries(self):
        with open(self.file_path, 'w') as file:
            json.dump({
                'salt': base64.b64encode(self.salt).decode(),
                'entries': [{'content': entry.content, 'timestamp': entry.timestamp.isoformat()} for entry in self.entries]
            }, file)

    def load_entries(self, password):
        try:
            with open(self.file_path, 'r') as file:
                data = json.load(file)
                self.salt = base64.b64decode(data['salt'])
                entries_data = data['entries']
                for entry_data in entries_data:
                    entry = JournalEntry(entry_data['content'], datetime.fromisoformat(entry_data['timestamp']))
                    entry.decrypt(password, self.salt)
                    self.entries.append(entry)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print("No existing journal file found. Starting a new journal.")
```

Make sure to update the `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods in the `JournalEntry` class to accept the salt as an argument. This change will enhance the security of the encryption process by ensuring each journal has a unique salt.

Make sure to update the `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods in the `JournalEntry` class to accept the salt as an argument. This change will enhance the security of the encryption process by ensuring each journal has a unique salt.

Comments on Codes:
"The highest priority comment is regarding the security of the encryption process. The current implementation uses a hardcoded salt (`b'some_salt'`) in the `generate_key` function, which can compromise the security of the encryption. Each user should have a unique salt to ensure the security of their encrypted data.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
1. Modify the `generate_key` function to accept a unique salt for each user. This salt can be generated and stored securely when the journal is first created.
2. Update the `Journal` class to handle the generation and storage of a unique salt for each journal file. The salt should be stored in the same file as the entries, but separate from the encrypted data.

Here's how you can modify the `generate_key` function and the `Journal` class:

```python
# encryption_utils.py
def generate_key(password, salt, iterations=100000):
    kdf = PBKDF2HMAC(
        algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
        length=32,
        salt=salt,
        iterations=iterations,
        backend=default_backend()
    )
    return base64.urlsafe_b64encode(kdf.derive(password.encode()))

# journal.py
import os
import base64

class Journal:
    def __init__(self, file_path='journal.json'):
        self.entries = []
        self.file_path = file_path
        self.salt = None
        self.load_salt()

    def load_salt(self):
        if os.path.exists(self.file_path):
            with open(self.file_path, 'r') as file:
                data = json.load(file)
                self.salt = base64.b64decode(data.get('salt', ''))
        else:
            self.salt = os.urandom(16)  # Generate a new salt
            self.save_salt()

    def save_salt(self):
        with open(self.file_path, 'w') as file:
            json.dump({'salt': base64.b64encode(self.salt).decode()}, file)

    def add_entry(self, content, password):
        entry = JournalEntry(content)
        entry.encrypt(password, self.salt)
        self.entries.append(entry)

    def save_entries(self):
        with open(self.file_path, 'w') as file:
            json.dump({
                'salt': base64.b64encode(self.salt).decode(),
                'entries': [{'content': entry.content, 'timestamp': entry.timestamp.isoformat()} for entry in self.entries]
            }, file)

    def load_entries(self, password):
        try:
            with open(self.file_path, 'r') as file:
                data = json.load(file)
                self.salt = base64.b64decode(data['salt'])
                entries_data = data['entries']
                for entry_data in entries_data:
                    entry = JournalEntry(entry_data['content'], datetime.fromisoformat(entry_data['timestamp']))
                    entry.decrypt(password, self.salt)
                    self.entries.append(entry)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print("No existing journal file found. Starting a new journal.")
```

Make sure to update the `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods in the `JournalEntry` class to accept the salt as an argument. This change will enhance the security of the encryption process by ensuring each journal has a unique salt."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a CLI personal journal application. Entries are timestamped and can be encrypted with a user-provided password. Store entries in a local file..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The highest priority issue in the provided code is related to the handling of the journal file. The `save_salt` method in the `Journal` class overwrites the entire journal file with only the salt information, which results in the loss of all journal entries whenever the salt is saved. This is a critical issue as it leads to data loss.

### Suggested Revision:
1. Modify the `save_salt` method to ensure it does not overwrite the entire file but only updates the salt information. This can be achieved by reading the existing entries, updating the salt, and then writing back the entire data.

2. Ensure that the `save_entries` method correctly saves both the salt and the entries together.

Here is how you can fix it:

```python
def save_salt(self):
    # Load existing entries if any
    entries_data = []
    if os.path.exists(self.file_path):
        with open(self.file_path, 'r') as file:
            data = json.load(file)
            entries_data = data.get('entries', [])
    
    # Save both salt and entries
    with open(self.file_path, 'w') as file:
        json.dump({
            'salt': base64.b64encode(self.salt).decode(),
            'entries': entries_data
        }, file)
```

Ensure that the `save_entries` method is called after adding new entries to maintain data integrity. This will prevent overwriting the journal file with only the salt and ensure that all entries are preserved.

Comments on Codes:
"The highest priority issue in the provided code is related to the handling of the journal file. The `save_salt` method in the `Journal` class overwrites the entire journal file with only the salt information, which results in the loss of all journal entries whenever the salt is saved. This is a critical issue as it leads to data loss.

### Suggested Revision:
1. Modify the `save_salt` method to ensure it does not overwrite the entire file but only updates the salt information. This can be achieved by reading the existing entries, updating the salt, and then writing back the entire data.

2. Ensure that the `save_entries` method correctly saves both the salt and the entries together.

Here is how you can fix it:

```python
def save_salt(self):
    # Load existing entries if any
    entries_data = []
    if os.path.exists(self.file_path):
        with open(self.file_path, 'r') as file:
            data = json.load(file)
            entries_data = data.get('entries', [])
    
    # Save both salt and entries
    with open(self.file_path, 'w') as file:
        json.dump({
            'salt': base64.b64encode(self.salt).decode(),
            'entries': entries_data
        }, file)
```

Ensure that the `save_entries` method is called after adding new entries to maintain data integrity. This will prevent overwriting the journal file with only the salt and ensure that all entries are preserved."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# CLI Personal Journal Application

This application is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed for personal journaling. It allows users to create, encrypt, and store journal entries locally. Each entry is timestamped and can be encrypted with a user-provided password to ensure privacy.

## Main Functions

1. **Add Entry**: Create a new journal entry. The entry is automatically timestamped and encrypted using a password provided by the user.
2. **View Entries**: Display all journal entries. Entries are decrypted using the user's password before being displayed.
3. **Save Entries**: Save all current journal entries to a local file (`journal.json`). This file includes encrypted entries and a salt used for encryption.
4. **Load Entries**: Load journal entries from the local file. Entries are decrypted using the user's password.
5. **Exit**: Exit the application.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install the `cryptography` package, which is necessary for encrypting and decrypting journal entries.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**

   Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file and run the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Enter Your Password**

   When prompted, enter a password that will be used to encrypt and decrypt your journal entries. Remember this password, as it is required to view and load your entries.

3. **Choose an Option**

   The application will present you with a menu of options:

   - **1. Add Entry**: Enter your journal entry text. The entry will be encrypted and stored in memory.
   - **2. View Entries**: View all entries currently in memory. Entries will be decrypted using your password.
   - **3. Save Entries**: Save all entries to the `journal.json` file.
   - **4. Load Entries**: Load entries from the `journal.json` file. Entries will be decrypted using your password.
   - **5. Exit**: Exit the application.

4. **Exit the Application**

   Select option 5 to exit the application. Ensure you save your entries before exiting to avoid losing any data.

## Security Note

- The application uses a password-based encryption mechanism to secure your journal entries. Ensure that your password is strong and kept confidential.
- The `journal.json` file contains encrypted entries and should be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.
