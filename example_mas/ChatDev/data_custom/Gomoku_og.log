Given the task of developing a standard Gomoku game, I believe the most suitable product modality would be an Application. This would allow us to implement the visualized game effectively using Python, providing an interactive experience for users. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Develop a standard Gomoku game.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a standard Gomoku game..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To develop a standard Gomoku game in Python with a graphical user interface (GUI), we will use the Pygame library. Pygame is suitable for creating games and provides the necessary tools to handle graphics, events, and user interactions.

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **Game**: This class will manage the overall game logic, including initializing the game, handling turns, checking for a win condition, and resetting the game.
   - `__init__()`: Initialize game variables.
   - `reset_game()`: Reset the game to its initial state.
   - `check_winner()`: Check if there is a winner.
   - `make_move(x, y)`: Make a move on the board.

2. **Board**: This class will handle the game board's state and rendering.
   - `__init__()`: Initialize the board.
   - `draw_board(screen)`: Draw the board on the screen.
   - `update_board(x, y, player)`: Update the board with the player's move.

3. **Player**: This class will represent a player in the game.
   - `__init__(name, symbol)`: Initialize player with a name and symbol.

4. **main()**: The main function to run the game loop, handle events, and update the display.

### File Structure

1. `gomoku.py`: Main file to run the game.
2. `game.py`: Contains the `Game` class.
3. `board.py`: Contains the `Board` class.
4. `player.py`: Contains the `Player` class.

Let's start with the implementation:

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a standard Gomoku game..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and follows the task requirements. However, there is a critical issue regarding the `check_winner` method in the `Board` class. The current implementation checks for a winner but does not account for the possibility of a draw, where the board is full, and no player has won. This is an essential feature for a complete Gomoku game.

**Comment with the highest priority:**
The `check_winner` method in the `Board` class should be enhanced to detect a draw condition when the board is full, and no player has won. This ensures that the game can correctly identify when no more moves are possible, and the game ends in a draw.

**Suggestions on revision:**
1. Modify the `check_winner` method to include a check for a full board.
2. Add a method `is_full` in the `Board` class to determine if the board is completely filled.
3. Update the `Game` class to handle the draw condition appropriately.

Here's how you can implement these changes:

```python
# In board.py
class Board:
    # ... existing methods ...

    def is_full(self):
        for row in self.grid:
            if '' in row:
                return False
        return True

    def check_winner(self):
        # Check horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines for a winner
        for y in range(self.size):
            for x in range(self.size):
                if self.grid[y][x] and self.check_line(x, y):
                    return self.grid[y][x]
        # Check for draw
        if self.is_full():
            return "Draw"
        return None

# In game.py
class Game:
    # ... existing methods ...

    def draw(self, screen):
        self.board.draw_board(screen)
        if self.winner:
            font = pygame.font.Font(None, 74)
            if self.winner == "Draw":
                text = font.render("It's a draw!", True, (0, 0, 0))
            else:
                text = font.render(f"{self.winner} wins!", True, (0, 0, 0))
            screen.blit(text, (150, 250))
```

Implement these changes to ensure the game correctly handles all possible outcomes, including a draw.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is mostly well-structured and follows the task requirements. However, there is a critical issue regarding the `check_winner` method in the `Board` class. The current implementation checks for a winner but does not account for the possibility of a draw, where the board is full, and no player has won. This is an essential feature for a complete Gomoku game.

**Comment with the highest priority:**
The `check_winner` method in the `Board` class should be enhanced to detect a draw condition when the board is full, and no player has won. This ensures that the game can correctly identify when no more moves are possible, and the game ends in a draw.

**Suggestions on revision:**
1. Modify the `check_winner` method to include a check for a full board.
2. Add a method `is_full` in the `Board` class to determine if the board is completely filled.
3. Update the `Game` class to handle the draw condition appropriately.

Here's how you can implement these changes:

```python
# In board.py
class Board:
    # ... existing methods ...

    def is_full(self):
        for row in self.grid:
            if '' in row:
                return False
        return True

    def check_winner(self):
        # Check horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines for a winner
        for y in range(self.size):
            for x in range(self.size):
                if self.grid[y][x] and self.check_line(x, y):
                    return self.grid[y][x]
        # Check for draw
        if self.is_full():
            return "Draw"
        return None

# In game.py
class Game:
    # ... existing methods ...

    def draw(self, screen):
        self.board.draw_board(screen)
        if self.winner:
            font = pygame.font.Font(None, 74)
            if self.winner == "Draw":
                text = font.render("It's a draw!", True, (0, 0, 0))
            else:
                text = font.render(f"{self.winner} wins!", True, (0, 0, 0))
            screen.blit(text, (150, 250))
```

Implement these changes to ensure the game correctly handles all possible outcomes, including a draw."

However, there is a critical issue regarding the check_winner method in the Board class. The current implementation checks for a winner but does not account for the possibility of a draw, where the board is full, and no player has won. This is an essential feature for a complete Gomoku game.\n\nComment with the highest priority:\nThe check_winner method in the Board class should be enhanced to detect a draw condition when the board is full, and no player has won. This ensures that the game can correctly identify when no more moves are possible, and the game ends in a draw.\n\nSuggestions on revision:\n1. Modify the check_winner method to include a check for a full board.\n2. Add a method is_full in the Board class to determine if the board is completely filled.\n3. Update the Game class to handle the draw condition appropriately.\n\nHere\'s how you can implement these changes:\n\npython\n# In board.py\nclass Board:\n    # ... existing methods ...\n\n    def is_full(self):\n        for row in self.grid:\n            if \'\' in row:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def check_winner(self):\n        # Check horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines for a winner\n        for y in range(self.size):\n            for x in range(self.size):\n                if self.grid[y][x] and self.check_line(x, y):\n                    return self.grid[y][x]\n        # Check for draw\n        if self.is_full():\n            return "Draw"\n        return None\n\n# In game.py\nclass Game:\n    # ... existing methods ...\n\n    def draw(self, screen):\n        self.board.draw_board(screen)\n        if self.winner:\n            font = pygame.font.Font(None, 74)\n            if self.winner == "Draw":\n                text = font.render("It\'s a draw!", True, (0, 0, 0))\n            else:\n                text = font.render(f"{self.winner} wins!", True, (0, 0, 0))\n            screen.blit(text, (150, 250))\n\n\nImplement these changes to ensure the game correctly handles all possible outcomes, including a draw.'} |

1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a standard Gomoku game..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code is mostly well-structured and follows the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the `check_winner` method in the `Board` class. The method currently checks for a winner by looking for five consecutive symbols in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions. However, it does not account for the possibility of over-counting when there are more than five consecutive symbols. For example, if there are six or more consecutive symbols, it should still only count as one win.

To fix this, you should modify the `check_direction` method to ensure it only counts exactly five consecutive symbols and not more. Here's how you can adjust the logic:

```python
def check_direction(self, x, y, dx, dy):
    # Check a single direction for exactly 5 in a row
    count = 0
    player = self.grid[y][x]
    for i in range(5):
        nx, ny = x + i * dx, y + i * dy
        if 0 <= nx < self.size and 0 <= ny < self.size and self.grid[ny][nx] == player:
            count += 1
        else:
            break
    # Ensure there are no more than 5 in a row
    if count == 5:
        # Check the next position in the same direction
        nx, ny = x + 5 * dx, y + 5 * dy
        if 0 <= nx < self.size and 0 <= ny < self.size and self.grid[ny][nx] == player:
            return False
        # Check the previous position in the opposite direction
        nx, ny = x - dx, y - dy
        if 0 <= nx < self.size and 0 <= ny < self.size and self.grid[ny][nx] == player:
            return False
        return True
    return False
```

This adjustment ensures that only exactly five consecutive symbols are counted as a win, preventing any over-counting issues.

Here's how you can adjust the logic:\n\npython\ndef check_direction(self, x, y, dx, dy):\n    # Check a single direction for exactly 5 in a row\n    count = 0\n    player = self.grid[y][x]\n    for i in range(5):\n        nx, ny = x + i * dx, y + i * dy\n        if 0 &lt;= nx &lt; self.size and 0 &lt;= ny &lt; self.size and self.grid[ny][nx] == player:\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            break\n    # Ensure there are no more than 5 in a row\n    if count == 5:\n        # Check the next position in the same direction\n        nx, ny = x + 5 * dx, y + 5 * dy\n        if 0 &lt;= nx &lt; self.size and 0 &lt;= ny &lt; self.size and self.grid[ny][nx] == player:\n            return False\n        # Check the previous position in the opposite direction\n        nx, ny = x - dx, y - dy\n        if 0 &lt;= nx &lt; self.size and 0 &lt;= ny &lt; self.size and self.grid[ny][nx] == player:\n            return False\n        return True\n    return False\n\n\nThis adjustment ensures that only exactly five consecutive symbols are counted as a win, preventing any over-counting issues."} |

Comments on Codes:
"The code is mostly well-structured and follows the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the `check_winner` method in the `Board` class. The method currently checks for a winner by looking for five consecutive symbols in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions. However, it does not account for the possibility of over-counting when there are more than five consecutive symbols. For example, if there are six or more consecutive symbols, it should still only count as one win.

To fix this, you should modify the `check_direction` method to ensure it only counts exactly five consecutive symbols and not more. Here's how you can adjust the logic:

```python
def check_direction(self, x, y, dx, dy):
    # Check a single direction for exactly 5 in a row
    count = 0
    player = self.grid[y][x]
    for i in range(5):
        nx, ny = x + i * dx, y + i * dy
        if 0 <= nx < self.size and 0 <= ny < self.size and self.grid[ny][nx] == player:
            count += 1
        else:
            break
    # Ensure there are no more than 5 in a row
    if count == 5:
        # Check the next position in the same direction
        nx, ny = x + 5 * dx, y + 5 * dy
        if 0 <= nx < self.size and 0 <= ny < self.size and self.grid[ny][nx] == player:
            return False
        # Check the previous position in the opposite direction
        nx, ny = x - dx, y - dy
        if 0 <= nx < self.size and 0 <= ny < self.size and self.grid[ny][nx] == player:
            return False
        return True
    return False
```

This adjustment ensures that only exactly five consecutive symbols are counted as a win, preventing any over-counting issues."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

However, there is a potential issue with the check_winner method in the Board class. The method currently checks for a winner by looking for five consecutive symbols in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions. However, it does not account for the possibility of over-counting when there are more than five consecutive symbols. For example, if there are six or more consecutive symbols, it should still only count as one win.\n\nTo fix this, you should modify the check_direction method to ensure it only counts exactly five consecutive symbols and not more. Here's how you can adjust the logic:\n\npython\ndef check_direction(self, x, y, dx, dy):\n    # Check a single direction for exactly 5 in a row\n    count = 0\n    player = self.grid[y][x]\n    for i in range(5):\n        nx, ny = x + i * dx, y + i * dy\n        if 0 &lt;= nx &lt; self.size and 0 &lt;= ny &lt; self.size and self.grid[ny][nx] == player:\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            break\n    # Ensure there are no more than 5 in a row\n    if count == 5:\n        # Check the next position in the same direction\n        nx, ny = x + 5 * dx, y + 5 * dy\n        if 0 &lt;= nx &lt; self.size and 0 &lt;= ny &lt; self.size and self.grid[ny][nx] == player:\n            return False\n        # Check the previous position in the opposite direction\n        nx, ny = x - dx, y - dy\n        if 0 &lt;= nx &lt; self.size and 0 &lt;= ny &lt; self.size and self.grid[ny][nx] == player:\n            return False\n        return True\n    return False\n\n\nThis adjustment ensures that only exactly five consecutive symbols are counted as a win, preventing any over-counting issues."} |

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a standard Gomoku game..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the `check_winner` method in the `Board` class. The method currently checks for a winner by looking for exactly 5 in a row, but it does not account for the possibility of having more than 5 in a row, which is not allowed in standard Gomoku rules. This could lead to incorrect winner detection if a player manages to place more than 5 stones in a row.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
Modify the `check_direction` method to ensure that it only returns `True` if there are exactly 5 stones in a row, with no additional stones in the same line beyond the 5. This involves checking the positions immediately before and after the 5 stones to ensure they are either out of bounds or occupied by the opposite player.

Here's how you can revise the `check_direction` method:

```python
def check_direction(self, x, y, dx, dy):
    # Check a single direction for exactly 5 in a row
    count = 0
    player = self.grid[y][x]
    for i in range(5):
        nx, ny = x + i * dx, y + i * dy
        if 0 <= nx < self.size and 0 <= ny < self.size and self.grid[ny][nx] == player:
            count += 1
        else:
            break
    # Ensure there are exactly 5 in a row and no more
    if count == 5:

        nx, ny = x + 5 * dx, y + 5 * dy
        if 0 <= nx < self.size and 0 <= ny < self.size and self.grid[ny][nx] == player:
            return False
        # Check the previous position in the opposite direction

            return False
        return True
    return False
```

This change ensures that the game correctly identifies a winner only when there are exactly 5 stones in a row, adhering to the standard Gomoku rules.

[2025-21-01 16:18:08 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the `check_winner` method in the `Board` class. The method currently checks for a winner by looking for exactly 5 in a row, but it does not account for the possibility of having more than 5 in a row, which is not allowed in standard Gomoku rules. This could lead to incorrect winner detection if a player manages to place more than 5 stones in a row.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
Modify the `check_direction` method to ensure that it only returns `True` if there are exactly 5 stones in a row, with no additional stones in the same line beyond the 5. This involves checking the positions immediately before and after the 5 stones to ensure they are either out of bounds or occupied by the opposite player.

Here's how you can revise the `check_direction` method:

```python
def check_direction(self, x, y, dx, dy):
    # Check a single direction for exactly 5 in a row
    count = 0
    player = self.grid[y][x]
    for i in range(5):
        nx, ny = x + i * dx, y + i * dy
        if 0 <= nx < self.size and 0 <= ny < self.size and self.grid[ny][nx] == player:
            count += 1
        else:
            break
    # Ensure there are exactly 5 in a row and no more
    if count == 5:
        # Check the next position in the same direction
        nx, ny = x + 5 * dx, y + 5 * dy
        if 0 <= nx < self.size and 0 <= ny < self.size and self.grid[ny][nx] == player:
            return False
        # Check the previous position in the opposite direction
        nx, ny = x - dx, y - dy
        if 0 <= nx < self.size and 0 <= ny < self.size and self.grid[ny][nx] == player:
            return False
        return True
    return False
```

This change ensures that the game correctly identifies a winner only when there are exactly 5 stones in a row, adhering to the standard Gomoku rules.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the `check_winner` method in the `Board` class. The method currently checks for a winner by looking for exactly 5 in a row, but it does not account for the possibility of having more than 5 in a row, which is not allowed in standard Gomoku rules. This could lead to incorrect winner detection if a player manages to place more than 5 stones in a row.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
Modify the `check_direction` method to ensure that it only returns `True` if there are exactly 5 stones in a row, with no additional stones in the same line beyond the 5. This involves checking the positions immediately before and after the 5 stones to ensure they are either out of bounds or occupied by the opposite player.

Here's how you can revise the `check_direction` method:

```python
def check_direction(self, x, y, dx, dy):
    # Check a single direction for exactly 5 in a row
    count = 0
    player = self.grid[y][x]
    for i in range(5):
        nx, ny = x + i * dx, y + i * dy
        if 0 <= nx < self.size and 0 <= ny < self.size and self.grid[ny][nx] == player:
            count += 1
        else:
            break
    # Ensure there are exactly 5 in a row and no more
    if count == 5:
        # Check the next position in the same direction
        nx, ny = x + 5 * dx, y + 5 * dy
        if 0 <= nx < self.size and 0 <= ny < self.size and self.grid[ny][nx] == player:
            return False
        # Check the previous position in the opposite direction
        nx, ny = x - dx, y - dy
        if 0 <= nx < self.size and 0 <= ny < self.size and self.grid[ny][nx] == player:
            return False
        return True
    return False
```

This change ensures that the game correctly identifies a winner only when there are exactly 5 stones in a row, adhering to the standard Gomoku rules."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, the primary external library used in this project is `pygame`. Here is the `requirements.txt` file specifying the necessary dependency:
```
pygame>=2.0.0
```
This ensures that the project will have the necessary version of `pygame` to run the Gomoku game application. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a standard Gomoku game..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

As the Chief Executive Officer, I can confirm that the Programmer has correctly identified the main dependency for the Gomoku game project. The `requirements.txt` file should indeed specify the `pygame` library, which is essential for running the game. Here is the finalized `requirements.txt` file for the project:

```
pygame>=2.0.0
```

This file ensures that anyone who wants to run the Gomoku game will have the necessary version of `pygame` installed. If there are any additional dependencies or updates in the future, this file can be updated accordingly to reflect those changes.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

# Gomoku Game

Welcome to the Gomoku Game! This application allows you to play the classic board game Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, against another player. The game is implemented using Python and Pygame, providing a simple and interactive graphical interface.

## Main Functions

- **Game Board**: A 15x15 grid where players take turns placing their symbols (X or O).
- **Two Players**: The game supports two players, each taking turns to place their symbol on the board.
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically detects when a player has won by placing five of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- **Draw Detection**: The game can also detect when the board is full and the game ends in a draw.
- **Reset Functionality**: Players can reset the game to start a new match.

## Quick Install

To run the Gomoku Game, you need to have Python and Pygame installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Pygame**: Use pip to install Pygame, which is required for the graphical interface.
   ```bash
   pip install pygame>=2.0.0
   ```

3. **Download the Game Files**: Ensure you have all the necessary Python files (`main.py`, `game.py`, `board.py`, `player.py`) in the same directory.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the `main.py` file to start the game.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Game Interface**: A window will open displaying the Gomoku board. The board consists of a 15x15 grid.

3. **Taking Turns**: Players take turns clicking on the grid to place their symbol (X for Player 1 and O for Player 2). The game automatically switches turns after each move.

4. **Winning the Game**: The first player to align five of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. A message will be displayed announcing the winner.

5. **Draw**: If the board is full and no player has aligned five symbols, the game ends in a draw.

6. **Resetting the Game**: Close and reopen the application to start a new game.

## Additional Information

- **Game Logic**: The game logic is handled in `game.py`, which manages player turns, move validation, and win/draw conditions.
- **Board Management**: The board state and rendering are managed in `board.py`.
- **Player Representation**: Players are represented by the `Player` class in `player.py`.

Enjoy playing Gomoku and challenge your friends to see who can master the board!
