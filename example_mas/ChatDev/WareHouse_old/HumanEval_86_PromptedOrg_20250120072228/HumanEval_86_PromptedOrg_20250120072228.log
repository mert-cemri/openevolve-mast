Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and fixing a piece of software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to implement the necessary code functionality directly in Python, which aligns with the user's request. What are your thoughts on this?

To solve the task, we need to implement the `anti_shuffle` function, which takes a string and returns an ordered version of it. The function should sort the characters of each word in ascending order based on their ASCII values while preserving the order of words and spaces.

Here's a breakdown of the core function needed:

1. **Function Name**: `anti_shuffle`
   - **Purpose**: To reorder the characters of each word in a string in ascending order based on ASCII values, while preserving the order of words and spaces.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python

'''

Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
ascending order based on ascii value.
Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

For example:
anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'
anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'
anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'

'''

def anti_shuffle(s):
    # Split the string into words and spaces
    words = s.split(' ')
    # Sort each word individually and join them back with spaces
    sorted_words = [''.join(sorted(word)) for word in words]
    # Join the sorted words with spaces to form the final string
    return ' '.join(sorted_words)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(anti_shuffle('Hi'))  # Output: 'Hi'
    print(anti_shuffle('hello'))  # Output: 'ehllo'
    print(anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!'))  # Output: 'Hello !!!Wdlor'

```

This code defines the `anti_shuffle` function, which processes each word in the input string by sorting its characters and then reconstructs the string with the sorted words, maintaining the original spacing. The example usage demonstrates how the function works with different inputs.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
