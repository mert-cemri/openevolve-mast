# Largest Divisor Finder

This software provides a simple function to find the largest divisor of a given integer `n` that is smaller than `n` itself. This can be useful in various mathematical computations and applications where understanding the divisors of a number is necessary.

## Main Functionality

The primary function of this software is:

- `largest_divisor(n: int) -> int`: This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest integer that divides `n` evenly and is smaller than `n`.

### Example

```python
>>> largest_divisor(15)
5
```

In this example, the largest divisor of 15 that is smaller than 15 is 5.

## Installation

To use this software, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**

   Change your directory to the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

   Replace `<repository-directory>` with the actual directory name.

3. **Run the Code**

   You can run the code directly using Python:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Import the Function**

   To use the `largest_divisor` function in your own scripts, you need to import it:

   ```python
   from main import largest_divisor
   ```

2. **Call the Function**

   Call the function with an integer argument to get the largest divisor:

   ```python
   result = largest_divisor(15)
   print(result)  # Output will be 5
   ```

## Documentation

For more detailed documentation, you can refer to the comments within the code. The function is straightforward and designed to be easy to integrate into larger projects.
