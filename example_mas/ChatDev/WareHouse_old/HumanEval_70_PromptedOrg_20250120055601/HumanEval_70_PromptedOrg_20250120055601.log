Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and fixing a piece of software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to focus on implementing the necessary functionality in Python without any additional presentation or visualization layers. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree. An "Application" is the most appropriate modality for this task, as it involves implementing and testing a specific function in Python. This aligns with the customer's request to focus solely on the code functionality. Let's proceed with this modality.

To solve the task, we need to implement the `strange_sort_list` function in Python. This function will take a list of integers and return a new list sorted in a "strange" order, where we alternate between the minimum and maximum of the remaining integers.

Here is the plan:

1. **Function Name**: `strange_sort_list`
   - **Purpose**: To sort a list of integers in a "strange" order, starting with the minimum, then the maximum of the remaining integers, then the next minimum, and so on.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python

'''

Given list of integers, return list in strange order.
Strange sorting, is when you start with the minimum value,
then maximum of the remaining integers, then minimum and so on.

Examples:
strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 4, 2, 3]
strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5, 5, 5, 5]
strange_sort_list([]) == []

'''

def strange_sort_list(lst):
    result = []
    lst.sort()
    while lst:
        result.append(lst.pop(0))  # Append the minimum
        if lst:
            result.append(lst.pop(-1))  # Append the maximum
    return result

```

This code implements the `strange_sort_list` function as described. It sorts the input list, then alternates between appending the smallest and largest remaining elements to the result list until all elements are processed.

    while lst:

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses built-in Python functions and data structures. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to provide a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can create an empty one:

```
# requirements.txt

```

This indicates that no additional packages are required beyond the standard Python library.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses built-in Python functions and data structures. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to provide a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can create an empty one:

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            
def strange_sort_list(lst):
    '''
    Given list of integers, return list in strange order.
    Strange sorting, is when you start with the minimum value,
    then maximum of the remaining integers, then minimum and so on.

    Examples:
    strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 4, 2, 3]
    strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5, 5, 5, 5]
    strange_sort_list([]) == []

To complete the task, you will provide strategic guidance and instructions to your team, ensuring that the solution meets the customer's needs and aligns with the company's objectives.]

# Strange Sort List

This software provides a function to sort a list of integers in a "strange" order. The strange sorting starts with the minimum value, then the maximum of the remaining integers, then the next minimum, and so on.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `strange_sort_list(lst)`. This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list sorted in the described strange order.

### Examples

- `strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4])` returns `[1, 4, 2, 3]`
- `strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5])` returns `[5, 5, 5, 5]`
- `strange_sort_list([])` returns `[]`

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, so there is no need to install additional packages. You can directly use the function in your Python environment.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change your directory to the cloned repository.

   ```bash
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Run the Function**: You can use the `strange_sort_list` function in your Python scripts. Here is an example of how to use it:

   ```python
   from main import strange_sort_list

   # Example usage
   sorted_list = strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4])
   print(sorted_list)  # Output: [1, 4, 2, 3]
   ```

## Documentation

For more detailed documentation, please refer to the comments within the `main.py` file. The function is straightforward and does not require additional configuration or setup.

## Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please feel free to reach out through the repository's issue tracker. We are here to help you with any problems or inquiries you might have regarding the software.
