Given the task at hand, which involves writing a piece of software code, I believe the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a functional piece of code, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts?

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To complete the task, we need to implement the `rolling_max` function in Python as specified by the customer. The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus solely on the logic for generating the rolling maximum list from a given list of integers.

Let's outline the necessary function:

1. **Function: `rolling_max`**
   - **Purpose**: To generate a list of rolling maximum elements found until the given moment in the sequence.
   - **Input**: A list of integers.
   - **Output**: A list of integers representing the rolling maximum.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python
'''

This module contains the implementation of the rolling_max function which generates a list of rolling maximum elements from a given list of integers.

'''

from typing import List

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment
    in the sequence.
    >>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    """
    if not numbers:
        return []
    
    max_so_far = numbers[0]
    result = [max_so_far]
    
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        if num > max_so_far:
            max_so_far = num
        result.append(max_so_far)
    
    return result
```

This code defines the `rolling_max` function, which iterates through the list of numbers, keeps track of the maximum value encountered so far, and appends it to the result list. The function handles the edge case of an empty list by returning an empty list.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.

"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, the `rolling_max` function does not require any external libraries or packages beyond the standard Python library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no additional dependencies needed.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```
If you plan to add more functionality in the future that requires external libraries, you can update this file accordingly. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project should indeed be empty. This ensures that anyone using the code understands that no additional packages are needed for it to function correctly.

# Rolling Max Application

This application provides a simple utility function to compute the rolling maximum of a list of integers. The rolling maximum is the highest value encountered in the list up to each point in the sequence.

## Main Functionality

The primary function of this application is:

- `rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]`: This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list where each element is the maximum value encountered in the input list up to that point.

### Example

```python
from main import rolling_max

result = rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
```

## Installation

This application does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. You can run the application in any standard Python environment.

### Quick Install

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file to your local machine.

3. No additional installation steps are required since there are no external dependencies.

## How to Use

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

3. Run a Python interpreter or script that imports and uses the `rolling_max` function.

### Example Usage

```bash
python
```

```python
from main import rolling_max

# Test the function with a sample list
print(rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]))
```

This will output:

```
[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
```

## Documentation

The `rolling_max` function is straightforward and does not require additional configuration. It is designed to be used in any Python environment without the need for external libraries.
