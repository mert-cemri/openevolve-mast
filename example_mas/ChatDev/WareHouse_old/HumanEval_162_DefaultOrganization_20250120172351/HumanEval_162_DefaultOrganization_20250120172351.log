Given the task is to write a function that converts a string to its MD5 hash, the most appropriate product modality would be an "Application" since it involves implementing a software tool using Python. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree. The task involves writing a Python function, which aligns well with the "Application" modality as it involves implementing a software tool.

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To complete the task, we need to implement the `string_to_md5` function in Python. The function should take a string as input and return its MD5 hash equivalent. If the input string is empty, the function should return `None`. We will not implement a GUI as per the customer's specific instruction to only write the necessary code in `main.py`.

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Definition**: Define the function `string_to_md5` that takes a single argument `text`.
2. **Check for Empty String**: If `text` is an empty string, return `None`.
3. **Compute MD5 Hash**: Use Python's `hashlib` library to compute the MD5 hash of the input string.
4. **Return Hash**: Return the computed MD5 hash as a hexadecimal string.

Now, let's write the code in `main.py`.

MAIN.PY

```python
'''
This module contains a function to convert a given string to its MD5 hash equivalent.
'''

import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text):
    """
    Given a string 'text', return its md5 hash equivalent string.
    If 'text' is an empty string, return None.

    >>> string_to_md5('Hello world') == '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'
    """
    if text == "":
        return None
    
    # Create an md5 hash object
    md5_hash = hashlib.md5()
    
    # Update the hash object with the bytes of the text
    md5_hash.update(text.encode('utf-8'))
    
    # Return the hexadecimal digest of the hash
    return md5_hash.hexdigest()
```

This code defines the `string_to_md5` function as required. It checks if the input string is empty and returns `None` in that case. Otherwise, it computes the MD5 hash using the `hashlib` library and returns the hash as a hexadecimal string.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer correctly identified, the `hashlib` library used in the code is a built-in Python library and does not require installation via a package manager like `pip`. Therefore, there are no external dependencies for this project. The `requirements.txt` file will be empty, indicating that no additional packages need to be installed for the code to run properly.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

# String to MD5 Converter

This software module provides a simple utility to convert a given string into its MD5 hash equivalent. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, requiring no external dependencies beyond Python's standard library.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this software is encapsulated in the `string_to_md5` function. This function takes a string as input and returns its MD5 hash equivalent. If the input string is empty, the function returns `None`.

### Function Definition

```python
def string_to_md5(text):
    """
    Given a string 'text', return its md5 hash equivalent string.
    If 'text' is an empty string, return None.

    >>> string_to_md5('Hello world') == '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'
    """
```

### How It Works

1. **Input Check**: The function first checks if the input string is empty. If it is, the function returns `None`.
2. **MD5 Hashing**: If the input string is not empty, the function creates an MD5 hash object using Python's `hashlib` library.
3. **Encoding**: The input string is encoded to bytes using UTF-8 encoding.
4. **Hash Calculation**: The encoded bytes are fed into the MD5 hash object.
5. **Output**: The function returns the hexadecimal representation of the MD5 hash.

## Installation

This module does not require any external dependencies. It uses Python's built-in `hashlib` library, which is included in the standard Python distribution.

### Quick Install

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

To use the `string_to_md5` function, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Function**: Ensure the `string_to_md5` function is accessible in your Python environment. This can be done by placing the `main.py` file in your project directory and importing the function.

    ```python
    from main import string_to_md5
    ```

2. **Call the Function**: Pass the string you want to convert to its MD5 hash as an argument to the `string_to_md5` function.

    ```python
    result = string_to_md5('Hello world')
    print(result)  # Output: '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'
    ```

3. **Handle Empty Strings**: If you pass an empty string, the function will return `None`.

    ```python
    result = string_to_md5('')
    print(result)  # Output: None
    ```

## Documentation

This module is straightforward and does not require extensive documentation. The function is self-contained and performs a single task efficiently. For any additional questions or support, please refer to Python's [hashlib documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html) for more information on MD5 hashing.

By following the above instructions, you can easily integrate and use the `string_to_md5` function in your Python projects.
