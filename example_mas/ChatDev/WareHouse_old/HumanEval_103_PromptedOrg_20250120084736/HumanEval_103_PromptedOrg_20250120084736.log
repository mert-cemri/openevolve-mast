To complete the task, we need to implement the `rounded_avg` function in Python. This function will calculate the average of integers from `n` to `m`, round it to the nearest integer, and convert the result to a binary string. If `n` is greater than `m`, the function will return `-1`.

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Name**: `rounded_avg`
   - **Purpose**: Compute the average of integers from `n` to `m`, round it, and convert to binary. Return `-1` if `n > m`.

2. **Steps to Implement**:
   - Check if `n` is greater than `m`. If true, return `-1`.
   - Calculate the sum of integers from `n` to `m`.
   - Count the number of integers from `n` to `m`.
   - Compute the average by dividing the sum by the count.
   - Round the average to the nearest integer.
   - Convert the rounded average to a binary string using Python's `bin()` function.
   - Return the binary string.

Now, let's write the code in the `main.py` file.

```python

This module contains the implementation of the rounded_avg function, which calculates the average of integers from n to m, rounds it to the nearest integer, and converts it to a binary string. If n is greater than m, it returns -1.

    Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.
    If n is greater than m, return -1.
    Example:
    rounded_avg(1, 5) => "0b11"
    rounded_avg(7, 5) => -1
    rounded_avg(10, 20) => "0b1111"
    rounded_avg(20, 33) => "0b11010"
    """
    if n > m:
        return -1
    
    total_sum = sum(range(n, m + 1))
    count = m - n + 1
    average = total_sum / count
    rounded_average = round(average)
    return bin(rounded_average)

```

This code should fulfill the requirements specified by the customer. It checks if `n` is greater than `m`, calculates the average of the range, rounds it, and converts it to a binary string.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code uses only built-in Python functions and libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, indicating that no additional packages need to be installed for this project.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Rounded Average Calculator

This software provides a simple function to calculate the rounded average of integers between two given numbers, inclusive, and returns the result as a binary string. It is designed to be used in Python applications where such functionality is required.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this software is encapsulated in the `rounded_avg` function. This function performs the following tasks:

- Accepts two positive integers, `n` and `m`.
- Computes the average of all integers from `n` to `m`, inclusive.
- Rounds the average to the nearest integer.
- Converts the rounded integer to a binary string.
- Returns `-1` if `n` is greater than `m`.

### Example Usage

```python
result = rounded_avg(1, 5)
print(result)  # Output: "0b11"

result = rounded_avg(7, 5)
print(result)  # Output: -1

result = rounded_avg(10, 20)
print(result)  # Output: "0b1111"

result = rounded_avg(20, 33)
print(result)  # Output: "0b11010"
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies beyond the standard Python library. To use the `rounded_avg` function, simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Installing Python

If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the instructions for your operating system to complete the installation.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**
   - You can clone the repository using Git or download the ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.

3. **Run the Code:**
   - You can run the code by executing the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt. Use the Python interpreter to execute the file.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Use the Function:**
   - You can import the `rounded_avg` function into your own Python scripts and use it as needed.

```python
from main import rounded_avg

result = rounded_avg(1, 5)
print(result)  # Output: "0b11"
```

## Documentation

For further details on how the function works, refer to the docstring provided within the `main.py` file. This includes information on the parameters, return values, and example usage.

## Support

For any issues or questions regarding the use of this software, please contact our support team at support@chatdev.com.
