We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To solve the task, we need to implement the `select_words` function in Python. This function will take a string `s` and a natural number `n` as inputs and return a list of words from the string that contain exactly `n` consonants. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Split the String**: We will split the input string `s` into individual words.
2. **Identify Consonants**: We will define a set of consonants to check against each character in the words.
3. **Count Consonants**: For each word, we will count the number of consonants.
4. **Filter Words**: We will collect words that have exactly `n` consonants.
5. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the list of words that meet the criteria.

Now, let's implement this in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains the implementation of the select_words function, which
returns a list of words from a given string that contain exactly a specified
number of consonants.

def select_words(s, n):
    """Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement

    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
    Examples:
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
    select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []
    select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
    select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]
    """
    # Define the set of consonants
    consonants = set("bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ")
    
    # Split the string into words
    words = s.split()
    
    # Initialize the result list
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each word
    for word in words:
        # Count the number of consonants in the word
        consonant_count = sum(1 for char in word if char in consonants)
        
        # If the count matches n, add the word to the result list
        if consonant_count == n:
            result.append(word)
    
    # Return the result list
    return result
```

This implementation should now correctly solve the task as described, returning a list of words with exactly `n` consonants from the input string `s`.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            
def select_words(s, n):
    """Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement 
    a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly 
    n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
    Examples:
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
    select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []
    select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
    select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]

.
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required, as it only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for the sake of completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any external libraries beyond the standard Python library.

# Select Words by Consonant Count

## Introduction

The `select_words` function is a Python utility designed to extract words from a given string that contain exactly a specified number of consonants. This tool is particularly useful for text analysis tasks where consonant patterns are of interest.

## Main Functionality

- **Function Name:** `select_words`
- **Purpose:** Returns a list of words from a given string that contain exactly a specified number of consonants.
- **Input:**
  - `s`: A string containing words separated by spaces. The string is assumed to contain only letters and spaces.
  - `n`: A natural number representing the exact number of consonants a word must have to be included in the result.
- **Output:** A list of words from the input string `s` that contain exactly `n` consonants, in the order they appear in the string.

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## How to Use

1. **Set Up Your Environment:**

   Ensure you have Python installed. You can verify your installation by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

   If Python is installed, this command will return the version number.

2. **Using the Function:**

   - Save the provided code into a file named `main.py`.
   - You can then use the function by importing it into your Python script or by directly calling it in the Python interactive shell.

   Example usage:

   ```python
   from main import select_words

   result = select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4)
   print(result)  # Output: ["little"]

   result = select_words("Hello world", 4)
   print(result)  # Output: ["world"]
   ```

3. **Running the Function:**

   You can run the function in a Python environment by executing the script or by using an interactive Python shell.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Ensure that you modify the script to include test cases or interactive input as needed.

## Additional Notes

- The function assumes that the input string contains only letters and spaces. It does not handle punctuation or special characters.
- The function is case-insensitive with respect to consonants, meaning it treats uppercase and lowercase consonants equally.

This utility is simple yet effective for tasks involving text processing where consonant patterns are of interest. Feel free to integrate it into larger projects or use it as a standalone tool for specific text analysis tasks.
