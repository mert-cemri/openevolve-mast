We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python *. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

To solve the task, we need to implement the function `largest_prime_factor` in Python. The task does not require a GUI, despite the mention of it in the instructions. We will focus solely on implementing the function to find the largest prime factor of a given number `n`.

### Core Function

- **Function Name**: `largest_prime_factor`
  - **Purpose**: To calculate and return the largest prime factor of a given integer `n`.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

```python
'''

This module contains a function to find the largest prime factor of a given number.

def largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int:
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime.
    
    >>> largest_prime_factor(13195)
    29
    >>> largest_prime_factor(2048)
    2
    """
    # Start with the smallest prime factor
    factor = 2
    
    # Divide n by 2 until it is odd
    while n % factor == 0:
        n //= factor
    
    # Check for odd factors from 3 onwards
    factor = 3
    while factor * factor <= n:
        while n % factor == 0:
            n //= factor
        factor += 2
    
    # If n becomes a prime number greater than 2
    if n > 2:
        return n
    else:
        return factor - 2

```

This code defines the function `largest_prime_factor` which calculates the largest prime factor of a given integer `n`. It starts by dividing `n` by 2 until it is odd, then checks for odd factors starting from 3. If `n` becomes a prime number greater than 2, it returns `n`; otherwise, it returns the last factor checked. This implementation efficiently finds the largest prime factor by reducing `n` as much as possible with each factor.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `largest_prime_factor` only uses basic Python operations and does not rely on any additional libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed for the project to run properly.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

# Largest Prime Factor Finder

This software module provides a function to find the largest prime factor of a given number. It is designed to be simple and efficient, focusing solely on the task of identifying the largest prime factor of a number greater than 1, which is not a prime itself.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this module is:

- `largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int`: This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest prime factor of `n`. It assumes that `n` is greater than 1 and is not a prime number itself.

### Example Usage

```python
>>> largest_prime_factor(13195)
29
>>> largest_prime_factor(2048)
2
```

## Installation

This module does not have any external dependencies, so you can use it directly in your Python environment. However, if you are setting up a new environment, you might want to ensure you have Python installed.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or download the module**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the `largest_prime_factor` function.

3. **Run the function**: You can execute the function directly in a Python script or an interactive Python session.

## How to Use

1. **Open a Python environment**: You can use an IDE like PyCharm, VSCode, or simply run Python in your terminal.

2. **Import the function**: If you have saved the `main.py` file in your project, you can import the function using:

   ```python
   from main import largest_prime_factor
   ```

3. **Call the function**: Pass an integer greater than 1 (which is not a prime) to the function to get its largest prime factor.

   ```python
   result = largest_prime_factor(13195)
   print(result)  # Output will be 29
   ```

## Documentation

For further information on how the function works internally, you can refer to the docstring provided within the `main.py` file. The function uses a straightforward algorithm to determine the largest prime factor by iteratively dividing the number by its smallest factors.

Feel free to modify or extend the functionality as needed for your specific use case. This module is designed to be a simple, standalone solution for finding the largest prime factor of a number.

This module does not have any external dependencies, so you can use it directly in your Python environment. However, if you are setting up a new environment, you might want to ensure you have Python installed.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or download the module**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the `largest_prime_factor` function.

3. **Run the function**: You can execute the function directly in a Python script or an interactive Python session.

## How to Use

1. **Open a Python environment**: You can use an IDE like PyCharm, VSCode, or simply run Python in your terminal.

2. **Import the function**: If you have saved the `main.py` file in your project, you can import the function using:

   ```python
   from main import largest_prime_factor
   ```

3. **Call the function**: Pass an integer greater than 1 (which is not a prime) to the function to get its largest prime factor.

   ```python
   result = largest_prime_factor(13195)
   print(result)  # Output will be 29
   ```

## Documentation

For further information on how the function works internally, you can refer to the docstring provided within the `main.py` file. The function uses a straightforward algorithm to determine the largest prime factor by iteratively dividing the number by its smallest factors.

Feel free to modify or extend the functionality as needed for your specific use case. This module is designed to be a simple, standalone solution for finding the largest prime factor of a number.
