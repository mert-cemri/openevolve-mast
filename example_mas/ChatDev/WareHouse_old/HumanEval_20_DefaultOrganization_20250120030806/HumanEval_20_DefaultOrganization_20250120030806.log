To solve the task, we need to implement the function `find_closest_elements` that finds and returns the two closest numbers from a list. The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus solely on the logic of finding the closest elements.

### Core Function

- **find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]**: This function will iterate through the list of numbers, calculate the difference between each pair of numbers, and keep track of the pair with the smallest difference. It will return the pair in ascending order.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
# main.py

'''
This module contains a function to find the two closest numbers in a list.

from typing import List, Tuple

    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
    (2.0, 2.2)
    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
    (2.0, 2.0)
    """
    # Sort the numbers to simplify finding the closest pair
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Initialize variables to store the minimum difference and the closest pair
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (numbers[0], numbers[1])
    
    # Iterate through the sorted list to find the closest pair
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        diff = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i], numbers[i + 1])
    
    return closest_pair
```

This code sorts the list of numbers and then iterates through the sorted list to find the pair of numbers with the smallest difference. It returns the pair in ascending order, as required. The function is efficient and works correctly for the given examples.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the given Python code, there are no external libraries or packages being used that need to be specified in a `requirements.txt` file. The code only uses built-in Python functionalities, such as sorting and basic list operations, which do not require any additional dependencies.

Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as follows:

```
```

If you plan to add any additional features or use external libraries in the future, you would then list those dependencies in this file.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given Python code, there are no external libraries or packages being used that need to be specified in a `requirements.txt` file. The code only uses built-in Python functionalities, such as sorting and basic list operations, which do not require any additional dependencies.
Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as follows:
```
```
If you plan to add any additional features or use external libraries in the future, you would then list those dependencies in this file. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I concur with the Programmer's assessment. The current implementation of the `find_closest_elements` function does not utilize any external libraries or packages, meaning there are no dependencies that need to be specified in a `requirements.txt` file. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should remain empty at this stage.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
```

If in the future, additional features are added that require external libraries, those dependencies should be listed in this file to ensure proper project setup and functionality.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha
