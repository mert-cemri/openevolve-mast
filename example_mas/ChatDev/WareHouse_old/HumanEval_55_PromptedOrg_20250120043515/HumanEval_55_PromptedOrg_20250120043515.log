.
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To solve the task, we need to implement the `fib` function that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

The function `fib(n)` should return the n-th Fibonacci number, where `fib(1)` returns 1, `fib(2)` returns 1, `fib(3)` returns 2, and so on.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Name**: `fib`
   - **Purpose**: Calculate the n-th Fibonacci number.
   - **Parameters**: `n` (int) - the position in the Fibonacci sequence.
   - **Returns**: The n-th Fibonacci number.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number.

'''

def fib(n: int) -> int:
    """Return n-th Fibonacci number.
    >>> fib(10)
    55
    >>> fib(1)
    1
    >>> fib(8)
    21
    """
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 1, 1
        for _ in range(3, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b
```

This code defines the `fib` function, which calculates the n-th Fibonacci number using an iterative approach. The function checks if `n` is less than or equal to 0 and raises a `ValueError` if so, as Fibonacci numbers are defined for positive integers only. For `n` equal to 1 or 2, it returns 1 directly. For other values, it uses a loop to compute the Fibonacci number iteratively.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

# Fibonacci Calculator

This software module provides a function to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. This module allows you to compute the n-th Fibonacci number efficiently.

## Main Function

The main function provided by this module is `fib(n: int) -> int`. This function returns the n-th Fibonacci number, where `n` is a positive integer.

### Function Signature

```python
def fib(n: int) -> int:
    """Return n-th Fibonacci number."""
```

### Example Usage

```python
>>> fib(10)
55
>>> fib(1)
1
>>> fib(8)
21
```

### Function Behavior

- If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function raises a `ValueError` indicating that `n` must be a positive integer.
- If `n` is 1 or 2, the function returns 1, as the first two Fibonacci numbers are both 1.
- For `n` greater than 2, the function calculates the Fibonacci number using an iterative approach for efficiency.

## Installation

To use this module, you need to have Python installed on your system. This module does not require any external dependencies, so you can directly use it in your Python environment.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or Download the Module**: You can clone the repository or download the `main.py` file containing the Fibonacci function.

3. **Run the Function**: You can run the function in a Python environment or script by importing the `fib` function from `main.py`.

## How to Use

1. **Import the Function**: In your Python script or interactive shell, import the `fib` function.

    ```python
    from main import fib
    ```

2. **Call the Function**: Use the `fib` function by passing a positive integer to get the corresponding Fibonacci number.

    ```python
    result = fib(10)
    print(result)  # Output will be 55
    ```

3. **Error Handling**: Ensure that the input `n` is a positive integer to avoid `ValueError`.

## Documentation

This module is straightforward and does not require additional documentation beyond the function's docstring and this manual. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please contact our support team.
