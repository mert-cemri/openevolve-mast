To solve the task, we need to implement the `parse_music` function in Python. This function will take a string representing musical notes in a special ASCII format and return a list of integers corresponding to how many beats each note lasts. The function will parse the input string based on the provided legend:

- 'o' represents a whole note, lasting four beats.
- 'o|' represents a half note, lasting two beats.
- '.|' represents a quarter note, lasting one beat.

Here's how we can implement this in a single Python file named `main.py`.

main.py

```python

'''

This module contains the implementation of the parse_music function, which parses a string of musical notes
in a special ASCII format and returns a list of integers representing the duration of each note in beats.

    """
    # Split the input string by spaces to get individual note representations
    notes = music_string.split()
    
    # Create a mapping from note representation to beats
    note_to_beats = {
        'o': 4,
        'o|': 2,
        '.|': 1
    }
    
    # Parse each note and convert it to its corresponding beat count
    beats = [note_to_beats[note] for note in notes]
    
    return beats

```

This code defines the `parse_music` function, which splits the input string into individual notes, maps each note to its corresponding beat count using a dictionary, and returns the list of beat counts. This implementation directly follows the task requirements and ensures the function works as desired.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Since the provided code does not use any external libraries or packages, there are no specific dependencies required for the project to run. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty.

The Programmer is correct. The provided code for the `parse_music` function does not utilize any external libraries or packages beyond Python's standard library. Therefore, there are no specific dependencies required for the project to run. As a result, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Parse Music User Manual

Welcome to the Parse Music software! This tool is designed to parse a string of musical notes in a special ASCII format and return a list of integers representing the duration of each note in beats. This manual will guide you through the installation process, introduce the main function of the software, and provide instructions on how to use it.

## Main Function

The core function of this software is `parse_music`, which takes a string input representing musical notes and outputs a list of integers corresponding to the duration of each note in beats. The function recognizes the following note representations:

- `'o'` - Whole note, lasts four beats
- `'o|'` - Half note, lasts two beats
- `'.|'` - Quarter note, lasts one beat

### Example Usage

```python
from main import parse_music

music_string = 'o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o'
beats = parse_music(music_string)
print(beats)  # Output: [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]
```

## Installation

To use the Parse Music software, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the `main.py` file to your local machine.

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows:
       ```bash
       .\venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On macOS and Linux:
       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```

4. **Install Dependencies**: There are no additional dependencies required for this software, as it uses only the standard Python library.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Input**: Create a string representing musical notes using the specified ASCII format.

2. **Call the Function**: Use the `parse_music` function from the `main.py` file, passing your input string as an argument.

3. **Get the Output**: The function will return a list of integers, each representing the duration in beats of the corresponding note in the input string.

## Conclusion

The Parse Music software is a simple yet effective tool for converting musical note representations into beat durations. By following this manual, you should be able to set up your environment and use the software efficiently. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to reach out to our support team.
