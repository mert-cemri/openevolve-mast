Given the task at hand, which involves writing a piece of code to sort numbers represented as words, the most appropriate product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a software tool that processes input and provides output, aligning with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" is indeed the most suitable product modality for this task, as it involves writing and executing a piece of code to perform a specific function. Let's proceed with this modality.

To solve the task, we need to implement the `sort_numbers` function in Python. The function should take a space-delimited string of numerals (from 'zero' to 'nine') and return a string with the numbers sorted from smallest to largest. The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus solely on implementing the function in a single file.

Here is the plan:

1. **Function `sort_numbers`:** This function will:
   - Map each numeral word to its corresponding integer value.
   - Sort the list of integer values.
   - Map the sorted integers back to their numeral words.
   - Return the sorted numeral words as a space-delimited string.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains the function `sort_numbers` which sorts a space-delimited string of numeral words from 'zero' to 'nine'.

def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:

    Return the string with numbers sorted from smallest to largest
    >>> sort_numbers('three one five')
    'one three five'
    """
    # Mapping of numeral words to their corresponding integer values
    numeral_to_int = {
        'zero': 0,
        'one': 1,
        'two': 2,
        'three': 3,
        'four': 4,
        'five': 5,
        'six': 6,
        'seven': 7,
        'eight': 8,
        'nine': 9
    }
    
    # Mapping of integer values back to numeral words
    int_to_numeral = {v: k for k, v in numeral_to_int.items()}
    
    # Split the input string into a list of numeral words
    numeral_words = numbers.split()
    
    # Convert numeral words to integers
    int_values = [numeral_to_int[word] for word in numeral_words]
    
    # Sort the integer values
    sorted_int_values = sorted(int_values)
    
    # Convert sorted integers back to numeral words
    sorted_numeral_words = [int_to_numeral[value] for value in sorted_int_values]
    
    # Join the sorted numeral words into a space-delimited string
    return ' '.join(sorted_numeral_words)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(sort_numbers('three one five'))  # Output: 'one three five'
```

This code defines the `sort_numbers` function, which correctly sorts the input numeral words and returns them in the desired order. The example usage demonstrates how the function works.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
