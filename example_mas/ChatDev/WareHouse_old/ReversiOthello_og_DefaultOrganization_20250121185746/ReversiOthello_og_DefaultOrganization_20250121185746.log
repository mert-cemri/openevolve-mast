Considering the nature of the task, which is to develop a Reversi (Othello) board game, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because an application can effectively implement a visualized game, allowing users to interact with the game interface, make moves, and see the results in real-time. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Develop a Reversi (Othello) board game. Two players alternate placing discs on an 8x8 grid, flipping the opponent’s discs that lie between the newly placed piece and existing pieces of the same color. The game ends when the board is full or no valid moves remain.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a Reversi (Othello) board game. Two players alternate placing discs on an 8x8 grid, flipping the opponent’s discs that lie between the newly placed piece and existing pieces of the same color. The game ends when the board is full or no valid moves remain..

To develop the Reversi (Othello) board game in Python with a graphical user interface (GUI), we will use the Pygame library. Pygame is well-suited for creating games with graphical interfaces.

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **Game**: This class will manage the overall game state, including the board, current player, and game logic.
   - `__init__()`: Initialize the game state.
   - `reset_game()`: Reset the game to the initial state.
   - `make_move(x, y)`: Handle a player's move at position (x, y).
   - `is_valid_move(x, y)`: Check if a move is valid.
   - `flip_discs(x, y)`: Flip the opponent's discs according to the rules.
   - `get_valid_moves()`: Get a list of all valid moves for the current player.
   - `check_game_over()`: Determine if the game is over.

2. **Board**: This class will represent the game board.
   - `__init__()`: Initialize the board with the starting position.
   - `draw_board(screen)`: Draw the board and discs on the screen.
   - `update_board(x, y, player)`: Update the board with the player's move.

3. **Player**: This class will represent a player.
   - `__init__(color)`: Initialize the player with a color (black or white).

4. **Main**: This will be the entry point of the application, handling the game loop and user interactions.

### File Structure

1. `main.py`: The main file to run the game.
2. `game.py`: Contains the Game class.
3. `board.py`: Contains the Board class.
4. `player.py`: Contains the Player class.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a Reversi (Othello) board game. Two players alternate placing discs on an 8x8 grid, flipping the opponent’s discs that lie between the newly placed piece and existing pieces of the same color. The game ends when the board is full or no valid moves remain..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code implementation is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the `flip_discs` method in the `Board` class. The method assumes that the direction check has already been validated, but it doesn't handle the scenario where the board boundaries might be exceeded during the flipping process. This could lead to an IndexError if not properly handled.

**Comment with the Highest Priority:**
Ensure that the `flip_discs` method in the `Board` class checks for board boundaries while flipping discs to prevent potential IndexError.

**Suggestions on Revision:**
1. Modify the `flip_discs` method to include boundary checks within the while loop to ensure that `nx` and `ny` remain within the valid range of the board.

Here's the revised `flip_discs` method:

```python
def flip_discs(self, x, y, color):
    for dx, dy in [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]:
        if self.check_direction(x, y, dx, dy, color):
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            while 0 <= nx < 8 and 0 <= ny < 8 and self.grid[ny][nx] != color:
                self.grid[ny][nx] = color
                nx += dx
                ny += dy
```

This change ensures that the flipping process does not exceed the board's boundaries, preventing potential runtime errors.

Comments on Codes:
"The code implementation is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the `flip_discs` method in the `Board` class. The method assumes that the direction check has already been validated, but it doesn't handle the scenario where the board boundaries might be exceeded during the flipping process. This could lead to an IndexError if not properly handled.

**Comment with the Highest Priority:**
Ensure that the `flip_discs` method in the `Board` class checks for board boundaries while flipping discs to prevent potential IndexError.

**Suggestions on Revision:**
1. Modify the `flip_discs` method to include boundary checks within the while loop to ensure that `nx` and `ny` remain within the valid range of the board.

Here's the revised `flip_discs` method:

```python
def flip_discs(self, x, y, color):
    for dx, dy in [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]:
        if self.check_direction(x, y, dx, dy, color):
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            while 0 <= nx < 8 and 0 <= ny < 8 and self.grid[ny][nx] != color:
                self.grid[ny][nx] = color
                nx += dx
                ny += dy
```

This change ensures that the flipping process does not exceed the board's boundaries, preventing potential runtime errors."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a Reversi (Othello) board game. Two players alternate placing discs on an 8x8 grid, flipping the opponent’s discs that lie between the newly placed piece and existing pieces of the same color. The game ends when the board is full or no valid moves remain..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

This could lead to an IndexError if not properly handled.\n\nComment with the Highest Priority:\nEnsure that the flip_discs method in the Board class checks for board boundaries while flipping discs to prevent potential IndexError.\n\nSuggestions on Revision:\n1. Modify the flip_discs method to include boundary checks within the while loop to ensure that nx and ny remain within the valid range of the board.\n\nHere's the revised flip_discs method:\n\npython\ndef flip_discs(self, x, y, color):\n    for dx, dy in [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]:\n        if self.check_direction(x, y, dx, dy, color):\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            while 0 &lt;= nx &lt; 8 and 0 &lt;= ny &lt; 8 and self.grid[ny][nx] != color:\n                self.grid[ny][nx] = color\n                nx += dx\n                ny += dy\n\n\nThis change ensures that the flipping process does not exceed the board's boundaries, preventing potential runtime errors."} |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a Reversi (Othello) board game. Two players alternate placing discs on an 8x8 grid, flipping the opponent’s discs that lie between the newly placed piece and existing pieces of the same color. The game ends when the board is full or no valid moves remain..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the task requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the `handle_click` method in the `Game` class. The method currently does not handle the scenario where a player has no valid moves and the game should switch to the other player. This could lead to an infinite loop if both players have no valid moves, as the game does not end properly in this case.

**Comment with the highest priority:**
The `handle_click` method should be updated to ensure that the game ends when neither player has valid moves. Currently, it only switches players if the current player has no valid moves, but it does not check if the other player also has no valid moves, which should end the game.

**Suggested Revision:**
Modify the `handle_click` method in the `Game` class to check if both players have no valid moves and set `self.game_over` to `True` in that case.

```python
def handle_click(self, x, y):
    if self.game_over:
        return
    grid_x, grid_y = x // 100, y // 100
    if self.board.is_valid_move(grid_x, grid_y, self.current_player()):
        self.board.update_board(grid_x, grid_y, self.current_player())
        self.switch_player()
        if not self.board.get_valid_moves(self.current_player()):
            self.switch_player()
            if not self.board.get_valid_moves(self.current_player()):
                self.game_over = True
```

This change ensures that the game ends correctly when neither player can make a move, thus preventing any potential infinite loops and ensuring the game logic aligns with the rules of Reversi.

The method currently does not handle the scenario where a player has no valid moves and the game should switch to the other player.

Currently, it only switches players if the current player has no valid moves, but it does not check if the other player also has no valid moves, which should end the game.\n\nSuggested Revision:\nModify the handle_click method in the Game class to check if both players have no valid moves and set self.game_over to True in that case.\n\npython\ndef handle_click(self, x, y):\n    if self.game_over:\n        return\n    grid_x, grid_y = x // 100, y // 100\n    if self.board.is_valid_move(grid_x, grid_y, self.current_player()):\n        self.board.update_board(grid_x, grid_y, self.current_player())\n        self.switch_player()\n        if not self.board.get_valid_moves(self.current_player()):\n            self.switch_player()\n            if not self.board.get_valid_moves(self.current_player()):\n                self.game_over = True\n\n\nThis change ensures that the game ends correctly when neither player can make a move, thus preventing any potential infinite loops and ensuring the game logic aligns with the rules of Reversi.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the task requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the `handle_click` method in the `Game` class. The method currently does not handle the scenario where a player has no valid moves and the game should switch to the other player. This could lead to an infinite loop if both players have no valid moves, as the game does not end properly in this case.

**Comment with the highest priority:**
The `handle_click` method should be updated to ensure that the game ends when neither player has valid moves. Currently, it only switches players if the current player has no valid moves, but it does not check if the other player also has no valid moves, which should end the game.

**Suggested Revision:**
Modify the `handle_click` method in the `Game` class to check if both players have no valid moves and set `self.game_over` to `True` in that case.

```python
def handle_click(self, x, y):
    if self.game_over:
        return
    grid_x, grid_y = x // 100, y // 100
    if self.board.is_valid_move(grid_x, grid_y, self.current_player()):
        self.board.update_board(grid_x, grid_y, self.current_player())
        self.switch_player()
        if not self.board.get_valid_moves(self.current_player()):
            self.switch_player()
            if not self.board.get_valid_moves(self.current_player()):
                self.game_over = True
```

This change ensures that the game ends correctly when neither player can make a move, thus preventing any potential infinite loops and ensuring the game logic aligns with the rules of Reversi."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

Currently, it only switches players if the current player has no valid moves, but it does not check if the other player also has no valid moves, which should end the game.\n\nSuggested Revision:\nModify the handle_click method in the Game class to check if both players have no valid moves and set self.game_over to True in that case.\n\npython\ndef handle_click(self, x, y):\n    if self.game_over:\n        return\n    grid_x, grid_y = x // 100, y // 100\n    if self.board.is_valid_move(grid_x, grid_y, self.current_player()):\n        self.board.update_board(grid_x, grid_y, self.current_player())\n        self.switch_player()\n        if not self.board.get_valid_moves(self.current_player()):\n            self.switch_player()\n            if not self.board.get_valid_moves(self.current_player()):\n                self.game_over = True\n\n\nThis change ensures that the game ends correctly when neither player can make a move, thus preventing any potential infinite loops and ensuring the game logic aligns with the rules of Reversi.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a Reversi (Othello) board game. Two players alternate placing discs on an 8x8 grid, flipping the opponent’s discs that lie between the newly placed piece and existing pieces of the same color. The game ends when the board is full or no valid moves remain..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and follows the task requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the `handle_click` method in the `Game` class. The game does not handle the scenario where both players have no valid moves left, which should end the game. Currently, the game only checks for valid moves for the current player and switches to the next player if none are available, but it does not check if the game should end when neither player has valid moves.

### Suggested Revision:
In the `handle_click` method of the `Game` class, after switching players and checking for valid moves, add a check to see if both players have no valid moves, and if so, set `self.game_over` to `True`.

```python
def handle_click(self, x, y):
    if self.game_over:
        return
    grid_x, grid_y = x // 100, y // 100
    if self.board.is_valid_move(grid_x, grid_y, self.current_player()):
        self.board.update_board(grid_x, grid_y, self.current_player())
        self.switch_player()
        if not self.board.get_valid_moves(self.current_player()):
            self.switch_player()
            if not self.board.get_valid_moves(self.current_player()):
                self.game_over = True
```

This change ensures that the game ends correctly when no valid moves are available for both players, aligning with the task requirements.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is mostly well-structured and follows the task requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the `handle_click` method in the `Game` class. The game does not handle the scenario where both players have no valid moves left, which should end the game. Currently, the game only checks for valid moves for the current player and switches to the next player if none are available, but it does not check if the game should end when neither player has valid moves.

### Suggested Revision:
In the `handle_click` method of the `Game` class, after switching players and checking for valid moves, add a check to see if both players have no valid moves, and if so, set `self.game_over` to `True`.

```python
def handle_click(self, x, y):
    if self.game_over:
        return
    grid_x, grid_y = x // 100, y // 100
    if self.board.is_valid_move(grid_x, grid_y, self.current_player()):
        self.board.update_board(grid_x, grid_y, self.current_player())
        self.switch_player()
        if not self.board.get_valid_moves(self.current_player()):
            self.switch_player()
            if not self.board.get_valid_moves(self.current_player()):
                self.game_over = True
```

This change ensures that the game ends correctly when no valid moves are available for both players, aligning with the task requirements."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a Reversi (Othello) board game. Two players alternate placing discs on an 8x8 grid, flipping the opponent’s discs that lie between the newly placed piece and existing pieces of the same color. The game ends when the board is full or no valid moves remain..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code, the project uses the `pygame` library for creating the graphical interface of the Reversi (Othello) game. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should include the `pygame` package. Here is how the `requirements.txt` file should look:

```
pygame==2.1.2
```

This specifies that the project requires version 2.1.2 of the `pygame` library. You can adjust the version number if you are using a different version of `pygame` that is compatible with your project.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, the project uses the `pygame` library for creating the graphical interface of the Reversi (Othello) game. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should include the `pygame` package. Here is how the `requirements.txt` file should look:
```
pygame==2.1.2
```
This specifies that the project requires version 2.1.2 of the `pygame` library. You can adjust the version number if you are using a different version of `pygame` that is compatible with your project. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a Reversi (Othello) board game. Two players alternate placing discs on an 8x8 grid, flipping the opponent’s discs that lie between the newly placed piece and existing pieces of the same color. The game ends when the board is full or no valid moves remain..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

As the Chief Executive Officer, I can confirm that the Programmer has correctly identified the necessary dependency for the Reversi (Othello) game project. The `pygame` library is essential for creating the graphical interface of the game. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed include the `pygame` package. Here is the finalized `requirements.txt` file for the project:

```
pygame==2.1.2
```

This ensures that the project will have the required version of `pygame` to function correctly. If there are any additional dependencies or updates needed in the future, they can be added to this file to maintain the project's functionality and compatibility.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

# Reversi (Othello) Game

Welcome to the Reversi (Othello) game, a classic strategy board game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. This user manual will guide you through the installation process, introduce the main functions of the software, and explain how to play the game.

## Quick Install

To get started with the Reversi game, you need to install the required dependencies. The game is built using Python and Pygame, so make sure you have Python installed on your system.

### Step 1: Install Python

If you haven't already, download and install Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install Pygame

Once Python is installed, you can install Pygame using pip. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame==2.1.2
```

This will install the specific version of Pygame required for the game.

## Main Functions of the Software

The Reversi game software consists of several key components:

- **Game Board**: An 8x8 grid where players place their discs. The board is initialized with two black and two white discs in the center.

- **Players**: Two players take turns placing discs on the board. One player uses black discs, and the other uses white discs.

- **Game Logic**: The game handles the placement of discs, checks for valid moves, flips opponent discs, and determines when the game ends.

- **Graphical Interface**: The game uses Pygame to render the board and discs, providing a visual representation of the game state.

## How to Play

### Starting the Game

1. **Run the Game**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the game files, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will launch the game window.

2. **Game Interface**: The game window displays an 8x8 grid representing the board. The initial setup includes two black and two white discs in the center.

### Playing the Game

1. **Turn-Based Play**: Players take turns placing their discs on the board. The player with black discs goes first.

2. **Placing Discs**: Click on an empty square on the board to place your disc. The move is valid if it results in flipping at least one of the opponent's discs.

3. **Flipping Discs**: When a valid move is made, all opponent discs that lie in a straight line between the newly placed disc and another disc of the same color are flipped to the player's color.

4. **Switching Turns**: After a valid move, the turn switches to the other player. If a player has no valid moves, the turn automatically switches back.

5. **Game End**: The game ends when the board is full or neither player has a valid move. The player with the most discs on the board wins.

### Exiting the Game

To exit the game, simply close the game window or press the close button.

## Conclusion

Enjoy playing Reversi (Othello) and challenge your strategic thinking! If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out for support. Happy gaming!
