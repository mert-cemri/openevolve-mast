Given the task is to write a function in Python to solve a specific problem, the most suitable product modality would be "Application" since it involves implementing a software tool using Python. This aligns with the requirement to write and test code. What are your thoughts?

I agree with your assessment. Since the task involves writing and testing a Python function, the "Application" modality is indeed the most suitable choice. It allows us to focus on implementing the necessary code without any additional interfaces or presentations. Let's proceed with this modality.

To solve the task, we need to implement the function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` which determines if a given number `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. 

### Core Function

1. **Function: `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)`**
   - **Purpose:** To check if the number `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers.
   - **Logic:** 
     - A positive even number is any number that is divisible by 2 and greater than zero.
     - The smallest sum of four positive even numbers is 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.
     - Therefore, for any number less than 8, it is impossible to express it as the sum of four positive even numbers.
     - For numbers 8 and above, any even number can be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers by adjusting the values of the four numbers accordingly.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

DOCSTRING

'''

def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """
    Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.
    Example:
    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True
    """
    # The smallest sum of four positive even numbers is 8 (2 + 2 + 2 + 2)
    # Therefore, n must be at least 8 and even to be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers.
    return n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0

```

This implementation checks if `n` is at least 8 and even, which are the necessary conditions for `n` to be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix.

[2025-20-01 12:33:05 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 The Programmer has correctly identified that the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` does not require any external libraries or dependencies, as it is implemented using basic Python syntax. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty. This is a common scenario for simple Python scripts that do not utilize third-party packages.

As the CEO, I confirm that the solution provided by the Programmer is appropriate and aligns with the task requirements. The function is correctly implemented, and the `requirements.txt` file is accurately represented as empty. This ensures that the project is documented correctly and maintains simplicity without unnecessary dependencies.

If there are no further tasks or questions, I will consider this task complete.

# is_equal_to_sum_even User Manual

## Introduction

The `is_equal_to_sum_even` function is a simple Python utility designed to evaluate whether a given integer can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. This function is particularly useful in mathematical computations and problem-solving scenarios where such evaluations are required.

### Main Functionality

- **Function Name**: `is_equal_to_sum_even`
- **Purpose**: To determine if a given number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers.
- **Example Usage**:
  - `is_equal_to_sum_even(4)` returns `False`
  - `is_equal_to_sum_even(6)` returns `False`
  - `is_equal_to_sum_even(8)` returns `True`

## Installation

### Prerequisites

To use the `is_equal_to_sum_even` function, you need to have Python installed on your system. The function does not require any additional libraries or dependencies.

### Installing Python

1. **Windows**:
   - Download the latest version of Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions. Make sure to check the option to add Python to your PATH.

2. **macOS**:
   - You can install Python using Homebrew. Run the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     brew install python
     ```

3. **Linux**:
   - Use the package manager specific to your distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install python3
     ```

## Usage

Once Python is installed, you can use the `is_equal_to_sum_even` function by following these steps:

1. **Create a Python File**:
   - Create a file named `main.py` and copy the following code into it:

     ```python
     def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
         # The smallest sum of four positive even numbers is 8 (2 + 2 + 2 + 2)
         # Therefore, n must be at least 8 and even to be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers.
         return n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0
     ```

2. **Run the Function**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where your `main.py` file is located.
   - Run the Python script using the command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

3. **Test the Function**:
   - You can test the function by adding print statements in the `main.py` file. For example:
     ```python
     print(is_equal_to_sum_even(4))  # Output: False
     print(is_equal_to_sum_even(8))  # Output: True
     ```

## Conclusion

The `is_equal_to_sum_even` function is a straightforward tool for determining if a number can be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers. With no external dependencies, it is easy to integrate into any Python project. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to Python's official documentation or community forums for support.
