To complete the task, we need to focus on implementing the `split_words` function as described in the task. The task specifically asks for a solution without a graphical user interface (GUI), so we will only implement the necessary logic in a single Python file, `main.py`.

Here's the breakdown of the function we need to implement:

1. **Function Name**: `split_words`
2. **Parameters**: A single string `txt`.
3. **Logic**:
   - If the string contains whitespace, split the string on whitespace.
   - If there are no whitespaces but there are commas, split the string on commas.
   - If neither whitespaces nor commas are present, count the number of lowercase letters with an odd order in the alphabet (where 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, ..., 'z' is 25).

Now, let's implement the code in `main.py`.

FILENAME

```python
# main.py

'''
Given a string of words, return a list of words split on whitespace, if no whitespaces exists in the text you
should split on commas ',' if no commas exists you should return the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the
alphabet, ord('a') = 0, ord('b') = 1, ... ord('z') = 25
Examples
split_words("Hello world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]
split_words("Hello,world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]
split_words("abcdef") == 3 
'''

def split_words(txt):
    # Check if there are any whitespace characters
    if ' ' in txt:
        return txt.split()
    # Check if there are any commas
    elif ',' in txt:
        return txt.split(',')
    else:
        # Count lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet
        odd_count = 0
        for char in txt:
            if char.islower():
                order = ord(char) - ord('a')
                if order % 2 == 1:  # Check if the order is odd
                    odd_count += 1
        return odd_count

# Example usage
print(split_words("Hello world!"))  # ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]
print(split_words("Hello,world!"))  # ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]
print(split_words("abcdef"))        # ➞ 3
```

This code implements the `split_words` function according to the specified requirements. It first checks for whitespace, then for commas, and finally counts the lowercase letters with odd orders if neither is present.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Split Words Application

This application provides a simple function to process a string of words. It splits the string based on specific conditions and returns either a list of words or a count of specific characters. 

## Main Functionality

The main function of this application is `split_words(txt)`, which operates as follows:

1. **Whitespace Splitting**: If the input string contains whitespace, the function splits the string into a list of words based on the whitespace.

2. **Comma Splitting**: If there are no whitespace characters but there are commas, the function splits the string into a list of words based on the commas.

3. **Odd Order Count**: If neither whitespace nor commas are present, the function counts the number of lowercase letters in the string that have an odd order in the alphabet (where 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, ..., 'z' is 25) and returns this count.

### Examples

- `split_words("Hello world!")` returns `["Hello", "world!"]`
- `split_words("Hello,world!")` returns `["Hello", "world!"]`
- `split_words("abcdef")` returns `3`

## Installation

This application does not require any external dependencies. You can simply download the `main.py` file and run it using Python.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Use

1. **Download the Code**: Save the `main.py` file to your local machine.

2. **Run the Code**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Test the Function**: You can test the function by modifying the example usage at the bottom of the `main.py` file or by calling the `split_words(txt)` function with different input strings.

## Additional Information

This application is designed to be simple and efficient, focusing on processing strings based on specific conditions. It is suitable for educational purposes or as a utility function in larger projects where text processing is required.

For further assistance or inquiries, please contact our support team.
