To solve the task, we need to implement the `change_base` function that converts a given integer `x` to a specified base and returns the string representation of the number in that base. The base is less than 10, which simplifies the conversion process as we only need to handle digits 0-9.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we will implement this:

1. **Function Name**: `change_base`
   - **Purpose**: Convert a given integer `x` to a specified base and return its string representation.
   
2. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize an empty string to store the result.
   - Use a loop to divide the number `x` by the base repeatedly.
   - In each iteration, append the remainder of the division to the result string.
   - Reverse the result string at the end to get the correct representation.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python

'''

Change numerical base of input number x to base.
Return string representation after the conversion.
Base numbers are less than 10.

'''

def change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str:
    if x == 0:
        return "0"
    
    result = ""
    while x > 0:
        remainder = x % base
        result = str(remainder) + result
        x = x // base
    
    return result

# Example usage:
# print(change_base(8, 3))  # Output: '22'
# print(change_base(8, 2))  # Output: '1000'
# print(change_base(7, 2))  # Output: '111'

```

This code defines the `change_base` function that performs the base conversion as described. The function handles the conversion by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting the remainders, which are then reversed to form the final result. The function also handles the edge case where the input number is zero.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The Programmer has correctly identified that the provided code does not require any external libraries or packages to function. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, as there are no dependencies needed for this project. This is a straightforward implementation that only relies on Python's built-in capabilities.

If there are no further tasks or questions, I will consider this matter resolved and terminate the conversation.

# Change Base User Manual

## Introduction

The `change_base` function is a simple Python utility designed to convert a given integer from its current numerical base to another specified base. This function is particularly useful for applications requiring base conversions, such as computer science education, digital electronics, and data encoding.

### Main Functionality

- **Function Name:** `change_base`
- **Purpose:** Converts an integer from its current base to a specified base and returns the result as a string.
- **Parameters:**
  - `x` (int): The integer to be converted.
  - `base` (int): The base to which the integer should be converted. The base must be less than 10.
- **Returns:** A string representation of the number in the new base.

### Example Usage

```python
>>> change_base(8, 3)
'22'
>>> change_base(8, 2)
'1000'
>>> change_base(7, 2)
'111'
```

## Installation

To use the `change_base` function, you need to have Python installed on your system. The function does not require any external libraries or dependencies beyond the standard Python library.

### Quick Install

1. **Install Python:**
   - Download and install Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Type `python --version` to ensure Python is installed correctly.

## How to Use

1. **Create a Python File:**
   - Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice.
   - Create a new file named `main.py`.

2. **Implement the Function:**
   - Copy and paste the following code into `main.py`:

   ```python
   def change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str:
       if x == 0:
           return "0"
       result = ""
       while x > 0:
           remainder = x % base
           result = str(remainder) + result
           x = x // base
       return result
   ```

3. **Run the Function:**
   - Save the file and open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing `main.py`.
   - Run the script using the command: `python main.py`.
   - You can test the function by calling it with different arguments in the Python interactive shell or by adding test cases in the script.

## Documentation

For further details on Python programming and base conversions, you can refer to the following resources:

- [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [Base Conversion in Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation)

This manual provides all necessary information to install, use, and understand the `change_base` function. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please contact our support team.
