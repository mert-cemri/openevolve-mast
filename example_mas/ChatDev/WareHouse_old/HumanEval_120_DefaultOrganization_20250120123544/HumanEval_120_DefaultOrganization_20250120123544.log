Given the task is to write software code to solve a specific problem, I believe the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This would allow us to implement the necessary code in Python, which aligns with the task requirements. What are your thoughts?

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To solve the task, we need to implement the `maximum` function in Python. The function should return a sorted list of the k largest numbers from the input array. Since the task specifies not to implement a GUI and only to write the necessary code, we will focus on the core functionality without any graphical interface.

Here's the plan:

1. **Function Name**: `maximum`
   - **Purpose**: To find and return a sorted list of the k largest numbers from the input array.

2. **Steps**:
   - Sort the array in descending order.
   - Select the first k elements from the sorted array.
   - Sort these k elements in ascending order before returning.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python

'''

Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list 
of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.

Example 1:

    Input: arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3
    Output: [-4, -3, 5]

Example 2:

    Input: arr = [4, -4, 4], k = 2
    Output: [4, 4]

Example 3:

    Input: arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1
    Output: [2]

Note:
    1. The length of the array will be in the range of [1, 1000].
    2. The elements in the array will be in the range of [-1000, 1000].
    3. 0 <= k <= len(arr)

'''

def maximum(arr, k):
    # Sort the array in descending order
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    # Take the first k elements
    max_k_elements = sorted_arr[:k]
    # Sort these k elements in ascending order
    return sorted(max_k_elements)

```

This code will correctly implement the functionality as described in the task. It sorts the array to find the k largest elements and then returns them sorted in ascending order.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The function `maximum` only utilizes Python's built-in functions such as `sorted()`, which do not require any additional dependencies. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no external dependencies needed.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

As the Chief Executive Officer, I agree with the Programmer's assessment. The provided code in `main.py` does not utilize any external libraries or packages, as it only uses Python's built-in functions. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would indeed be empty, indicating that no additional packages are required for the project to run properly.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

```

This empty file signifies that there are no external dependencies needed for the project. If any future changes to the code introduce external libraries, the `requirements.txt` file should be updated accordingly to include those dependencies.

# Maximum K Elements Finder

This software provides a simple utility function to find the maximum `k` elements from a given list of integers. The function returns these elements sorted in ascending order, which can be useful for various applications where you need to identify and sort the top values from a dataset.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this software is encapsulated in the `maximum` function, which performs the following tasks:

1. **Input**: Accepts an array `arr` of integers and a positive integer `k`.
2. **Processing**: 
   - Sorts the array in descending order to identify the largest elements.
   - Selects the top `k` elements from this sorted array.
   - Sorts these `k` elements in ascending order.
3. **Output**: Returns a sorted list of the maximum `k` numbers from the input array.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example 1
arr = [-3, -4, 5]
k = 3
print(maximum(arr, k))  # Output: [-4, -3, 5]

# Example 2
arr = [4, -4, 4]
k = 2
print(maximum(arr, k))  # Output: [4, 4]

# Example 3
arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1]
k = 1
print(maximum(arr, k))  # Output: [2]
```

## Installation

This software is written in Python and does not require any external dependencies beyond the standard Python library. To use this software, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   - Clone or download the repository containing the `main.py` file to your local machine.

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Navigate to the directory containing `main.py`.
   - Execute the script using Python:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

3. **Integrate the Function**:
   - You can also import the `maximum` function into your own projects by copying the function definition from `main.py` into your codebase.

## Documentation

For further details on how the function works or to contribute to the project, please refer to the comments within the `main.py` file. The function is designed to be straightforward and easy to integrate into larger projects.

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to reach out through the project's repository or contact the development team.
