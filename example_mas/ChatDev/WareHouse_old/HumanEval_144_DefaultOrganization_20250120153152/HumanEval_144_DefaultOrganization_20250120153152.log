[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.

To solve the task, we need to implement the `simplify` function in Python. The function should determine if the product of two fractions, given as strings, results in a whole number. Since the task specifies not to implement a GUI, we will focus solely on the logic required for the `simplify` function.

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. **Parse the Fractions**: Convert the string representation of fractions into numerators and denominators.
2. **Multiply the Fractions**: Multiply the numerators and denominators separately.
3. **Check for Whole Number**: Determine if the resulting fraction is a whole number by checking if the numerator is divisible by the denominator.

Now, let's implement the `simplify` function in the `main.py` file.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

```

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `simplify` uses only basic Python operations and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

As the Chief Executive Officer, I can confirm that the Programmer's assessment is correct. The `simplify` function in `main.py` does not require any external libraries or dependencies beyond the standard Python library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed for the project to run properly.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

# Simplify Function User Manual

Welcome to the user manual for the `simplify` function. This software is designed to evaluate whether the product of two fractions results in a whole number. This document will guide you through the installation process, introduce the main functionality of the software, and provide instructions on how to use it.

## Quick Install

To use the `simplify` function, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can run the script directly as there are no additional dependencies required for this function.

## 🤔 What is this?

The `simplify` function is a utility that checks if the product of two fractions, provided as strings, results in a whole number. This can be particularly useful in mathematical computations where simplification of fractions is required.

### Main Functionality

- **Fraction Multiplication and Simplification**: The function takes two fractions in string format, multiplies them, and checks if the result is a whole number.

### Example Usage

The function is defined as follows:

```python
def simplify(x, n):
    """Your task is to implement a function that will simplify the expression
    x * n. The function returns True if x * n evaluates to a whole number and False
    otherwise. Both x and n, are string representation of a fraction, and have the following format,
    <numerator>/<denominator> where both numerator and denominator are positive whole numbers.
    You can assume that x, and n are valid fractions, and do not have zero as denominator.
    simplify("1/5", "5/1") = True
    simplify("1/6", "2/1") = False
    simplify("7/10", "10/2") = False
    """
    # Parse the fractions
    num1, denom1 = map(int, x.split('/'))
    num2, denom2 = map(int, n.split('/'))
    # Multiply the fractions
    numerator = num1 * num2
    denominator = denom1 * denom2
    # Check if the result is a whole number
    return numerator % denominator == 0
```

### How to Use

1. **Input**: Provide two fractions as strings in the format `<numerator>/<denominator>`.
   
2. **Output**: The function returns `True` if the product of the two fractions is a whole number, and `False` otherwise.

3. **Example**:
   - `simplify("1/5", "5/1")` returns `True` because the product is 1, which is a whole number.
   - `simplify("1/6", "2/1")` returns `False` because the product is 1/3, which is not a whole number.
   - `simplify("7/10", "10/2")` returns `False` because the product is 7/2, which is not a whole number.

## 📖 Documentation

For further information and updates, please refer to the official documentation or contact our support team. This function is designed to be simple and efficient, ensuring quick and accurate results for fraction multiplication and simplification tasks.
