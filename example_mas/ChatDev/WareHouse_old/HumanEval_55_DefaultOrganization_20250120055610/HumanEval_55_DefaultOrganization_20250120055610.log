Given the task is to write a piece of software code to solve a specific problem, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to focus on implementing the necessary code without any additional interfaces or formats. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, we need to implement the Fibonacci function in Python. The task specifically asks for the implementation of the Fibonacci function without any GUI or additional files. Therefore, we will focus on writing the necessary code in a single file, `main.py`, to compute the n-th Fibonacci number.

Here is the implementation of the Fibonacci function in Python:

```

This code defines a function `fib` that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number using an iterative approach. The function handles edge cases where `n` is less than or equal to zero by raising a `ValueError`. It also includes a simple test using Python's `doctest` module to verify that the function works as expected for the given examples.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            

def fib(n: int):
    """Return n-th Fibonacci number.
    >>> fib(10)
    55
    >>> fib(1)

    >>> fib(8)
    21
    """
.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

As the Chief Executive Officer, I concur with the Programmer's assessment. The provided code for calculating the n-th Fibonacci number does not utilize any external libraries or packages. Therefore, there are no additional dependencies required for the project to run properly. The `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, indicating that no external packages are needed. Here is how it should look:

```
# requirements.txt
# No external dependencies required for this project.
```

This ensures that anyone using the project understands that no additional installations are necessary beyond a standard Python environment.

# Fibonacci Calculator

This software module provides a simple function to compute the n-th Fibonacci number. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, with no external dependencies required.

## Main Function

The main function provided by this software is `fib(n: int) -> int`. This function calculates and returns the n-th Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. In this implementation, the sequence starts with 1 and 1.

### Function Signature

```python
def fib(n: int) -> int:
    """Return n-th Fibonacci number."""
```

### Example Usage

Here are some examples of how to use the `fib` function:

```python
>>> fib(10)
55
>>> fib(1)
1
>>> fib(8)
21
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it easy to set up and use. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository containing the `main.py` file.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

3. **Run the Script**: You can run the script directly using Python. There are no additional installation steps required.

## How to Use

1. **Open a Terminal**: Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. **Navigate to the Script Location**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory containing `main.py`.

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script using Python to test the function with the built-in doctests.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will run the doctests included in the `fib` function's docstring to verify that the function works as expected.

4. **Use the Function in Your Code**: You can import the `fib` function into your own Python scripts to compute Fibonacci numbers as needed.

   ```python
   from main import fib

   result = fib(10)
   print(result)  # Output: 55
   ```

## Documentation

The function is documented within the code using Python docstrings. You can view these docstrings for more information on how the function works and its expected input and output.

For any further questions or support, please refer to the comments within the code or contact the development team.
