To solve the task, we need to implement a function `order_by_points` that sorts a list of integers based on the sum of their digits. If two numbers have the same digit sum, they should maintain their original order (stable sorting).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Calculate the Sum of Digits**: We need a helper function to calculate the sum of the digits of a number. This function should handle both positive and negative numbers.

2. **Sort the List**: Use Python's built-in sorting capabilities, specifically the `sorted()` function, which allows us to specify a custom key. The key will be the sum of the digits.

3. **Stable Sorting**: Python's `sorted()` function is stable, meaning that it maintains the relative order of records with equal keys. This is exactly what we need for this task.

Now, let's implement the solution in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python

'''

This module contains the implementation of the function `order_by_points`
which sorts a list of integers based on the sum of their digits.

'''

def digit_sum(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of the digits of a number.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The number whose digits will be summed.
    
    Returns:
    int: The sum of the digits.
    """
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(n)))

def order_by_points(nums):
    """
    Sorts the given list of integers in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.
    If there are several items with similar sum of their digits, order them based on their index
    in the original list.

    Args:
    nums (list of int): The list of integers to sort.

    Returns:
    list of int: The sorted list of integers.
    
    Examples:
    >>> order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12])
    [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]
    >>> order_by_points([])
    []
    """
    return sorted(nums, key=digit_sum)

```

This implementation includes a helper function `digit_sum` to calculate the sum of digits for each number, and the main function `order_by_points` which sorts the list using this helper function as the key. The sorting is stable, so numbers with the same digit sum maintain their original order.

    """
    return sorted(nums, key=digit_sum)

```

This implementation includes a helper function `digit_sum` to calculate the sum of digits for each number, and the main function `order_by_points` which sorts the list using this helper function as the key. The sorting is stable, so numbers with the same digit sum maintain their original order.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The code does not correctly handle the case where several items have the same sum of their digits. The current implementation will not maintain the original order for items with the same digit sum because the `sorted` function is stable, but it doesn't explicitly use the original index as a secondary sort key. To fix this, modify the sorting key to include the index as a secondary criterion.

```python
def order_by_points(nums):
    """
    Sorts the given list of integers in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.
    If there are several items with similar sum of their digits, order them based on their index

    nums (list of int): The list of integers to sort.
    Returns:
    list of int: The sorted list of integers.
    Examples:
    >>> order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12])

    >>> order_by_points([])
    []
    """
    return sorted(nums, key=lambda x: (digit_sum(x), nums.index(x)))
```

This change ensures that if two numbers have the same digit sum, they will be sorted according to their original order in the list.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Based on the provided code, there are no external libraries or packages used. The function `order_by_points` and its helper function `digit_sum` rely solely on Python's built-in functions and capabilities. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no additional dependencies required.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external libraries or packages used. The function `order_by_points` and its helper function `digit_sum` rely solely on Python's built-in functions and capabilities. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no additional dependencies required.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
