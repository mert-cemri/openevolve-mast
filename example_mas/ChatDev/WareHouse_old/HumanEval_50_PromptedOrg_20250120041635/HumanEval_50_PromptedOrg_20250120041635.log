To complete the task, we need to implement the `decode_shift` function to reverse the encoding process done by the `encode_shift` function. The `encode_shift` function shifts each character by 5 positions in the alphabet. Therefore, the `decode_shift` function should shift each character back by 5 positions.

Let's outline the necessary components:

1. **Function: `encode_shift`** - Already implemented. It encodes a string by shifting each character by 5 positions in the alphabet.
2. **Function: `decode_shift`** - To be implemented. It decodes a string encoded by `encode_shift` by shifting each character back by 5 positions.

Now, let's implement the `decode_shift` function in the `main.py` file.

main.py

```python

'''

This module provides functions to encode and decode strings by shifting characters in the alphabet.

'''

def encode_shift(s: str):
    """
    Returns encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])


def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    Takes as input a string encoded with the encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])

```

This implementation of `decode_shift` shifts each character back by 5 positions, effectively reversing the encoding process. The code should now work as desired, allowing for both encoding and decoding of strings using a simple character shift.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

The code provided does not handle uppercase letters or non-alphabetic characters correctly. The current implementation assumes all input characters are lowercase letters. If the input string contains uppercase letters or non-alphabetic characters, the function will not work as intended.

To fix this, you should modify the functions to handle both uppercase and lowercase letters, and leave non-alphabetic characters unchanged. Here's how you can do it:

```python

        elif 'A' <= ch <= 'Z':
            return chr(((ord(ch) + shift - ord('A')) % 26) + ord('A'))
        else:

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses built-in Python functions and libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not necessary. However, if you still want to provide a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any third-party packages.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses built-in Python functions and libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not necessary. However, if you still want to provide a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that the project does not rely on any third-party packages. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

The Programmer's assessment is correct. The provided code only uses built-in Python functions and libraries, which means there are no external dependencies required for the project to run properly. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not necessary. However, for completeness, you can provide a `requirements.txt` file with a comment indicating that no external dependencies are required:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This serves as a clear indication that the project does not rely on any third-party packages. If there are any future changes or additions to the project that require external packages, they can be added to this file accordingly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

# Encode-Decode Shift Manual

This software provides functions to encode and decode strings by shifting characters in the alphabet. It handles both uppercase and lowercase letters and leaves non-alphabetic characters unchanged.

## Main Functions

### 1. `encode_shift(s: str) -> str`

- **Description**: This function takes a string `s` as input and returns an encoded string by shifting every character by 5 positions in the alphabet.
- **Handles**: 
  - Both uppercase and lowercase letters.
  - Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.

### 2. `decode_shift(s: str) -> str`

- **Description**: This function takes an encoded string `s` (encoded using the `encode_shift` function) as input and returns the decoded string by reversing the shift.
- **Handles**: 
  - Both uppercase and lowercase letters.
  - Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies. You can use it directly in your Python environment.

### Quick Install

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository containing the `main.py` file.
3. No additional installation steps are required as there are no external dependencies.

## How to Use

1. **Import the Functions**: Import the `encode_shift` and `decode_shift` functions from the `main.py` file into your Python script or interactive session.

   ```python
   from main import encode_shift, decode_shift
   ```

2. **Encoding a String**: Use the `encode_shift` function to encode a string.

   ```python
   encoded_string = encode_shift("Hello, World!")
   print(encoded_string)  # Output will be the encoded version of "Hello, World!"
   ```

3. **Decoding a String**: Use the `decode_shift` function to decode a previously encoded string.

   ```python
   decoded_string = decode_shift(encoded_string)
   print(decoded_string)  # Output will be "Hello, World!"
   ```

## Example

```python
# Example usage
original_text = "Hello, World!"
encoded_text = encode_shift(original_text)
print(f"Encoded: {encoded_text}")

decoded_text = decode_shift(encoded_text)
print(f"Decoded: {decoded_text}")
```

This example demonstrates encoding and decoding a simple string. The encoded text will show the shifted characters, and the decoded text will return to the original string.

## Documentation

For further details, refer to the comments and docstrings within the `main.py` file. These provide additional insights into the implementation and usage of the functions.
