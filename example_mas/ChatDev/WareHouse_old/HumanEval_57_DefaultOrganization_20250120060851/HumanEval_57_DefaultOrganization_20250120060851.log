Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and fixing a piece of software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to focus on the functionality and ensure the code works as intended without any additional presentation layers. What are your thoughts?

To complete the task, we need to fix the `monotonic` function in Python to check if a list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. The task specifies not to implement a GUI, so we will focus solely on the function logic. Here's the plan:

### Core Function:
- **monotonic(l: list):** This function will determine if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. It will return `True` if the list is either monotonically increasing or decreasing, otherwise `False`.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to check if a list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.

'''

def monotonic(l: list):
    """Return True if list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.
    >>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
    True
    >>> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])
    False
    >>> monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])
    True
    """
    if not l:
        return True

    increasing = decreasing = True

    for i in range(1, len(l)):
        if l[i] > l[i - 1]:
            decreasing = False
        if l[i] < l[i - 1]:
            increasing = False

    return increasing or decreasing
```

This function checks each pair of consecutive elements in the list to determine if the list is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing. If either condition holds true for the entire list, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `monotonic` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not require any additional Python packages to run.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `monotonic` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that the project does not require any additional Python packages to run. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Monotonic List Checker

This software provides a simple utility function to determine if a list of numbers is monotonically increasing or decreasing. It is implemented in Python and does not require any external dependencies.

## Quick Install

Since there are no external dependencies required for this software, you can simply run the Python script without any additional installation steps.

## 🤔 What is this?

The Monotonic List Checker is a Python function that checks if the elements of a list are either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing. This can be useful in various data analysis tasks where the order of data points is significant.

### Main Functionality

- **monotonic(l: list)**: This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns `True` if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and `False` otherwise.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import monotonic

# Example 1: Monotonically increasing list
print(monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20]))  # Output: True

# Example 2: Non-monotonic list
print(monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10]))  # Output: False

# Example 3: Monotonically decreasing list
print(monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10]))  # Output: True
```

## 📖 Documentation

### Function Details

- **monotonic(l: list)**:
  - **Parameters**: 
    - `l` (list): A list of numbers to be checked for monotonicity.
  - **Returns**: 
    - `bool`: `True` if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, `False` otherwise.
  - **Examples**:
    - `monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])` returns `True`
    - `monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])` returns `False`
    - `monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])` returns `True`

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Run the Script**: Use a Python interpreter to run the `main.py` script.
3. **Test the Function**: You can test the function using the examples provided above or with your own list of numbers.

This software is designed to be simple and efficient, making it easy to integrate into larger projects or use as a standalone utility.
