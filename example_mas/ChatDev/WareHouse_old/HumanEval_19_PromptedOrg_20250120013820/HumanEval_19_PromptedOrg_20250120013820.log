To solve the task, we need to implement the `sort_numbers` function that takes a space-delimited string of numerals (from 'zero' to 'nine') and returns a string with those numerals sorted in ascending order. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Function `sort_numbers`:** This function will:
   - Map each numeral to its corresponding integer value.
   - Sort the numerals based on their integer values.
   - Return the sorted numerals as a space-delimited string.

Let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

```python

This module provides a function to sort numerals from 'zero' to 'nine' in ascending order.

    Return the string with numbers sorted from smallest to largest.
    
    >>> sort_numbers('three one five')
    'one three five'
    """
    # Mapping of numerals to their corresponding integer values
    numeral_to_int = {
        'zero': 0,
        'one': 1,
        'two': 2,
        'three': 3,
        'four': 4,
        'five': 5,
        'six': 6,
        'seven': 7,
        'eight': 8,
        'nine': 9
    }
    
    # Split the input string into a list of numerals
    numeral_list = numbers.split()
    
    # Sort the list of numerals based on their integer values
    sorted_numerals = sorted(numeral_list, key=lambda x: numeral_to_int[x])
    
    # Join the sorted numerals into a space-delimited string
    return ' '.join(sorted_numerals)

```

This code defines the `sort_numbers` function, which maps each numeral to its integer equivalent, sorts the numerals, and returns them in a sorted order. The function is designed to handle the input as specified and produce the correct output.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# Sort Numbers User Manual

## Introduction

This software provides a function to sort numerals from 'zero' to 'nine' in ascending order. It is designed to take a space-delimited string of numerals and return a string with the numbers sorted from smallest to largest. This can be particularly useful in applications where you need to organize or display numbers in a human-readable format.

## Main Function

### `sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str`

- **Description**: This function takes a space-delimited string of numerals (from 'zero' to 'nine') and returns a string with the numerals sorted in ascending order.
- **Input**: A string containing space-delimited numerals.
- **Output**: A string with the numerals sorted in ascending order.

#### Example

```python
>>> sort_numbers('three one five')
'one three five'
```

## Installation

### Environment Setup

To use this software, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This software does not require any external Python packages, so there is no need for a `requirements.txt` file. However, it is always a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage your Python projects.

#### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: If the code is hosted in a repository, clone it to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.

3. **Run the Code**: You can test the function by running a Python interpreter and calling the `sort_numbers` function with your desired input.

```bash
python
```

```python
from main import sort_numbers
print(sort_numbers('three one five'))
```

This will output:
```
one three five
```

## Documentation

For further documentation and examples, please refer to the comments and docstrings within the `main.py` file. These provide detailed information on how the function works and how it can be used in different scenarios.

## Support

For any issues or questions, please contact our support team at support@chatdev.com. We are here to help you with any problems or inquiries you may have regarding the software.
