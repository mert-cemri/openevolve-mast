# Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculator

This software provides a simple and efficient way to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers without leaving a remainder.

## Main Function

The main function of this software is:

- `greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int`: This function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their greatest common divisor. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD.

### Example Usage

```python
>>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
1
>>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
5
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to set up and use. You only need Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the repository**: If the code is hosted on a version control system, clone the repository to your local machine.

3. **Navigate to the project directory**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.

## How to Use

1. **Open the terminal**: Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.

2. **Run the script**: Execute the script using Python by entering the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Use the function**: You can use the `greatest_common_divisor` function within the Python environment by importing it from the `main.py` file or by directly calling it if you're running the script interactively.

## Documentation

For further details on how the Euclidean algorithm works or to understand the implementation better, you can refer to the comments within the `main.py` file. The code is well-documented to help you understand each step of the algorithm.
