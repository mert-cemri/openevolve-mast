Given the task of writing software code to solve a specific problem, I believe the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task involves implementing a piece of software code, which aligns with the capabilities of an application to execute and demonstrate the functionality of the code. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" is indeed the most appropriate product modality for this task, as it involves writing and executing software code to solve a specific problem. This will allow us to focus on the functionality and correctness of the code without any additional interfaces or presentations.

To address the customer's task, we need to implement the `special_factorial` function in Python. The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus solely on the function implementation. The function will compute the Brazilian factorial as described. Here's the plan:

### Core Function:
- **special_factorial(n):** This function will calculate the Brazilian factorial of a given integer `n`. It will multiply the factorials of all integers from `n` down to `1`.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

### main.py

```python
'''

This module contains the implementation of the special_factorial function,
which calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given integer.

'''

import math

def special_factorial(n):
    """The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
    brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
    where n > 0

    For example:
    >>> special_factorial(4)
    288

    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
    factorial of this integer.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be greater than 0")
    
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= math.factorial(i)
    
    return result

# Example usage:
# print(special_factorial(4))  # Output: 288
```

### Explanation:
- **Importing `math`:** We use the `math.factorial` function to compute the factorial of each integer from `1` to `n`.
- **Loop from 1 to n:** We iterate over each integer from `1` to `n`, compute its factorial, and multiply it to the result.
- **Error Handling:** We raise a `ValueError` if `n` is less than or equal to zero, as the Brazilian factorial is only defined for positive integers.

This code will correctly compute the Brazilian factorial as specified by the customer.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, the only external library used is `math`, which is a standard library in Python and does not need to be included in a `requirements.txt` file. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no additional dependencies required beyond the standard Python library.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
If you plan to use any additional libraries in the future, you can add them to this file with their respective versions. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Special Factorial Calculator

This software provides a function to calculate the Brazilian factorial of a given integer. The Brazilian factorial is a unique mathematical operation that multiplies the factorials of all integers from 1 to n.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `special_factorial(n)`, which calculates the Brazilian factorial of the input integer `n`.

### Function Definition

```python
def special_factorial(n):
    """
    The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
    brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
    where n > 0

    >>> special_factorial(4)
    288

    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
    factorial of this integer.
    """
```

### Example Usage

To use the `special_factorial` function, simply call it with a positive integer as an argument:

```python
print(special_factorial(4))  # Output: 288
```

## Installation and Environment Setup

This software does not require any external dependencies. It is implemented purely in Python using the standard library. To run the software, ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Python Installation**: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the `main.py` file to your local machine.

3. **Run the Code**: Navigate to the directory containing `main.py` and execute the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Documentation

This software is straightforward and does not require extensive documentation beyond this manual. The function is designed to be simple and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in `math.factorial` function to compute the factorial of each integer.

# Special Factorial Calculator

This software provides a function to calculate the Brazilian factorial of a given integer. The Brazilian factorial is a unique mathematical operation that multiplies the factorials of all integers from 1 to n.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `special_factorial(n)`, which calculates the Brazilian factorial of the input integer `n`.

### Function Definition

```python
def special_factorial(n):
    """
    The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
    brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
    where n > 0

    For example:
    >>> special_factorial(4)
    288

    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
    factorial of this integer.
    """
