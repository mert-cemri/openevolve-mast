### `largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int`

- **Description**: This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest prime factor of `n`. It assumes that `n` is greater than 1 and is not a prime number itself.
- **Example Usage**:
  ```python
  >>> largest_prime_factor(13195)
  29
  >>> largest_prime_factor(2048)
  2
  ```

## Installation
