To address the customer's task, we need to implement a function that converts a given string into its MD5 hash equivalent. The task specifies that if the input string is empty, the function should return `None`. We will implement this functionality in a single Python file named `main.py`. Since the task explicitly states not to implement a GUI, we will focus solely on the core functionality.

Here is the plan for the `main.py` file:

1. **Function: `string_to_md5`**
   - **Purpose**: Convert a given string to its MD5 hash.
   - **Parameters**: `text` (string) - the input string to be hashed.
   - **Returns**: The MD5 hash of the input string, or `None` if the input is an empty string.

Now, let's implement the code in `main.py`.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to convert a string into its MD5 hash equivalent.

'''

import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text):
    """
    Given a string 'text', return its md5 hash equivalent string.
    If 'text' is an empty string, return None.

    >>> string_to_md5('Hello world') == '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'
    """
    if not text:
        return None
    # Create an md5 hash object
    md5_hash = hashlib.md5()
    # Update the hash object with the bytes of the text
    md5_hash.update(text.encode('utf-8'))
    # Return the hexadecimal digest of the hash
    return md5_hash.hexdigest()

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(string_to_md5('Hello world'))  # Should print: 3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62
```

This code uses Python's built-in `hashlib` library to compute the MD5 hash of a given string. The function checks if the input string is empty and returns `None` in that case. Otherwise, it computes and returns the MD5 hash in hexadecimal format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Based on the provided code, the only external library used is `hashlib`, which is part of Python's standard library. Therefore, there are no additional dependencies required for this project. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for completeness or future use, you can include the Python version as a reference. Here's how you might write it:

```
# This project uses Python's standard library, no additional packages are required.
# Specify the Python version if needed
python_version >= 3.6
```

This file indicates that the project requires Python version 3.6 or higher, which is necessary for compatibility with the standard library features used in the code.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, the only external library used is `hashlib`, which is part of Python's standard library. Therefore, there are no additional dependencies required for this project. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for completeness or future use, you can include the Python version as a reference. Here's how you might write it:
```
# This project uses Python's standard library, no additional packages are required.
# Specify the Python version if needed
python_version >= 3.6
```
This file indicates that the project requires Python version 3.6 or higher, which is necessary for compatibility with the standard library features used in the code. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# String to MD5 Converter

This software module provides a simple function to convert a given string into its MD5 hash equivalent. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, using Python's standard library.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this module is `string_to_md5(text)`. This function takes a string as input and returns its MD5 hash as a hexadecimal string. If the input string is empty, the function returns `None`.

### Function Details

- **Function Name:** `string_to_md5`
- **Input:** A string `text`
- **Output:** A string representing the MD5 hash of the input, or `None` if the input is an empty string.

#### Example Usage

```python
from main import string_to_md5

# Example usage
result = string_to_md5('Hello world')
print(result)  # Output: 3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62
```

## Installation and Setup

This module requires Python version 3.6 or higher. It uses Python's standard library, so no additional packages are needed.

### Steps to Set Up the Environment

1. **Ensure Python is Installed:** Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Clone the Repository:** If this module is part of a larger project, clone the repository to your local machine.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory:** Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.

4. **Run the Script:** You can directly run the script using Python to see the function in action.

```bash
python main.py
```

This will execute the example usage in the `main.py` file and print the MD5 hash of 'Hello world'.

## Additional Information

- **Documentation:** This module is straightforward and does not require extensive documentation. The function is self-contained and relies solely on Python's built-in `hashlib` library.

- **Support:** For any issues or questions, please contact the development team through the appropriate channels provided by the organization.
