    "Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes
    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.

    The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],
    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].

    Example 1:

        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

    "Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes
    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The function `pluck` only utilizes basic Python functionality, which does not require any additional dependencies. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no packages to specify.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

# Pluck Function

This software provides a simple utility function called `pluck` that is designed to work with arrays of non-negative integers. The primary purpose of this function is to identify and return the smallest even number from the array, along with its index. If no even numbers are present, it returns an empty list.

## Main Functionality

### pluck(arr)

- **Description**: 
  - This function takes an array of non-negative integers and returns the smallest even number along with its index in the array.
  - If there are multiple occurrences of the smallest even number, the function returns the one with the smallest index.
  - If the array is empty or contains no even numbers, the function returns an empty list.

- **Parameters**:
  - `arr`: A list of non-negative integers.

- **Returns**:
  - A list containing two elements: `[smallest_even_value, index]`.
  - Returns an empty list `[]` if no even numbers are found or if the input array is empty.

- **Examples**:
  - `pluck([4, 2, 3])` returns `[2, 1]`
  - `pluck([1, 2, 3])` returns `[2, 1]`
  - `pluck([])` returns `[]`
  - `pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2])` returns `[0, 1]`

# Pluck Function

This software provides a simple utility function called `pluck` that is designed to work with arrays of non-negative integers. The primary purpose of this function is to identify and return the smallest even number from the array, along with its index. If no even numbers are present, it returns an empty list.

## Main Functionality

### pluck(arr)

- **Description**: 
  - This function takes an array of non-negative integers and returns the smallest even number along with its index in the array.
  - If there are multiple occurrences of the smallest even number, the function returns the one with the smallest index.
  - If the array is empty or contains no even numbers, the function returns an empty list.

- **Parameters**:
  - `arr`: A list of non-negative integers.

- **Returns**:
  - A list containing two elements: `[smallest_even_value, index]`.
  - Returns an empty list `[]` if no even numbers are found or if the input array is empty.

- **Examples**:
  - `pluck([4, 2, 3])` returns `[2, 1]`
  - `pluck([1, 2, 3])` returns `[2, 1]`
  - `pluck([])` returns `[]`
  - `pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2])` returns `[0, 1]`
