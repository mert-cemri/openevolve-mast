Given the task at hand, which involves writing and testing a piece of software code, I believe the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a function in Python, which aligns with the capabilities of an application that can handle software tools and code execution. What are your thoughts?

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To complete the task, we need to implement the `select_words` function in Python. The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus solely on the logic needed to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the steps needed to implement this function:

1. **Function Purpose**: The `select_words` function will take a string `s` and a natural number `n` as input and return a list of words from `s` that contain exactly `n` consonants.

2. **Steps to Implement**:
   - Split the input string `s` into individual words.
   - Define a set of vowels to identify consonants easily.
   - For each word, count the number of consonants.
   - If the count of consonants matches `n`, add the word to the result list.
   - Return the result list.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the input string `s` is empty, return an empty list.
   - Assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.

Now, let's write the code for the `select_words` function in `main.py`.

MAIN.PY

```python

'''

Given a string s and a natural number n, implement a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s. If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list. Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.

'''

def select_words(s, n):
    # Define vowels
    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
    
    # Split the string into words
    words = s.split()
    
    # Initialize the result list
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each word
    for word in words:
        # Count consonants in the word
        consonant_count = sum(1 for char in word if char.isalpha() and char not in vowels)
        
        # If the consonant count matches n, add the word to the result
        if consonant_count == n:
            result.append(word)
    
    return result

```

This code defines the `select_words` function, which processes the input string `s` to find and return words with exactly `n` consonants. The function uses a set of vowels to differentiate consonants and iterates over each word to count consonants, adding words with the desired consonant count to the result list.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            
def select_words(s, n):
    """Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement 
    a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly 
    n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
    Examples:
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `select_words` utilizes only built-in Python functionalities, such as string manipulation and list operations, which do not require any additional libraries.

Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project should be empty, as there are no external dependencies needed. Here is how it would look:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project can run with a standard Python installation without any additional packages.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `select_words` utilizes only built-in Python functionalities, such as string manipulation and list operations, which do not require any additional libraries.
Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project should be empty, as there are no external dependencies needed. Here is how it would look:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that the project can run with a standard Python installation without any additional packages. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I concur with the Programmer's assessment. The code provided in `main.py` does not require any external libraries or packages beyond the standard Python library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, indicating that no additional dependencies are necessary for the project to run. Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```

    Examples:
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
    select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []
    select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
    select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]

# Select Words by Consonant Count

## Overview

The "Select Words by Consonant Count" software is a Python-based utility designed to extract words from a given string that contain a specified number of consonants. This tool is particularly useful for text analysis and linguistic research, where understanding the consonant structure of words is necessary.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this software is encapsulated in the `select_words` function. This function takes two inputs:
- A string `s` which contains words separated by spaces.
- A natural number `n` which specifies the exact number of consonants a word must have to be included in the output list.

The function returns a list of words from the input string that contain exactly `n` consonants, preserving the order in which they appear in the string.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example 1
result = select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4)
print(result)  # Output: ["little"]

# Example 2
result = select_words("Hello world", 4)
print(result)  # Output: ["world"]
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   Since there are no external dependencies, you can directly run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Input**: Ensure your input string contains only letters and spaces. The function assumes this format and does not handle punctuation or numbers.

2. **Call the Function**: Use the `select_words` function with your desired string and consonant count.

3. **Interpret the Results**: The function will return a list of words that match the specified consonant count. If no words match, it will return an empty list.

## Documentation

For further details and examples, refer to the in-line comments within the `main.py` file. This will provide additional context on how the function operates and its expected inputs and outputs.
