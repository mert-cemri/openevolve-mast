# Fibonacci Function User Manual

This manual provides instructions on how to use the Fibonacci function implemented in Python. The function calculates the n-th Fibonacci number, which is a number in the Fibonacci sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

## Main Function

The main function provided in this software is:

- `fib(n: int) -> int`: This function returns the n-th Fibonacci number. It takes an integer `n` as input and returns the corresponding Fibonacci number.

### Example Usage

```python
>>> fib(10)
55
>>> fib(1)
1
>>> fib(8)
21
```

## Installation

To use the Fibonacci function, you need to have Python installed on your system. The function does not require any additional dependencies, so you can directly use it in your Python environment.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or download the code**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the Fibonacci function code.

3. **Run the code**: You can run the code in a Python environment or script to calculate Fibonacci numbers.

## How to Use

1. **Open a Python environment**: You can use any Python IDE or the command line to run Python scripts.

2. **Import the function**: If you have saved the function in a file named `main.py`, you can import it using:
   ```python
   from main import fib
   ```

3. **Call the function**: Use the `fib` function by passing an integer `n` to get the n-th Fibonacci number:
   ```python
   result = fib(10)
   print(result)  # Output: 55
   ```

## Documentation

The Fibonacci function is straightforward and does not require additional libraries or complex setup. For further information on Python programming, you can refer to the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/).

This manual provides all necessary information to use the Fibonacci function effectively. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to Python community forums or resources for additional support.
