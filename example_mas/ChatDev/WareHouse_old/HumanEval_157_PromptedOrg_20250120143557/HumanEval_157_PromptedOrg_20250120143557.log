To solve the task, we need to implement a function `right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)` that checks if the given sides form a right-angled triangle. The function will use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Here are the steps to implement the function:

1. Identify the longest side, which should be the hypotenuse.
2. Check if the square of the longest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
3. Return `True` if the condition is met, otherwise return `False`.

Now, let's write the code for this function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''
main.py

This file contains the implementation of the function to determine if three given sides can form a right-angled triangle.
'''

def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''
    # Sort the sides to identify the hypotenuse
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    # Check the Pythagorean theorem
    return sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2

# Example usage:
# print(right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5))  # Should return True
# print(right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3))  # Should return False
```

This code will correctly determine if the given sides form a right-angled triangle by checking the Pythagorean theorem. The function sorts the sides to ensure the largest side is treated as the hypotenuse and then checks if the sum of the squares of the other two sides equals the square of the hypotenuse.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a conversation between two roles: Programmer: ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.

"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `right_angle_triangle` only uses basic Python operations and does not rely on any additional libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed for this project.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project

# Right Angle Triangle Checker

This software provides a simple function to determine if three given sides can form a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)`. This function takes three arguments, which represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. It returns `True` if the sides form a right-angled triangle and `False` otherwise.

### How It Works

The function works by sorting the sides to identify the hypotenuse (the longest side) and then checks if the Pythagorean theorem holds true for these sides. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

## Installation

This project does not require any external dependencies, so there is no need to install additional packages. You only need to have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

To use the `right_angle_triangle` function, follow these steps:

1. Open your Python environment (e.g., IDLE, PyCharm, VSCode, or terminal).

2. Copy the function code into your Python script or interactive shell:

    ```python
    def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
        '''
        Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
        sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
        A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
        90 degree.
        Example:
        right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
        right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
        '''
        # Sort the sides to identify the hypotenuse
        sides = sorted([a, b, c])
        # Check the Pythagorean theorem
        return sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2
    ```

3. Call the function with the side lengths you want to check. For example:

    ```python
    print(right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5))  # Output: True
    print(right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3))  # Output: False

 # Right Angle Triangle Checker

This software provides a simple function to determine if three given sides can form a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)`. This function takes three arguments, which represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. It returns `True` if the sides form a right-angled triangle and `False` otherwise.

### How It Works

The function works by sorting the sides to identify the hypotenuse (the longest side) and then checks if the Pythagorean theorem holds true for these sides. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

## Installation

This project does not require any external dependencies, so there is no need to install additional packages. You only need to have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

To use the `right_angle_triangle` function, follow these steps:

1. Open your Python environment (e.g., IDLE, PyCharm, VSCode, or terminal).

2. Copy the function code into your Python script or interactive shell:

    ```python
    def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
        '''
        Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
        sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
        A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
        90 degree.
        Example:
        right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
        right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
        '''
        # Sort the sides to identify the hypotenuse
        sides = sorted([a, b, c])
        # Check the Pythagorean theorem
        return sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2
    ```

3. Call the function with the side lengths you want to check. For example:

    ```python
    print(right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5))  # Output: True
    print(right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3))  # Output: False
    ```

## Conclusion

This software provides a straightforward method to check if three sides can form a right-angled triangle. It is easy to use and requires no additional setup beyond having Python installed.
