To solve the task, we need to implement the function `separate_paren_groups` in Python. The function should take a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses and return a list of those groups as separate strings. The groups are balanced and not nested within each other, and spaces in the input string should be ignored.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Name**: `separate_paren_groups`
   - **Purpose**: To separate groups of balanced parentheses from a given string and return them as a list of strings.

2. **Steps to Implement**:
   - Initialize an empty list to store the groups of parentheses.
   - Initialize a counter to track the balance of parentheses.
   - Initialize an empty string to build the current group of parentheses.
   - Iterate over each character in the input string:
     - If the character is an opening parenthesis '(', increment the counter and add the character to the current group.
     - If the character is a closing parenthesis ')', decrement the counter and add the character to the current group.
     - If the counter reaches zero (indicating a balanced group), add the current group to the list and reset the current group.
   - Return the list of groups.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file:

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to separate groups of balanced parentheses from a given string.

from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:

    separate those groups into separate strings and return the list of those.
    Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other.
    Ignore any spaces in the input string.
    
    >>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
    ['()', '(())', '(()())']
    """
    groups = []
    current_group = ''
    balance = 0
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == ' ':
            continue
        current_group += char
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        elif char == ')':
            balance -= 1
        
        if balance == 0 and current_group:
            groups.append(current_group)
            current_group = ''
    
    return groups
```

This code defines the `separate_paren_groups` function, which processes the input string to extract and return balanced groups of parentheses as specified.
