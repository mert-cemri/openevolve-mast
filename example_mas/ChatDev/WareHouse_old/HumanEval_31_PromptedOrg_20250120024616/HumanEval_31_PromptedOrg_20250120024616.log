Given the task is to write a function to determine if a number is prime, the most suitable product modality would be an Application. This is because the task involves implementing a software tool that performs a specific function, which aligns with the capabilities of an Application. What are your thoughts on this?

To solve the task, we need to implement the `is_prime` function in Python. The function should determine if a given number is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

### Core Function

- **Function Name**: `is_prime`
  - **Purpose**: To check if a given number is prime.
  - **Parameters**: 
    - `n` (int): The number to check for primality.
  - **Returns**: 
    - `bool`: `True` if the number is prime, `False` otherwise.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to check if a number is prime.

'''

def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.
    >>> is_prime(6)
    False
    >>> is_prime(101)
    True
    >>> is_prime(11)
    True
    >>> is_prime(13441)
    True
    >>> is_prime(61)
    True
    >>> is_prime(4)
    False
    >>> is_prime(1)
    False
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```

This implementation uses a common algorithm to check for primality. It first handles small numbers and even numbers, then checks potential factors up to the square root of `n`, skipping even numbers and multiples of 3 for efficiency.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the given task, the code provided does not use any external libraries or packages. It only uses basic Python functionality to determine if a number is prime. Therefore, there are no additional dependencies required for this project. The `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not require any additional Python packages beyond the standard library.

The Programmer is correct in their assessment. The provided code for the `is_prime` function does not utilize any external libraries or packages; it relies solely on Python's built-in functionality. Therefore, there are no additional dependencies required for this project. 

For completeness, if you wish to include a `requirements.txt` file, it would simply indicate that there are no external dependencies. Here is how it would look:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This file serves as a placeholder to show that the project does not require any additional Python packages beyond the standard library. If there are no further questions or tasks, I will consider this matter resolved.

 The Programmer is correct in their assessment. The provided code for the `is_prime` function does not utilize any external libraries or packages; it relies solely on Python's built-in functionality. Therefore, there are no additional dependencies required for this project. 

For completeness, if you wish to include a `requirements.txt` file, it would simply indicate that there are no external dependencies. Here is how it would look:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This file serves as a placeholder to show that the project does not require any additional Python packages beyond the standard library. If there are no further questions or tasks, I will consider this matter resolved.

# Prime Number Checker

This software provides a simple function to determine if a given number is a prime number. It is implemented in Python and does not require any external dependencies.

## Main Function

The main function provided by this software is `is_prime(n)`. This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise.

### Function Definition

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.
    >>> is_prime(6)
    False
    >>> is_prime(101)
    True
    >>> is_prime(11)
    True
    >>> is_prime(13441)
    True
    >>> is_prime(61)
    True
    >>> is_prime(4)
    False
    >>> is_prime(1)
    False
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to use. You only need to have Python installed on your system.

### Python Installation

If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the instructions for your operating system to install Python.

## Usage

To use the `is_prime` function, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Copy the `is_prime` function code into a Python file, for example, `main.py`.
3. Run the Python file using the command line or any Python IDE.

### Example Usage

```python
# Save this code in a file named main.py

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

# Test the function
print(is_prime(6))    # Output: False
print(is_prime(101))  # Output: True
print(is_prime(11))   # Output: True
print(is_prime(13441))# Output: True
print(is_prime(61))   # Output: True
print(is_prime(4))    # Output: False
print(is_prime(1))    # Output: False
```

Run the file using the command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will execute the `is_prime` function with the test cases provided in the code, and you will see the output in the console.
