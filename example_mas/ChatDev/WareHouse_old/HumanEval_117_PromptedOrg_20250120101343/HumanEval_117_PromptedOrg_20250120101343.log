We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To solve the task, we need to implement the `select_words` function in Python. This function will take a string `s` and a natural number `n` as inputs and return a list of words from the string `s` that contain exactly `n` consonants. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we will implement this function:

1. **Split the String**: We will split the input string `s` into individual words.
2. **Identify Consonants**: We will define what constitutes a consonant. In the English alphabet, consonants are all letters except 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (both uppercase and lowercase).
3. **Count Consonants**: For each word, we will count the number of consonants.
4. **Filter Words**: We will collect words that have exactly `n` consonants.
5. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the list of words that meet the criteria.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains the implementation of the select_words function, which filters words from a given string based on the number of consonants they contain.

'''

def select_words(s, n):
    """Given a string s and a natural number n, implement a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
    Examples:
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
    select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []
    select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
    select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]
    """
    # Define vowels
    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
    
    # Split the string into words
    words = s.split()
    
    # Initialize a list to store words with exactly n consonants
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each word
    for word in words:
        # Count consonants in the word
        consonant_count = sum(1 for char in word if char.isalpha() and char not in vowels)
        
        # If the word has exactly n consonants, add it to the result list
        if consonant_count == n:
            result.append(word)
    
    return result
```

This code defines the `select_words` function, which processes the input string to find words with the specified number of consonants and returns them in a list. The function handles edge cases, such as an empty input string, by returning an empty list.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            
def select_words(s, n):
    """Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement 
    a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly 
    n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
    Examples:
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
    select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            
def select_words(s, n):
    """Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement 
    a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly 
    n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
    Examples:
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
    select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []
    select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
    select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]
    """
.
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

According to the new user's task, our designed product modality, languages and ideas, our developed first-edition source codes are listed below:

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

You are the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of ChatDev. Your primary responsibilities include overseeing all technical aspects of the company. You establish the company's technical vision and lead technological development, ensuring that technology resources align with the company's business needs.
You report to the CEO and collaborate with other executives to integrate technology into the company's strategy.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            
def select_words(s, n):
    """Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement 
    a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly 
    n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
    Examples:
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
    select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []
    select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
    select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]
    """
.
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required since the implementation only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, as no additional packages need to be installed for the code to run properly.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

# Select Words by Consonant Count

This software provides a function to filter words from a given string based on the number of consonants they contain. It is designed to help users extract words with a specific number of consonants from any input string.

## Main Functionality

The core function of this software is `select_words(s, n)`, which takes two parameters:
- `s`: A string containing words separated by spaces.
- `n`: A natural number representing the exact number of consonants a word must have to be included in the output list.

### Function Behavior

- The function returns a list of words from the string `s` that contain exactly `n` consonants.
- If the input string `s` is empty, the function returns an empty list.
- The function assumes that the input string contains only letters and spaces.

### Examples

```python
select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4)  # Returns: ["little"]
select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3)  # Returns: ["Mary", "lamb"]
select_words("simple white space", 2)     # Returns: []
select_words("Hello world", 4)            # Returns: ["world"]
select_words("Uncle sam", 3)              # Returns: ["Uncle"]
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies. It is implemented in pure Python and can be used in any Python environment.

### Quick Setup

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone or download the repository containing the `main.py` file.

3. There are no additional packages to install, so you can directly use the function in your Python scripts.

## Usage

To use the `select_words` function, follow these steps:

1. Open your Python environment (e.g., Python shell, Jupyter Notebook, or any Python IDE).

2. Import the function from the `main.py` file:

   ```python
   from main import select_words
   ```

3. Call the `select_words` function with your desired string and consonant count:

   ```python
   result = select_words("Your input string here", 3)
   print(result)
   ```

4. The output will be a list of words from the input string that contain exactly the specified number of consonants.

## Documentation

For further information and examples, please refer to the comments within the `main.py` file. The function is documented with examples to guide you through its usage.

Feel free to modify and adapt the code to fit your specific needs.
