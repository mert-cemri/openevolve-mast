Given the task is to write a piece of software code without any additional interface or presentation requirements, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application" since it involves implementing software or tools using Python. What do you think?

To solve the given task, we need to write a function in Python that adds the even elements located at odd indices in a list. The task specifically asks for a solution without any GUI, so we will focus solely on the logic required to solve the problem.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Function Definition**: We need a function named `add` that takes a list of integers as input.
2. **Iterate Over List**: We will iterate over the list, checking each element's index.
3. **Check Conditions**: For each element, we will check if the index is odd and if the element itself is even.
4. **Sum the Elements**: If both conditions are met, we will add the element to a running total.
5. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the sum of the even elements at odd indices.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

Given a non-empty list of integers lst, add the even elements that are at odd indices.

Examples:
    add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 2 

'''

def add(lst):
    return sum(lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 == 0)

```

This code defines the `add` function, which iterates over the list `lst`, starting from index 1 and stepping by 2 (to access odd indices). It checks if the element at each odd index is even and sums those elements. The result is returned as the output of the function.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Here is a conversation between two roles: Programmer: ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            
def add(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices..

    Examples:
        add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 2 
    """
.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.

Chief Technology Officer: The new user's task and our developed codes are listed:

'''
def add(lst):
    return sum(lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 == 0)
```
"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given task and code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `add` uses only built-in Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
```
This empty file signifies that the project does not require any external Python packages to run. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I agree with the Programmer's assessment. The task involves writing a simple Python function that utilizes only built-in Python capabilities, and thus, does not require any external libraries or packages. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, indicating that no additional dependencies are needed for this project.

# Add Function

This software provides a simple utility function to sum the even integers located at odd indices in a given list. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for quick calculations without any unnecessary overhead.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this software is encapsulated in the `add` function, which performs the following:

- Takes a non-empty list of integers as input.
- Iterates through the list, checking each element at an odd index.
- Sums up the elements that are even and returns this sum.

### Example

```python
result = add([4, 2, 6, 7])
print(result)  # Output: 2
```

In this example, the function checks the elements at indices 1 and 3 (i.e., 2 and 7). Since 2 is even, it is included in the sum, resulting in an output of 2.

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies beyond a standard Python environment. To get started, ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Python Installation**: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Obtain the code by cloning the repository or downloading it as a ZIP file.

3. **Run the Code**: Navigate to the directory containing `main.py` and execute it using Python.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

To use the `add` function, simply import it into your Python script and pass a list of integers as an argument. The function will return the sum of even integers at odd indices.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import add

# Example list
numbers = [4, 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12]

# Calculate the sum of even numbers at odd indices
result = add(numbers)

print(f"The sum of even numbers at odd indices is: {result}")
```

This will output the sum of even numbers located at odd indices in the provided list.

## Documentation

For further information and examples, please refer to the inline comments within the `main.py` file. The code is straightforward and well-documented to facilitate easy understanding and modification.
