To solve the task, we need to implement the `anti_shuffle` function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it. The function should sort the characters of each word in ascending order based on their ASCII values while maintaining the order of words and spaces in the sentence.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Function Name**: `anti_shuffle`
   - **Purpose**: To reorder the characters of each word in a string in ascending order based on ASCII values while maintaining the order of words and spaces.

2. **Steps to Implement**:
   - Split the input string into words and spaces.
   - For each word, sort the characters.
   - Reconstruct the string with sorted words and original spaces.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python

'''

Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
ascending order based on ascii value.
Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

For example:
anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'
anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'
anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'

'''

def anti_shuffle(s):
    # Split the string into words and spaces
    words = s.split(' ')
    
    # Sort each word and keep spaces intact
    sorted_words = [''.join(sorted(word)) for word in words]
    
    # Rejoin the sorted words with spaces
    return ' '.join(sorted_words)

# Example usage
print(anti_shuffle('Hi'))          # Output: 'Hi'
print(anti_shuffle('hello'))       # Output: 'ehllo'
print(anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!'))  # Output: 'Hello !!!Wdlor'

```

This code defines the `anti_shuffle` function, which processes the input string as described, and includes example usage to demonstrate its functionality. The function splits the input string by spaces, sorts each word, and then rejoins them with spaces to produce the desired output.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of ChatDev. Your primary responsibilities include overseeing all technical aspects of the company. You establish the company's technical vision and lead technological development, ensuring that technology resources align with the company's business needs.
You report to the CEO and collaborate with other executives to integrate technology into the company's strategy.

    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:

.
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The function `anti_shuffle` relies solely on Python's built-in functions and data types. Therefore, there are no dependencies to specify in a `requirements.txt` file for this project. 

However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for the sake of completeness or future use, you can create an empty file or include a comment indicating that there are no dependencies. Here is how you can do it:

```plaintext
# requirements.txt

# No external dependencies required for this project.
```

This comment serves as a note to anyone reviewing the project that no additional packages are needed beyond the standard Python library.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

# Anti-Shuffle Function

This software provides a simple Python function, `anti_shuffle`, which takes a string and returns an ordered version of it. The function arranges the characters of each word in ascending order based on their ASCII values while maintaining the order of words and spaces in the sentence.

## Main Functionality

- **anti_shuffle(s):** This function takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string where each word's characters are sorted in ascending order by ASCII value. The order of words and spaces in the original string is preserved.

### Examples

- `anti_shuffle('Hi')` returns `'Hi'`
- `anti_shuffle('hello')` returns `'ehllo'`
- `anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!')` returns `'Hello !!!Wdlor'`

## Installation

No additional dependencies are required to run this software. It is implemented in pure Python. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Python Installation:** Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or Download the Repository:** Obtain the `main.py` file containing the `anti_shuffle` function.

## Usage

1. **Open the Terminal or Command Prompt.**

2. **Navigate to the Directory:** Change to the directory where `main.py` is located.

3. **Run the Script:** Execute the script using Python to see the function in action. You can modify the script to test with different input strings.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Modify the Code:** You can edit `main.py` to test the `anti_shuffle` function with different strings by changing the input to the `print` statements at the bottom of the file.

## Documentation

The `anti_shuffle` function is straightforward and does not require additional libraries or frameworks. It uses Python's built-in string and list manipulation capabilities to achieve the desired functionality.

For further customization or integration into larger projects, you can import the `anti_shuffle` function from `main.py` into your own Python scripts.

## Support

For any issues or questions, please contact our support team or refer to the documentation provided within the code comments.
