Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and testing a piece of Python code, I believe the most suitable product modality would be an "Application." This would allow us to implement the solution as a software tool that can be executed and tested directly. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree. An "Application" is the most appropriate modality for this task, as it involves implementing and testing a Python function. This will allow us to focus on the functionality and ensure the code works as desired.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            
def double_the_difference(lst):
    '''
    Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
    in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.
    
    double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10
    double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
    double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
    double_the_difference([0]) == 0  
   
    If the input list is empty, return 0.

To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

To solve the task, we need to implement the function `double_the_difference` in Python. The function should return the sum of squares of odd numbers from the list, ignoring negative numbers and non-integers. Since the task specifies not to implement a GUI, we will focus only on the function implementation in a single file, `main.py`.

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Definition**: Define the function `double_the_difference(lst)` that takes a list of numbers as input.
2. **Filter Valid Numbers**: Iterate through the list and filter out negative
