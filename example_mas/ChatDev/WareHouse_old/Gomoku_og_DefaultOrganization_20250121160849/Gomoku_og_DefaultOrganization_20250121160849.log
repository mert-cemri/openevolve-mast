To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Develop a standard Gomoku game.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To develop a standard Gomoku game with a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python, we will use the `tkinter` library for the GUI. The game will consist of several components, including the main game logic, the GUI setup, and event handling. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the core classes and functions needed for the Gomoku game:

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **GomokuGame**: This class will handle the game logic, including initializing the board, checking for a win, and managing player turns.
   - `__init__(self)`: Initialize the game board and set the starting player.
   - `reset_game(self)`: Reset the game to its initial state.
   - `make_move(self, x, y)`: Place a piece on the board and switch turns.
   - `check_winner(self, x, y)`: Check if the current move results in a win.

2. **GomokuGUI**: This class will manage the graphical user interface using `tkinter`.
   - `__init__(self, master)`: Initialize the GUI components.
   - `draw_board(self)`: Draw the game board on the GUI.
   - `handle_click(self, event)`: Handle mouse click events to make moves.
   - `update_status(self)`: Update the game status display.

3. **main()**: The main function to start the application.

### File Structure

1. `gomoku.py`: Contains the `GomokuGame` class.
2. `gui.py`: Contains the `GomokuGUI` class.
3. `main.py`: The entry point of the application.

Let's implement each file:

The code is mostly well-structured and follows the requirements. However, there is a minor issue with the `draw_board` method in `GomokuGUI` class. The lines are drawn slightly off the intended grid, which can cause misalignment when placing pieces. The grid lines should start and end at the correct positions to ensure proper alignment with the pieces.

### Comment with Highest Priority:
The grid lines in the `draw_board` method are not aligned correctly with the intended positions for placing pieces, which can cause visual misalignment.

### Suggestion for Revision:
Adjust the starting and ending points of the grid lines in the `draw_board` method to ensure they align perfectly with the positions where pieces are placed. The lines should start and end at the exact positions that correspond to the centers of the squares on the board.

### Code Revision:
```python
def draw_board(self):
    self.canvas.delete("all")
    for i in range(self.game.size):
        self.canvas.create_line(40, 40 + i * 40, 40 + (self.game.size - 1) * 40, 40 + i * 40)
        self.canvas.create_line(40 + i * 40, 40, 40 + i * 40, 40 + (self.game.size - 1) * 40)
```

This adjustment ensures that the grid lines are drawn correctly, aligning with the centers of the squares where the pieces are placed.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is mostly well-structured and follows the requirements. However, there is a minor issue with the `draw_board` method in `GomokuGUI` class. The lines are drawn slightly off the intended grid, which can cause misalignment when placing pieces. The grid lines should start and end at the correct positions to ensure proper alignment with the pieces.

### Comment with Highest Priority:
The grid lines in the `draw_board` method are not aligned correctly with the intended positions for placing pieces, which can cause visual misalignment.

### Suggestion for Revision:
Adjust the starting and ending points of the grid lines in the `draw_board` method to ensure they align perfectly with the positions where pieces are placed. The lines should start and end at the exact positions that correspond to the centers of the squares on the board.

### Code Revision:
```python
def draw_board(self):
    self.canvas.delete("all")
    for i in range(self.game.size):
        self.canvas.create_line(40, 40 + i * 40, 40 + (self.game.size - 1) * 40, 40 + i * 40)
        self.canvas.create_line(40 + i * 40, 40, 40 + i * 40, 40 + (self.game.size - 1) * 40)
```

This adjustment ensures that the grid lines are drawn correctly, aligning with the centers of the squares where the pieces are placed."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a standard Gomoku game..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and functional. However, there is a potential issue with the user interface interaction and feedback. Specifically, when a player wins, the game does not automatically reset or provide an option to start a new game. This could lead to confusion for users who may not realize the game has ended and may continue to make moves on the board.

### Comment with Highest Priority:
The game should provide a clear indication that the game has ended and offer an option to reset or start a new game after a player wins.

### Suggested Revision:
1. Modify the `handle_click` method in `GomokuGUI` to include a prompt for starting a new game when a win is detected.
2. Implement a method to reset the game board and update the UI accordingly.

Here is how you can implement these changes:

```python
def handle_click(self, event):
    x, y = (event.x - 20) // 40, (event.y - 20) // 40
    if 0 <= x < self.game.size and 0 <= y < self.game.size:
        result = self.game.make_move(x, y)
        if result:
            self.status_label.config(text=result)
            self.prompt_new_game()
        else:
            self.update_status()
        self.draw_board()
        self.draw_pieces()

def prompt_new_game(self):
    response = tk.messagebox.askyesno("Game Over", "Do you want to start a new game?")
    if response:
        self.game.reset_game()
        self.update_status()
        self.draw_board()
        self.draw_pieces()
```

Make sure to import `messagebox` from `tkinter` at the beginning of `gui.py`:

```python
import tkinter.messagebox
```

This change will enhance the user experience by clearly indicating the end of a game and providing an easy way to start a new one.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is mostly well-structured and functional. However, there is a potential issue with the user interface interaction and feedback. Specifically, when a player wins, the game does not automatically reset or provide an option to start a new game. This could lead to confusion for users who may not realize the game has ended and may continue to make moves on the board.

### Comment with Highest Priority:
The game should provide a clear indication that the game has ended and offer an option to reset or start a new game after a player wins.

### Suggested Revision:
1. Modify the `handle_click` method in `GomokuGUI` to include a prompt for starting a new game when a win is detected.
2. Implement a method to reset the game board and update the UI accordingly.

Here is how you can implement these changes:

```python
def handle_click(self, event):
    x, y = (event.x - 20) // 40, (event.y - 20) // 40
    if 0 <= x < self.game.size and 0 <= y < self.game.size:
        result = self.game.make_move(x, y)
        if result:
            self.status_label.config(text=result)
            self.prompt_new_game()
        else:
            self.update_status()
        self.draw_board()
        self.draw_pieces()

def prompt_new_game(self):
    response = tk.messagebox.askyesno("Game Over", "Do you want to start a new game?")
    if response:
        self.game.reset_game()
        self.update_status()
        self.draw_board()
        self.draw_pieces()
```

Make sure to import `messagebox` from `tkinter` at the beginning of `gui.py`:

```python
import tkinter.messagebox
```

This change will enhance the user experience by clearly indicating the end of a game and providing an easy way to start a new one."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Modify the handle_click method in GomokuGUI to include a prompt for starting a new game when a win is detected.\n2. Implement a method to reset the game board and update the UI accordingly.\n\nHere is how you can implement these changes:\n\npython\ndef handle_click(self, event):\n    x, y = (event.x - 20) // 40, (event.y - 20) // 40\n    if 0 &lt;= x &lt; self.game.size and 0 &lt;= y &lt; self.game.size:\n        result = self.game.make_move(x, y)\n        if result:\n            self.status_label.config(text=result)\n            self.prompt_new_game()\n        else:\n            self.update_status()\n        self.draw_board()\n        self.draw_pieces()\n\ndef prompt_new_game(self):\n    response = tk.messagebox.askyesno("Game Over", "Do you want to start a new game?")\n    if response:\n        self.game.reset_game()\n        self.update_status()\n        self.draw_board()\n        self.draw_pieces()\n\n\nMake sure to import messagebox from tkinter at the beginning of gui.py:\n\npython\nimport tkinter.messagebox\n\n\nThis change will enhance the user experience by clearly indicating the end of a game and providing an easy way to start a new one.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a standard Gomoku game..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code is mostly well-structured and functional, but there is a potential issue with the `make_move` method in the `GomokuGame` class. The method does not handle the case where the coordinates `(x, y)` are out of bounds, which could lead to an IndexError if a user clicks outside the board area. This is a critical issue as it can cause the application to crash.

To fix this, you should add a boundary check at the beginning of the `make_move` method to ensure that the coordinates are within the valid range of the board.

Here is the suggested revision for the `make_move` method:

```python
def make_move(self, x, y):
    if not (0 <= x < self.size and 0 <= y < self.size):
        return "Invalid move!"
    if self.board[x][y] is None:
        self.board[x][y] = self.current_player
        if self.check_winner(x, y):
            return f"{self.current_player} wins!"
        self.current_player = 'White' if self.current_player == 'Black' else 'Black'
        return None
    else:
        return "Invalid move!"
```

This addition ensures that any move outside the board boundaries is immediately flagged as invalid, preventing potential errors.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is mostly well-structured and functional, but there is a potential issue with the `make_move` method in the `GomokuGame` class. The method does not handle the case where the coordinates `(x, y)` are out of bounds, which could lead to an IndexError if a user clicks outside the board area. This is a critical issue as it can cause the application to crash.

To fix this, you should add a boundary check at the beginning of the `make_move` method to ensure that the coordinates are within the valid range of the board.

Here is the suggested revision for the `make_move` method:

```python
def make_move(self, x, y):
    if not (0 <= x < self.size and 0 <= y < self.size):
        return "Invalid move!"
    if self.board[x][y] is None:
        self.board[x][y] = self.current_player
        if self.check_winner(x, y):
            return f"{self.current_player} wins!"
        self.current_player = 'White' if self.current_player == 'Black' else 'Black'
        return None
    else:
        return "Invalid move!"
```

This addition ensures that any move outside the board boundaries is immediately flagged as invalid, preventing potential errors."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a standard Gomoku game..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error message you encountered is related to the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces in Python. The specific error, `_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable`, indicates that the Tkinter application is trying to open a GUI window, but it cannot find a display to render the window on. This typically happens when you try to run a Tkinter application on a system without a graphical display environment, such as a remote server or a headless machine.

Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Environment Issue**: The error suggests that the environment where the code is being executed does not have access to a graphical display. This is common in environments like remote servers or virtual machines that do not have a GUI.

2. **$DISPLAY Variable**: In Unix-like systems, the `$DISPLAY` environment variable specifies the display server to use for rendering GUI applications. If this variable is not set, Tkinter cannot find a display to use.

3. **Potential Solutions**:
   - **Run Locally**: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical interface.
   - **Use X11 Forwarding**: If running on a remote server, use X11 forwarding to redirect the display to your local machine. This can be done by connecting to the server using SSH with the `-X` option (e.g., `ssh -X user@server`).
   - **Virtual Display**: Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to simulate a display environment on the server.

By addressing the environment issue, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the display error.

Error Summary of Test Reports:
"The error message you encountered is related to the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces in Python. The specific error, `_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable`, indicates that the Tkinter application is trying to open a GUI window, but it cannot find a display to render the window on. This typically happens when you try to run a Tkinter application on a system without a graphical display environment, such as a remote server or a headless machine.

Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Environment Issue**: The error suggests that the environment where the code is being executed does not have access to a graphical display. This is common in environments like remote servers or virtual machines that do not have a GUI.

2. **$DISPLAY Variable**: In Unix-like systems, the `$DISPLAY` environment variable specifies the display server to use for rendering GUI applications. If this variable is not set, Tkinter cannot find a display to use.

3. **Potential Solutions**:
   - **Run Locally**: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical interface.
   - **Use X11 Forwarding**: If running on a remote server, use X11 forwarding to redirect the display to your local machine. This can be done by connecting to the server using SSH with the `-X` option (e.g., `ssh -X user@server`).
   - **Virtual Display**: Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to simulate a display environment on the server.

By addressing the environment issue, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the display error."
Note that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary. Now, use the format exemplified above and modify the problematic codes based on the error summary. Output the codes that you fixed based on the test reported and corresponding explanations (strictly follow the format defined above, including FILENAME, LANGUAGE, DOCSTRING and CODE; incomplete "TODO" codes are strictly prohibited). If no bugs are reported, please return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

This typically happens when you try to run a Tkinter application on a system without a graphical display environment, such as a remote server or a headless machine.\n\nHere are the key points to consider:\n\n1. Environment Issue: The error suggests that the environment where the code is being executed does not have access to a graphical display. This is common in environments like remote servers or virtual machines that do not have a GUI.\n\n2. $DISPLAY Variable: In Unix-like systems, the $DISPLAY environment variable specifies the display server to use for rendering GUI applications. If this variable is not set, Tkinter cannot find a display to use.\n\n3. Potential Solutions:\n   - Run Locally: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical interface.\n   - Use X11 Forwarding: If running on a remote server, use X11 forwarding to redirect the display to your local machine. This can be done by connecting to the server using SSH with the -X option (e.g., ssh -X user@server).\n   - Virtual Display: Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to simulate a display environment on the server.\n\nBy addressing the environment issue, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the display error.'} |

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error message you encountered is a common issue when trying to run a Tkinter-based GUI application in an environment that does not have access to a display server, such as a headless server or a remote terminal without X11 forwarding. The specific error message is:

```
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error indicates that the Tkinter library is unable to find a display to render the GUI. Here are the key points and potential solutions:

1. **Environment Issue**: The error is not related to the code itself but rather the environment where the code is being executed. Tkinter requires a graphical environment to display the GUI, and it relies on the `$DISPLAY` environment variable to know where to render the windows.

2. **Possible Solutions**:
   - **Run Locally**: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical interface.
   - **Use X11 Forwarding**: If you are accessing a remote server, ensure that X11 forwarding is enabled. This can be done by using the `-X` option with SSH (e.g., `ssh -X user@remote-server`).
   - **Virtual Display**: Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to create a virtual display environment. This is useful for running GUI applications in headless environments.
   - **Check DISPLAY Variable**: Ensure that the `$DISPLAY` environment variable is set correctly. You can check this by running `echo $DISPLAY` in the terminal.

By addressing the environment issue, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the `_tkinter.TclError`.

Error Summary of Test Reports:
"The error message you encountered is a common issue when trying to run a Tkinter-based GUI application in an environment that does not have access to a display server, such as a headless server or a remote terminal without X11 forwarding. The specific error message is:

```
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error indicates that the Tkinter library is unable to find a display to render the GUI. Here are the key points and potential solutions:

1. **Environment Issue**: The error is not related to the code itself but rather the environment where the code is being executed. Tkinter requires a graphical environment to display the GUI, and it relies on the `$DISPLAY` environment variable to know where to render the windows.

2. **Possible Solutions**:
   - **Run Locally**: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical interface.
   - **Use X11 Forwarding**: If you are accessing a remote server, ensure that X11 forwarding is enabled. This can be done by using the `-X` option with SSH (e.g., `ssh -X user@remote-server`).
   - **Virtual Display**: Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to create a virtual display environment. This is useful for running GUI applications in headless environments.
   - **Check DISPLAY Variable**: Ensure that the `$DISPLAY` environment variable is set correctly. You can check this by running `echo $DISPLAY` in the terminal.

By addressing the environment issue, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the `_tkinter.TclError`."
Note that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary. Now, use the format exemplified above and modify the problematic codes based on the error summary. Output the codes that you fixed based on the test reported and corresponding explanations (strictly follow the format defined above, including FILENAME, LANGUAGE, DOCSTRING and CODE; incomplete "TODO" codes are strictly prohibited). If no bugs are reported, please return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Tkinter requires a graphical environment to display the GUI, and it relies on the $DISPLAY environment variable to know where to render the windows.\n\n2. Possible Solutions:\n   - Run Locally: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical interface.\n   - Use X11 Forwarding: If you are accessing a remote server, ensure that X11 forwarding is enabled. This can be done by using the -X option with SSH (e.g., ssh -X user@remote-server).\n   - Virtual Display: Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to create a virtual display environment. This is useful for running GUI applications in headless environments.\n   - Check DISPLAY Variable: Ensure that the $DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly. You can check this by running echo $DISPLAY in the terminal.\n\nBy addressing the environment issue, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the _tkinter.TclError.'} |

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error message you encountered is a common issue when trying to run a Tkinter-based GUI application in an environment that does not have access to a display server, such as a headless server or a virtual environment without GUI support. The specific error is:

```
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error indicates that the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces, is unable to find a display to render the GUI. This typically happens when:

1. **Running in a Headless Environment**: The environment where the code is being executed does not have a graphical display available. This is common in remote servers or CI/CD pipelines.

2. **Missing or Incorrect DISPLAY Variable**: The `$DISPLAY` environment variable is not set or is incorrectly configured. This variable tells GUI applications where to render their windows.

To resolve this issue, you can consider the following approaches:

1. **Run on a Local Machine**: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical display.

2. **Use a Virtual Display**: If you need to run the application in a headless environment, you can use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to simulate a display. You can start Xvfb before running your application and set the `$DISPLAY` variable to point to the virtual display.

3. **Check DISPLAY Variable**: Ensure that the `$DISPLAY` environment variable is correctly set if you are running the application in an environment that should have a display.

By addressing the display issue, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the `_tkinter.TclError`.

Error Summary of Test Reports:
"The error message you encountered is a common issue when trying to run a Tkinter-based GUI application in an environment that does not have access to a display server, such as a headless server or a virtual environment without GUI support. The specific error is:

```
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error indicates that the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces, is unable to find a display to render the GUI. This typically happens when:

1. **Running in a Headless Environment**: The environment where the code is being executed does not have a graphical display available. This is common in remote servers or CI/CD pipelines.

2. **Missing or Incorrect DISPLAY Variable**: The `$DISPLAY` environment variable is not set or is incorrectly configured. This variable tells GUI applications where to render their windows.

To resolve this issue, you can consider the following approaches:

1. **Run on a Local Machine**: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical display.

2. **Use a Virtual Display**: If you need to run the application in a headless environment, you can use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to simulate a display. You can start Xvfb before running your application and set the `$DISPLAY` variable to point to the virtual display.

3. **Check DISPLAY Variable**: Ensure that the `$DISPLAY` environment variable is correctly set if you are running the application in an environment that should have a display.

By addressing the display issue, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the `_tkinter.TclError`."
Note that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary. Now, use the format exemplified above and modify the problematic codes based on the error summary. Output the codes that you fixed based on the test reported and corresponding explanations (strictly follow the format defined above, including FILENAME, LANGUAGE, DOCSTRING and CODE; incomplete "TODO" codes are strictly prohibited). If no bugs are reported, please return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Based on the provided code, the Gomoku application primarily uses the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface. However, `tkinter` is a standard library in Python and does not need to be included in the `requirements.txt` file. Since no other external libraries are used in the code, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty. However, if you plan to add any additional features that require external libraries, you would list them here.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

If you decide to add any additional libraries in the future, you can update this file accordingly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, the Gomoku application primarily uses the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface. However, `tkinter` is a standard library in Python and does not need to be included in the `requirements.txt` file. Since no other external libraries are used in the code, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty. However, if you plan to add any additional features that require external libraries, you would list them here.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```
If you decide to add any additional libraries in the future, you can update this file accordingly. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I agree with the Programmer's assessment. The provided code for the Gomoku game uses only the `tkinter` library, which is part of Python's standard library and does not require listing in the `requirements.txt` file. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty for now. However, it is important to note that if any additional features or external libraries are added in the future, this file should be updated accordingly to ensure all dependencies are documented.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

Please ensure that any future modifications or enhancements to the project that involve external libraries are reflected in this file to maintain proper dependency management.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Gomoku Game

Welcome to the Gomoku Game! This application allows you to play the classic board game Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, against another player. The game is implemented in Python and features a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.

## Main Functions

- **Game Logic**: The core logic of the Gomoku game is implemented in `gomoku.py`. It handles the game board, player turns, and win condition checks.
- **Graphical User Interface**: The GUI is implemented in `gui.py` using Tkinter. It provides a visual representation of the board and allows players to interact with the game using mouse clicks.
- **Game Management**: The application manages game states, including starting a new game and displaying the current player's turn.

## Installation

### Environment Setup

This project does not require any external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the project files to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Game**: Execute the main script to start the game.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run `main.py` to launch the game window.
2. **Game Interface**: The game board will be displayed in a window. The board consists of a 15x15 grid, which is the standard size for Gomoku.
3. **Making a Move**: Click on an empty intersection on the board to place your piece. The game alternates turns between two players: Black and White.
4. **Winning the Game**: The objective is to be the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
5. **Game Over**: When a player wins, a message will be displayed. You can choose to start a new game by responding to the prompt.

## Additional Information

- **Current Player Indicator**: The current player is displayed at the top of the game window.
- **New Game Prompt**: After a game ends, you will be prompted to start a new game. Click 'Yes' to reset the board and begin again.

Enjoy playing Gomoku and challenge your friends to see who can master the board!
