To solve the task, we need to implement the `strange_sort_list` function in Python. This function will take a list of integers and return a new list sorted in a "strange" order, where we alternate between the smallest and largest remaining elements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Function Name**: `strange_sort_list`
   - **Purpose**: To sort a list of integers in a "strange" order by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize an empty list to store the result.
   - While the input list is not empty:
     - Find the minimum value in the list, remove it, and append it to the result.
     - If the list is still not empty, find the maximum value, remove it, and append it to the result.
   - Return the result list.

Now, let's implement this in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python

'''

Given list of integers, return list in strange order.
Strange sorting, is when you start with the minimum value,
then maximum of the remaining integers, then minimum and so on.

Examples:
strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 4, 2, 3]
strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5, 5, 5, 5]
strange_sort_list([]) == []

'''

def strange_sort_list(lst):
    result = []
    while lst:
        min_val = min(lst)
        result.append(min_val)
        lst.remove(min_val)
        if lst:
            max_val = max(lst)
            result.append(max_val)
            lst.remove(max_val)
    return result

```

This code implements the `strange_sort_list` function as described. It iteratively finds and removes the minimum and maximum values from the list, appending them to the result list, until the input list is empty.

def strange_sort_list(lst):
    result = []
    while lst:
        min_val = min(lst)
        result.append(min_val)
        lst.remove(min_val)
        if lst:

            result.append(max_val)

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2

```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `strange_sort_list` only uses built-in Python functions and data structures. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed for this project.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

The programmer's response is correct. The `strange_sort_list` function only uses built-in Python functions and data structures, so there are no external dependencies required for this project. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed. Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This file serves as documentation that the project does not rely on any third-party libraries, ensuring clarity for anyone reviewing or using the project in the future.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

# Strange Sort List

This software provides a function to sort a list of integers in a "strange" order. The strange sorting algorithm starts with the minimum value, then the maximum of the remaining integers, then the next minimum, and so on.

## Main Function

### `strange_sort_list(lst)`

- **Description**: 
  - This function takes a list of integers and returns a new list sorted in a strange order. The strange order is defined as starting with the minimum value, then the maximum of the remaining integers, then the next minimum, and so on.
  
- **Parameters**: 
  - `lst` (list): A list of integers to be sorted.

- **Returns**: 
  - A list of integers sorted in the strange order.

- **Examples**:
  - `strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4])` returns `[1, 4, 2, 3]`
  - `strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5])` returns `[5, 5, 5, 5]`
  - `strange_sort_list([])` returns `[]`

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies. It is implemented in Python and can be used directly in any Python environment.

### Quick Install

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file to your local machine.

3. No additional installation steps are required since there are no external dependencies.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

3. Run the Python interpreter and import the function:

   ```bash
   python
   ```

   ```python
   from main import strange_sort_list
   ```

4. Use the function by passing a list of integers:

   ```python
   result = strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4])
   print(result)  # Output: [1, 4, 2, 3]
   ```

5. You can test the function with different lists to see the strange sorting in action.

## Documentation

For further information and examples, please refer to the comments within the `main.py` file. The function is straightforward and designed to be easily integrated into larger projects if needed.

Feel free to modify and adapt the code to suit your specific needs. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please reach out for support.
