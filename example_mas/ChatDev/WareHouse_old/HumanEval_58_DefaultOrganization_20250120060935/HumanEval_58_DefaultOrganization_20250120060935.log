Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and fixing a piece of software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a functional piece of code, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To complete the task, we need to implement the function `common` that returns sorted unique common elements from two lists. Since the task specifies not to implement a GUI and only requires the necessary code to solve the problem, we will focus on implementing the function in a single Python file named `main.py`.

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Name**: `common`
   - **Purpose**: To find and return a sorted list of unique common elements from two input lists.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - Convert both lists to sets to eliminate duplicates and find the intersection.
   - Convert the intersection back to a list and sort it.
   - Return the sorted list.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

DOCSTRING

'''

def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.
    >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
    [1, 5, 653]
    >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
    [2, 3]
    """
    # Convert lists to sets to find common elements
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)
    
    # Find intersection of sets
    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)
    
    # Convert to sorted list
    return sorted(common_elements)
```

This code will correctly find the unique common elements between two lists, sort them, and return the result. The function is tested with the provided examples in the docstring.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code only uses built-in Python functionalities such as lists, sets, and sorting, which do not require any additional packages. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required

# Common Elements Finder

This software provides a simple utility function to find and return sorted unique common elements from two lists. It is implemented in Python and does not require any external dependencies.

## Main Functionality

The main function of this software is:

- **common(l1: list, l2: list):** This function takes two lists as input and returns a sorted list of unique elements that are common to both lists.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example 1
result = common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
print(result)  # Output: [1, 5, 653]

# Example 2
result = common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
print(result)  # Output: [2, 3]
```

## Installation

### Environment Setup

Since this software does not require any external libraries, setting up the environment is straightforward. You only need to have Python installed on your system.

1. **Install Python:**
   - Download and install Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Verify Python Installation:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to verify the installation:
     ```
     python --version
     ```
   - You should see the Python version number if the installation was successful.
