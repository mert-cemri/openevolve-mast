Given the task is to write a piece of software code to change the numerical base of a number, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task involves implementing a software tool that performs a specific function, which aligns with the characteristics of an application. What are your thoughts on this?

To solve the task, we need to implement the `change_base` function in Python. This function will convert a given integer `x` from base 10 to another specified base `base`, which is less than 10. The function will return the string representation of the number in the new base.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Name**: `change_base`
   - **Purpose**: Convert a decimal number to a specified base and return the result as a string.
   
2. **Parameters**:
   - `x` (int): The number in base 10 to be converted.
   - `base` (int): The base to convert the number to. Must be less than 10.

3. **Return Value**:
   - A string representing the number in the new base.

4. **Logic**:
   - Use a loop to repeatedly divide the number by the base and collect remainders.
   - Append each remainder to a list.
   - Reverse the list of remainders to get the correct order.
   - Convert the list to a string and return it.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python

'''

Change numerical base of input number x to base.
Return string representation after the conversion.
Base numbers are less than 10.

'''

def change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str:
    if base < 2 or base > 9:
        raise ValueError("Base must be between 2 and 9, inclusive.")
    
    if x == 0:
        return "0"
    
    digits = []
    while x > 0:
        remainder = x % base
        digits.append(str(remainder))
        x = x // base
    
    # Reverse the digits to get the correct order
    digits.reverse()
    
    # Join the list into a string
    return ''.join(digits)

# Example usage:
# print(change_base(8, 3))  # Output: '22'
# print(change_base(8, 2))  # Output: '1000'
# print(change_base(7, 2))  # Output: '111'

```

This code implements the `change_base` function as described, ensuring it meets the requirements and passes the provided examples.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The function `change_base` is implemented using only Python's built-in functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, as there are no additional dependencies required for this project.
Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:
```

# Change Base User Manual

Welcome to the Change Base software! This tool allows you to convert a given integer from base 10 to another numerical base, with the base numbers being less than 10. This manual will guide you through the installation, usage, and main functions of the software.

## Quick Install

This software does not require any external dependencies. You only need Python installed on your system to run the code.

### Step 1: Install Python

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Clone or Download the Repository

You can clone the repository using Git or download the ZIP file from the repository page.

To clone the repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory

Once you have the files, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd <project-directory>
```

Replace `<project-directory>` with the actual directory name.

## 🤔 What is this?

The Change Base software is a simple Python script that converts a given integer from base 10 to another specified base. The base must be between 2 and 9, inclusive. This tool is useful for educational purposes, software development, and understanding numerical base conversions.

## Main Function

The main function of this software is `change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str`. It takes two parameters:

- `x`: The integer you want to convert.
- `base`: The base to which you want to convert the integer. The base must be between 2 and 9.

### Example Usage

Here are some examples of how to use the `change_base` function:

```python
print(change_base(8, 3))  # Output: '22'
print(change_base(8, 2))  # Output: '1000'
print(change_base(7, 2))  # Output: '111'
```

## How to Use

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.
3. Run the Python script using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

4. You can modify the `main.py` file to include your own test cases or use the function in your own Python scripts.

## 📖 Documentation

For further information or assistance, please refer to the comments within the `main.py` file. The code is documented to help you understand the logic and flow of the conversion process.

 # Change Base User Manual

Welcome to the Change Base software! This tool allows you to convert a given integer from base 10 to another numerical base, with the base numbers being less than 10. This manual will guide you through the installation, usage, and main functions of the software.

## Quick Install

This software does not require any external dependencies. You only need Python installed on your system to run the code.

### Step 1: Install Python

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Clone or Download the Repository

You can clone the repository using Git or download the ZIP file from the repository page.

```bash
cd <project-directory>
```

Replace `<project-directory>` with the actual directory name.

## 🤔 What is this?

The Change Base software is a simple Python script that converts a given integer from base 10 to another specified base. The base must be between 2 and 9, inclusive. This tool is useful for educational purposes, software development, and understanding numerical base conversions.

## Main Function

The main function of this software is `change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str`. It takes two parameters:

- `x`: The integer you want to convert.
- `base`: The base to which you want to convert the integer. The base must be between 2 and 9.

### Example Usage

Here are some examples of how to use the `change_base` function:

```python
print(change_base(8, 3))  # Output: '22'
print(change_base(8, 2))  # Output: '1000'
print(change_base(7, 2))  # Output: '111'
```

## How to Use

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.
3. Run the Python script using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

4. You can modify the `main.py` file to include your own test cases or use the function in your own Python scripts.

## 📖 Documentation

For further information or assistance, please refer to the comments within the `main.py` file. The code is documented to help you understand the logic and flow of the conversion process.
