To solve the task, we need to implement the function `count_up_to(n)` that returns a list of prime numbers less than `n`. Here's the plan:

1. **Function: `is_prime(num)`**
   - Purpose: Check if a number is prime.
   - Input: An integer `num`.
   - Output: Boolean `True` if `num` is prime, `False` otherwise.

2. **Function: `count_up_to(n)`**
   - Purpose: Generate a list of prime numbers less than `n`.
   - Input: A non-negative integer `n`.
   - Output: A list of prime numbers less than `n`.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python

'''

def is_prime(num):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:

    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:

    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:

        i += 6
    return True

def count_up_to(n):

    for num in range(2, n):

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses standard Python functions and libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that there are no additional packages needed beyond the standard Python library.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses standard Python functions and libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that there are no additional packages needed beyond the standard Python library. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Prime Number Finder

This software provides functionality to find prime numbers less than a given number. It includes a module with functions to determine if a number is prime and to generate a list of prime numbers up to a specified limit.

## Main Functions

### 1. `is_prime(num)`

- **Description**: Checks if a given number is a prime number.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `num` (int): The number to check for primality.
- **Returns**: 
  - `bool`: `True` if the number is prime, `False` otherwise.

### 2. `count_up_to(n)`

- **Description**: Returns a list of prime numbers less than a specified number.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `n` (int): The upper limit (exclusive) for finding prime numbers.
- **Returns**: 
  - `list`: A list of prime numbers less than `n`.

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it simple to set up and use. You only need Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the prime number functions.

2. **Run the Code**: Use a Python interpreter to run the `main.py` file. You can test the functions by calling them with different arguments.

   Example usage:

   ```python
   from main import count_up_to

   # Find prime numbers less than 11
   primes = count_up_to(11)
   print(primes)  # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7]
   ```
