We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To solve the task, we need to implement the `is_sorted` function in Python. The function will check if a list of numbers is sorted in ascending order and ensure that no number appears more than twice consecutively. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

1. **Function Name**: `is_sorted`
   - **Purpose**: To determine if a list of integers is sorted in ascending order and contains no more than one duplicate of any number.

2. **Logic**:
   - Iterate through the list and check if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
   - Count occurrences of each number and ensure no number appears more than twice consecutively.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

            return False
    
    count = {}

        else:

Comments on Codes:
"The code has a logical error in the condition for checking duplicates. The current implementation checks if any number appears more than twice, but the requirement is to return False if any number appears more than once. The condition should be `if count[num] > 1` instead of `if count[num] > 2`.

To fix this, modify the condition in the loop that checks for duplicates:

    in ascending order. If list has more than 1 duplicate of the same

In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The code has a logical error in the condition that checks for duplicates. The requirement is to return `False` if there is more than one duplicate of the same number, meaning a number should not appear more than twice. However, the current code returns `False` if a number appears more than once. 

To fix this, update the condition to allow a number to appear up to twice:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return True
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        if lst[i] < lst[i - 1]:
            return False
    count = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in count:
            count[num] += 1
            if count[num] > 2:  # Allow up to two occurrences
                return False
        else:
            count[num] = 1
    return True
```

This change ensures that the function correctly returns `False` only if a number appears more than twice in the list.

Comments on Codes:
"The code has a logical error in the condition that checks for duplicates. The requirement is to return `False` if there is more than one duplicate of the same number, meaning a number should not appear more than twice. However, the current code returns `False` if a number appears more than once. 

To fix this, update the condition to allow a number to appear up to twice:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return True
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        if lst[i] < lst[i - 1]:
            return False
    count = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in count:
            count[num] += 1
            if count[num] > 2:  # Allow up to two occurrences
                return False
        else:
            count[num] = 1
    return True
```

This change ensures that the function correctly returns `False` only if a number appears more than twice in the list."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The code has a logical error in the condition for checking duplicates. The current implementation allows up to two occurrences of the same number, but the requirement is to return False if there is more than one duplicate (i.e., more than two occurrences) of the same number. The condition should be `if count[num] > 1:` instead of `if count[num] > 2:`.

To fix this, update the condition in the code:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return True
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        if lst[i] < lst[i - 1]:
            return False
    count = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in count:
            count[num] += 1
            if count[num] > 1:  # Allow only up to one duplicate
                return False
        else:
            count[num] = 1
    return True
```

This change ensures that the function correctly returns False if there is more than one duplicate of the same number in the list.

Comments on Codes:
"The code has a logical error in the condition for checking duplicates. The current implementation allows up to two occurrences of the same number, but the requirement is to return False if there is more than one duplicate (i.e., more than two occurrences) of the same number. The condition should be `if count[num] > 1:` instead of `if count[num] > 2:`.

To fix this, update the condition in the code:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return True
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        if lst[i] < lst[i - 1]:
            return False
    count = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in count:
            count[num] += 1
            if count[num] > 1:  # Allow only up to one duplicate
                return False
        else:
            count[num] = 1
    return True
```

This change ensures that the function correctly returns False if there is more than one duplicate of the same number in the list."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the given code, there are no external dependencies or packages required since it only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you want to include a placeholder for future dependencies, you can create an empty `requirements.txt` file or add a comment indicating no dependencies are needed.

Here's how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

```

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code, there are no external dependencies or packages required since it only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you want to include a placeholder for future dependencies, you can create an empty `requirements.txt` file or add a comment indicating no dependencies are needed.
Here's how the `requirements.txt` file would look:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the CEO, I confirm that the Programmer's assessment is correct. The provided code for the `is_sorted` function does not require any external libraries or packages, as it utilizes only basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty or contain a comment indicating that no external dependencies are needed. Here is the appropriate content for the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

This ensures clarity and maintains a standard practice for documenting dependencies, even when none are necessary. If there are any future updates or additional features that require external packages, the `requirements.txt` file can be updated accordingly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

# is_sorted Function User Manual

## Introduction

The `is_sorted` function is a Python utility designed to determine if a list of integers is sorted in ascending order. Additionally, it checks for duplicates, ensuring that no number appears more than once in the list. This function is particularly useful for validating data sequences where order and uniqueness are important.

## Main Functionality

- **is_sorted(lst):** This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value:
  - `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order and contains no more than one duplicate of any number.
  - `False` if the list is not sorted or contains more than one duplicate of any number.

### Examples

- `is_sorted([5])` ➞ `True`
- `is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` ➞ `True`
- `is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5])` ➞ `False`
- `is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4])` ➞ `True`
- `is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4])` ➞ `False`

## Installation

### Environment Setup

This project does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to set up. You only need Python installed on your system.

1. **Ensure Python is installed:**
   - You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
