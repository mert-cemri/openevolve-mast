We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

.
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To solve the task, we need to implement the `is_sorted` function in Python. The function should check if a list of integers is sorted in ascending order and ensure that no number appears more than twice consecutively. Here's the plan:

1. **Function Name**: `is_sorted`
   - **Purpose**: To determine if a list of integers is sorted in ascending order and does not contain any number more than twice consecutively.

2. **Steps**:
   - Iterate through the list and check if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
   - Count consecutive duplicates and ensure no number appears more than twice consecutively.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''
Given a list of numbers, return whether or not they are sorted
in ascending order. If list has more than 1 duplicate of the same
number, return False. Assume no negative numbers and only integers.

is_sorted([5]) ➞ True

is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5]) ➞ False
is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) ➞ True
is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) ➞ True
is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]) ➞ False
is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]) ➞ True
is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]) ➞ False
'''

def is_sorted(lst):
    if not lst:
        return True
    
    consecutive_count = 1
    
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        if lst[i] < lst[i - 1]:
            return False
        if lst[i] == lst[i - 1]:
            consecutive_count += 1
            if consecutive_count > 2:
                return False
        else:
            consecutive_count = 1
    
    return True
```

This code defines the `is_sorted` function, which checks if the list is sorted in ascending order and ensures that no number appears more than twice consecutively. The function iterates through the list, comparing each element with the previous one to ensure the order and count of duplicates.

This code defines the `is_sorted` function, which checks if the list is sorted in ascending order and ensures that no number appears more than twice consecutively. The function iterates through the list, comparing each element with the previous one to ensure the order and count of duplicates.

The code has a logical error in handling duplicates. The condition `if consecutive_count > 2:` should be `if consecutive_count > 1:` because the requirement is to return False if there is more than 1 duplicate of the same number.

To fix this, update the condition as follows:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    if not lst:
        return True
    consecutive_count = 1
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):

        if lst[i] == lst[i - 1]:

Comments on Codes:
"The code has a logical error in handling duplicates. The condition `if consecutive_count > 2:` should be `if consecutive_count > 1:` because the requirement is to return False if there is more than 1 duplicate of the same number.

To fix this, update the condition as follows:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    if not lst:
        return True
    consecutive_count = 1
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        if lst[i] < lst[i - 1]:
            return False
        if lst[i] == lst[i - 1]:
            consecutive_count += 1
            if consecutive_count > 1:
                return False
        else:
            consecutive_count = 1
    return True
```"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The code incorrectly returns `False` when there is more than one duplicate of the same number, even though the task specifies that it should return `False` only if there are more than one duplicate of the same number consecutively. The logic for counting duplicates needs to be revised.

To fix this, modify the code to count duplicates correctly and ensure that it only returns `False` if there are more than one duplicate of the same number consecutively:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    if not lst:
        return True
    consecutive_count = 1
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        if lst[i] < lst[i - 1]:
            return False
        if lst[i] == lst[i - 1]:
            consecutive_count += 1
            if consecutive_count > 2:
                return False
        else:
            consecutive_count = 1
    return True
```

This change ensures that the function only returns `False` if there are more than one duplicate of the same number consecutively, as specified in the task.

Comments on Codes:
"The code incorrectly returns `False` when there is more than one duplicate of the same number, even though the task specifies that it should return `False` only if there are more than one duplicate of the same number consecutively. The logic for counting duplicates needs to be revised.

To fix this, modify the code to count duplicates correctly and ensure that it only returns `False` if there are more than one duplicate of the same number consecutively:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    if not lst:
        return True
    consecutive_count = 1
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        if lst[i] < lst[i - 1]:
            return False
        if lst[i] == lst[i - 1]:
            consecutive_count += 1
            if consecutive_count > 2:
                return False
        else:
            consecutive_count = 1
    return True
```

This change ensures that the function only returns `False` if there are more than one duplicate of the same number consecutively, as specified in the task."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `is_sorted` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. Here is how it would look:

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# is_sorted Function

This software provides a simple utility function to determine whether a list of integers is sorted in ascending order, with an additional constraint on duplicates.

## Main Functionality

The primary function of this software is `is_sorted(lst)`, which checks if a given list of integers is sorted in ascending order. The function also ensures that no number appears more than twice consecutively in the list. If the list meets these criteria, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Function Details

- **is_sorted(lst):**
  - **Input:** A list of non-negative integers.
  - **Output:** A boolean value (`True` or `False`).
  - **Behavior:** 
    - Returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order and no number appears more than twice consecutively.
    - Returns `False` if the list is not sorted or if any number appears more than twice consecutively.

### Examples

- `is_sorted([5])` ➞ `True`
- `is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` ➞ `True`
- `is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5])` ➞ `False`
- `is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])` ➞ `True`
- `is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4])` ➞ `True`
- `is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4])` ➞ `False`

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies. It is implemented in Python and can be used directly in any Python environment.

### Quick Start

1. **Ensure you have Python installed** on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or download the repository** containing the `main.py` file.

3. **Run the function** in a Python environment by importing it from `main.py`:

   ```python
   from main import is_sorted

   # Example usage
   result = is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
   print(result)  # Output: True
   ```

## Usage

To use the `is_sorted` function, simply pass a list of integers to the function and it will return a boolean indicating whether the list is sorted according to the specified rules.

This utility is useful for applications where data integrity and order are crucial, such as in sorting algorithms, data validation, and more.

## Documentation

For further details on the implementation and usage examples, refer to the comments within the `main.py` file. This file contains comprehensive documentation on how the function works and its expected behavior.
