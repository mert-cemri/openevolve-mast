Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and testing a piece of software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to focus on the functionality and correctness of the code without the need for additional presentation or visualization features. What are your thoughts on this?

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `check_dict_case` that checks if all keys in a dictionary are either all lowercase strings or all uppercase strings. If the dictionary is empty or contains non-string keys, the function should return `False`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Check if the dictionary is empty**: If it is, return `False`.
2. **Iterate through the keys**: Check if all keys are strings.
3. **Check the case of the keys**:
   - If all keys are lowercase, return `True`.
   - If all keys are uppercase, return `True`.
   - Otherwise, return `False`.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

Given a dictionary, return True if all keys are strings in lower 
case or all keys are strings in upper case, else return False.
The function should return False if the given dictionary is empty.
Examples:
check_dict_case({"a":"apple", "b":"banana"}) should return True.
check_dict_case({"a":"apple", "A":"banana", "B":"banana"}) should return False.
check_dict_case({"a":"apple", 8:"banana", "a":"apple"}) should return False.
check_dict_case({"Name":"John", "Age":"36", "City":"Houston"}) should return False.
check_dict_case({"STATE":"NC", "ZIP":"12345" }) should return True.

'''

def check_dict_case(d):
    # Check if the dictionary is empty
    if not d:
        return False
    
    # Check if all keys are strings
    if not all(isinstance(key, str) for key in d.keys()):
        return False
    
    # Check if all keys are lowercase
    all_lower = all(key.islower() for key in d.keys())
    
    # Check if all keys are uppercase
    all_upper = all(key.isupper() for key in d.keys())
    
    # Return True if all keys are either all lowercase or all uppercase
    return all_lower or all_upper

```

This implementation checks the conditions as described and returns the appropriate boolean value based on the case of the keys in the dictionary.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `check_dict_case` only uses built-in Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. Here is how it would look:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

# CheckDictCase

CheckDictCase is a simple Python utility function designed to evaluate the case consistency of dictionary keys. It determines whether all keys in a given dictionary are either all lowercase or all uppercase strings. This function is particularly useful for data validation and preprocessing tasks where case consistency is required.

## Main Functionality

The primary function provided by this utility is `check_dict_case(d)`, which performs the following checks:

1. **Empty Dictionary Check**: Returns `False` if the dictionary is empty.
2. **Key Type Check**: Returns `False` if any key in the dictionary is not a string.
3. **Case Consistency Check**: Returns `True` if all keys are either all lowercase or all uppercase strings. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Examples

- `check_dict_case({"a":"apple", "b":"banana"})` returns `True`.
- `check_dict_case({"a":"apple", "A":"banana", "B":"banana"})` returns `False`.
- `check_dict_case({"a":"apple", 8:"banana", "a":"apple"})` returns `False`.
- `check_dict_case({"Name":"John", "Age":"36", "City":"Houston"})` returns `False`.
- `check_dict_case({"STATE":"NC", "ZIP":"12345" })` returns `True`.

## Installation

This utility does not require any external dependencies, making it easy to integrate into any Python project.

### Quick Install

Since there are no external dependencies, you can directly use the function in your Python environment. Simply copy the function code into your project:

```python
def check_dict_case(d):
    # Check if the dictionary is empty
    if not d:
        return False
    # Check if all keys are strings
    if not all(isinstance(key, str) for key in d.keys()):
        return False
    # Check if all keys are lowercase
    all_lower = all(key.islower() for key in d.keys())
    # Check if all keys are uppercase
    all_upper = all(key.isupper() for key in d.keys())
    # Return True if all keys are either all lowercase or all uppercase
    return all_lower or all_upper
```

## Usage

To use the `check_dict_case` function, simply call it with a dictionary as an argument. The function will return a boolean value indicating whether the dictionary keys meet the specified case consistency criteria.

```python
# Example usage
result = check_dict_case({"a": "apple", "b": "banana"})
print(result)  # Output: True
```
