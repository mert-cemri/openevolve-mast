To solve the task, we need to implement the `parse_nested_parens` function in Python. The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus solely on the logic to determine the deepest level of nested parentheses for each group in the input string. Here's how we can approach this:

### Core Function

- **Function Name**: `parse_nested_parens`
  - **Purpose**: To compute the deepest level of nested parentheses for each group in the input string.
  - **Parameters**: A single string `paren_string` containing groups of parentheses separated by spaces.
  - **Returns**: A list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Split the Input String**: Use the `split()` method to separate the groups of parentheses.
2. **Calculate Nesting Levels**: For each group, iterate through the characters and keep track of the current nesting level using a counter. Update the maximum nesting level encountered.
3. **Return the Results**: Compile the maximum nesting levels for each group into a list and return it.

Now, let's implement the function in `main.py`.

#### main.py

```python
# main.py

from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """
    Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.
    For each of the group, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.
    E.g. (()()) has maximum two levels of nesting while ((())) has three.

    >>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
    [2, 3, 1, 3]
    """
    def max_nesting_level(paren_group: str) -> int:
        max_level = 0
        current_level = 0
        for char in paren_group:
            if char == '(':
                current_level += 1
                if current_level > max_level:
                    max_level = current_level
            elif char == ')':
                current_level -= 1
        return max_level

    groups = paren_string.split()
    return [max_nesting_level(group) for group in groups]

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_input = '(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'
    print(parse_nested_parens(example_input))  # Output: [2, 3, 1, 3]
```

This code defines the `parse_nested_parens` function, which calculates the deepest level of nested parentheses for each group in the input string. The function uses a helper function `max_nesting_level` to determine the nesting level for each group. The code is complete and functional, adhering to the task requirements.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external libraries or packages used that need to be specified in a `requirements.txt` file. The code only uses built-in Python functionality, which does not require any additional dependencies.
Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, as follows:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
If you want to include a comment to clarify that no external packages are needed, you can add a comment line as shown above. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Parse Nested Parentheses

This software provides a function to determine the deepest level of nesting for groups of parentheses within a given string. It is designed to handle multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces and return the maximum nesting level for each group.

## Main Functions

The main function provided by this software is `parse_nested_parens`, which takes a string input and returns a list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.

### Function: `parse_nested_parens`

- **Input**: A string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces.
- **Output**: A list of integers, where each integer represents the maximum nesting level of the corresponding group of parentheses.

#### Example

```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    def max_nesting_level(paren_group: str) -> int:
        max_level = 0
        current_level = 0
        for char in paren_group:
            if char == '(':
                current_level += 1
                if current_level > max_level:
                    max_level = current_level
            elif char == ')':
                current_level -= 1
        return max_level

    groups = paren_string.split()
    return [max_nesting_level(group) for group in groups]

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_input = '(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'
    print(parse_nested_parens(example_input))  # Output: [2, 3, 1, 3]
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it simple to set up and use. You only need to have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

   ```

4. The script will execute the example usage and print the output `[2, 3, 1, 3]`, which corresponds to the deepest levels of nesting for each group of parentheses in the example input.

## Documentation

This software is straightforward and does not require additional documentation beyond this manual. The function `parse_nested_parens` is self-contained and can be easily integrated into other Python projects where similar functionality is needed.

 # Parse Nested Parentheses

This software provides a function to determine the deepest level of nesting for groups of parentheses within a given string. It is designed to handle multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces and return the maximum nesting level for each group.

## Main Functions

The main function provided by this software is `parse_nested_parens`, which takes a string input and returns a list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.

### Function: `parse_nested_parens`

- **Input**: A string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces.
- **Output**: A list of integers, where each integer represents the maximum nesting level of the corresponding group of parentheses.

#### Example

```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    def max_nesting_level(paren_group: str) -> int:
        max_level = 0
        current_level = 0
        for char in paren_group:
            if char == '(':
                current_level += 1
                if current_level > max_level:
                    max_level = current_level
            elif char == ')':
                current_level -= 1
        return max_level

    groups = paren_string.split()
    return [max_nesting_level(group) for group in groups]

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_input = '(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'
    print(parse_nested_parens(example_input))  # Output: [2, 3, 1, 3]
```
