# Largest Prime Factor Finder

This software module provides a function to find the largest prime factor of a given integer. It is designed to be simple and efficient, with no external dependencies required.

## Main Function

The main function provided by this module is `largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int`. This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest prime factor of `n`. It assumes that `n` is greater than 1 and is not a prime number.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import largest_prime_factor

# Example 1
result1 = largest_prime_factor(13195)
print(result1)  # Output: 29

# Example 2
result2 = largest_prime_factor(2048)
print(result2)  # Output: 2
```

## Installation

This module does not require any external dependencies, so you can use it directly in your Python environment. Simply ensure that you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the repository** or download the `main.py` file to your local machine.

2. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Run the code**: Use a Python interpreter to execute the code or integrate it into your existing Python projects.

## How to Use

1. **Import the function**: Import the `largest_prime_factor` function from the `main.py` file into your Python script.

2. **Call the function**: Pass an integer greater than 1 (and not a prime) to the function to get its largest prime factor.

3. **Handle the output**: The function will return the largest prime factor, which you can print or use in further calculations.

## Documentation

The function is documented with a docstring that includes example usage. You can view this documentation directly in the `main.py` file or by using Python's built-in help function:

```python
help(largest_prime_factor)
```

This will display the function's docstring, including example inputs and expected outputs.
