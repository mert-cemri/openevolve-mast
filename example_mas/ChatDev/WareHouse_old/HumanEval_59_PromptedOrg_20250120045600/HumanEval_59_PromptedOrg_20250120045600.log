To solve the task, we need to implement the function `largest_prime_factor` which calculates the largest prime factor of a given integer `n`. The function should efficiently find the largest prime factor by iterating through possible factors and checking for divisibility.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Divide out the smallest prime factor (2):** Continuously divide `n` by 2 until it is no longer divisible by 2. This handles all even numbers.

2. **Check for odd factors:** Starting from 3, check each odd number to see if it is a factor of `n`. If it is, divide `n` by this factor until it is no longer divisible.

3. **Continue until `n` becomes 1:** The last factor that divides `n` will be the largest prime factor.

4. **Return the largest factor found.**

Now, let's implement this in the `main.py` file.

def largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int:
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime.
    
    >>> largest_prime_factor(13195)
    29
    >>> largest_prime_factor(2048)
    2
    """
    # Start with the smallest prime factor
    largest_factor = 1
    
    # Remove all factors of 2
    while n % 2 == 0:
        largest_factor = 2
        n //= 2
    
    # Check for odd factors from 3 onwards
    factor = 3
    while factor * factor <= n:
        while n % factor == 0:
            largest_factor = factor
            n //= factor
        factor += 2
    
    # If n is still greater than 1, then it is prime
    if n > 1:
        largest_factor = n
    
    return largest_factor
```

This code efficiently finds the largest prime factor of a given integer `n` by iterating through potential factors and reducing `n` accordingly. The function is designed to handle both even and odd numbers and returns the largest prime factor found.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

For the given code, there are no external dependencies or packages required since it only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for the sake of completeness, it would look like this:

"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code, there are no external dependencies or packages required since it only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for the sake of completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that the project does not rely on any third-party packages. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

The Programmer is correct in their assessment. The provided code for the `largest_prime_factor` function does not require any external libraries or packages beyond the standard Python library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or simply contain a comment indicating that no external dependencies are needed. Here is how the `requirements.txt` file should look:

# Largest Prime Factor Finder

This software module provides a function to find the largest prime factor of a given integer. It is designed to be simple and efficient, with no external dependencies required.

## Main Function

The main function provided by this module is `largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int`. This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest prime factor of `n`. It assumes that `n` is greater than 1 and is not a prime number.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import largest_prime_factor

# Example 1
result1 = largest_prime_factor(13195)
print(result1)  # Output: 29

# Example 2
result2 = largest_prime_factor(2048)
print(result2)  # Output: 2
```

## Installation

This module does not require any external dependencies, so you can use it directly in your Python environment. Simply ensure that you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the repository** or download the `main.py` file to your local machine.

2. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Run the code**: Use a Python interpreter to execute the code or integrate it into your existing Python projects.

## How to Use

1. **Import the function**: Import the `largest_prime_factor` function from the `main.py` file into your Python script.

2. **Call the function**: Pass an integer greater than 1 (and not a prime) to the function to get its largest prime factor.

3. **Handle the output**: The function will return the largest prime factor, which you can print or use in further calculations.

## Documentation

The function is documented with a docstring that includes example usage. You can view this documentation directly in the `main.py` file or by using Python's built-in help function:

```python
help(largest_prime_factor)
```

This will display the function's docstring, including example inputs and expected outputs.

 # Largest Prime Factor Finder

This software module provides a function to find the largest prime factor of a given integer. It is designed to be simple and efficient, with no external dependencies required.

## Main Function

The main function provided by this module is `largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int`. This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest prime factor of `n`. It assumes that `n` is greater than 1 and is not a prime number.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import largest_prime_factor

# Example 1
result1 = largest_prime_factor(13195)
print(result1)  # Output: 29

# Example 2
result2 = largest_prime_factor(2048)
print(result2)  # Output: 2
```
