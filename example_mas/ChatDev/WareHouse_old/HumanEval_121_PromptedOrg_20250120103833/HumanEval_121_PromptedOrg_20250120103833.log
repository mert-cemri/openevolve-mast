To solve the task, we need to implement a function `solution` that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all odd elements that are located at even indices (0-based index) in the list. The task is straightforward and can be implemented in a single file, `main.py`.

Here is the breakdown of the function:

- **Function Name**: `solution`
- **Purpose**: To calculate the sum of odd integers that are located at even indices in the given list.
- **Parameters**: A list of integers `lst`.
- **Returns**: An integer representing the sum of the odd elements at even indices.

Now, let's implement the code in `main.py`.

FILENAME

```python
'''

DOCSTRING

Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions.

Examples:
solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) ==> 12
solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ==> 9
solution([30, 13, 24, 321]) ==> 0

'''

def solution(lst):
    return sum(lst[i] for i in range(0, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 != 0)

```

This code defines the `solution` function, which iterates over the list `lst` using a step of 2 to access even indices. It checks if the element at each even index is odd, and if so, adds it to the sum. The function then returns the total sum.

6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

# Solution User Manual

## Introduction

This software provides a simple solution to a specific problem: given a non-empty list of integers, it returns the sum of all the odd elements that are in even positions (0-indexed) in the list. This functionality can be useful in various computational tasks where such specific filtering and summation are required.

## Main Function

The main function of the software is `solution(lst)`, which takes a list of integers as input and returns an integer representing the sum of all odd numbers located at even indices in the list.

### Function Signature

```python
def solution(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions."""
```

### Examples

- `solution([5, 8, 7, 1])` returns `12`
- `solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3])` returns `9`
- `solution([30, 13, 24, 321])` returns `0`

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to set up and use. You only need to have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the repository**: If the code is hosted in a repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

4. **Run the code**: You can execute the function by running the `main.py` file in a Python environment:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

To use the `solution` function, you can either import it into your own Python script or run it directly in an interactive Python session.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import solution

# Example list
numbers = [5, 8, 7, 1]

# Get the sum of odd elements at even positions
result = solution(numbers)

print(result)  # Output: 12
```

## Documentation

For further details on the implementation and usage of the function, you can refer to the docstring provided within the code. The docstring includes a brief description of the function's purpose and example usages.

## Support

For any issues or questions regarding the software, please contact our support team or refer to the documentation provided within the code. We are committed to providing assistance to ensure the software meets your needs.
