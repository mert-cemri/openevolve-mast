Given the task at hand, which involves writing software code to convert integers to Roman numerals, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a software tool that performs a specific function, and Python is a suitable language for such a task. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" is indeed the most appropriate product modality for this task, as it involves writing a functional piece of software code to perform a specific conversion task. Let's proceed with this modality.

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `int_to_mini_roman` that converts a given integer to its Roman numeral equivalent in lowercase. The function should handle integers from 1 to 1000. We will implement this in a single Python file, `main.py`.

### Core Function:
- **int_to_mini_roman(number):** This function will convert an integer to its Roman numeral representation in lowercase.

Now, let's implement the code in the specified format.

    roman_numerals = [

        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),
        (1, 'I')
    ]
    
    result = []
    for value, numeral in roman_numerals:
        while number >= value:
            result.append(numeral)
            number -= value

# print(int_to_mini_roman(152)) # Output: 'clii'
# print(int_to_mini_roman(426)) # Output: 'cdxxvi'
```

This code defines the function `int_to_mini_roman` which uses a list of tuples to map integer values to their corresponding Roman numeral symbols. It iterates over this list, appending the appropriate symbols to the result list while decrementing the input number. Finally, it joins the list into a string and converts it to lowercase before returning it.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required to run the function `int_to_mini_roman`. The function only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."
