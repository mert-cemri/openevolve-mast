Given the task is to write a function in Python that processes a list of integers, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application" since it involves implementing a software tool. This aligns with the requirement to write and fix code. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To solve the task, we need to implement the `rolling_max` function in Python. This function will take a list of integers and return a list where each element is the maximum value encountered in the list up to that point. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Function Name**: `rolling_max`
   - **Purpose**: To compute the rolling maximum of a list of integers.

2. **Input**: A list of integers.
3. **Output**: A list of integers representing the rolling maximum.

4. **Logic**:
   - Initialize an empty list to store the rolling maximums.
   - Iterate through the input list.
   - For each element, compare it with the current maximum and update the current maximum if the element is larger.
   - Append the current maximum to the rolling maximum list.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

DOCSTRING

'''

from typing import List

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment
    in the sequence.
    >>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    """
    if not numbers:
        return []
    
    rolling_max_list = []
    current_max = numbers[0]
    
    for number in numbers:
        if number > current_max:
            current_max = number
        rolling_max_list.append(current_max)
    
    return rolling_max_list
```

This code defines the `rolling_max` function which calculates the rolling maximum for a list of integers as specified. The function iterates over the list, updating the current maximum and appending it to the result list.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Since the provided code does not use any external libraries or packages, there are no dependencies required for the project to run. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
```
This indicates that no additional packages need to be installed for the code to function correctly. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Rolling Max Function

This software provides a utility function to compute the rolling maximum of a list of integers. The rolling maximum is the highest value encountered in the list up to each point in the sequence.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `rolling_max`, which takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of the rolling maximum values.

### Function Definition

```python
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum elements found until the given moment
    in the sequence.
    
    Example:
    >>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    """
```

### How It Works

- The function iterates through the list of integers.
- It keeps track of the current maximum value encountered.
- For each integer in the list, it updates the current maximum if the integer is greater than the current maximum.
- It appends the current maximum to the result list.
- Finally, it returns the list of rolling maximum values.

## Installation

To use this function, you need to have Python installed on your system. The function does not require any additional dependencies beyond the standard Python library.

### Quick Install

1. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone or download the repository containing the `main.py` file.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.
3. Run the Python interpreter and import the function:

```bash
python
```

```python
from main import rolling_max
```

4. Use the function by passing a list of integers:

```python
result = rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
```

## Documentation

The function is straightforward and does not require additional documentation. The docstring within the function provides an example of its usage.

For any further questions or support, please contact our support team.
