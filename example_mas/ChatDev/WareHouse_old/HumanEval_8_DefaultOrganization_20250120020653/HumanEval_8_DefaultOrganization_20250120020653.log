I agree with your assessment. The "Application" modality is indeed suitable for this task as it involves writing and implementing a piece of software code in Python. This aligns well with the customer's requirement.

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To complete the task, we need to implement the `sum_product` function as described in the task. Since the task specifies not to implement a GUI and only to write the necessary code, we will focus solely on the function implementation. The function should calculate the sum and product of a list of integers and return them as a tuple. Here's the implementation:

main.py

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """
    total_sum = sum(numbers)
    total_product = 1
    for number in numbers:
        total_product *= number
    return total_sum, total_product
```

This code defines the `sum_product` function which calculates the sum and product of a list of integers. If the list is empty, it returns `(0, 1)` as specified. The function uses Python's built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum and a loop to calculate the product.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required beyond the standard Python library. The function `sum_product` only uses basic Python operations and the `typing` module, which is part of the standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file can be left empty or omitted entirely since no additional packages are needed.

However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any third-party packages.

"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required beyond the standard Python library. The function `sum_product` only uses basic Python operations and the `typing` module, which is part of the standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file can be left empty or omitted entirely since no additional packages are needed.
However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that the project does not rely on any third-party packages. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I agree with the Programmer's assessment. The provided code in `main.py` does not require any external dependencies beyond the standard Python library. The function `sum_product` utilizes basic Python operations and the `typing` module, which is included in the standard library. Therefore, a `requirements.txt` file is not necessary for this project.

However, for the sake of completeness and to adhere to best practices, you can include a `requirements.txt` file with a comment indicating that no external dependencies are required. Here is how it would look:

# SumProduct Software

This software provides a simple utility function to calculate the sum and product of a list of integers. It is designed to be lightweight and requires no external dependencies.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this software is encapsulated in the `sum_product` function. This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing two elements:
- The sum of all integers in the list.
- The product of all integers in the list.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import sum_product

# Example 1: Empty list
result = sum_product([])
print(result)  # Output: (0, 1)

# Example 2: List with integers
result = sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(result)  # Output: (10, 24)
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external libraries or dependencies. You only need Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or download the `main.py` file to your local machine.

2. **Ensure Python is installed** on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Run the script** using Python. No additional setup is required.

## How to Use

1. **Import the Function**: Import the `sum_product` function from the `main.py` file.

2. **Call the Function**: Pass a list of integers to the `sum_product` function to get the sum and product.

3. **Handle the Output**: The function returns a tuple with the sum and product, which you can use as needed in your application.

## Documentation

### Function Signature

```python
def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `numbers`: A list of integers for which the sum and product are to be calculated.

- **Returns**:
  - A tuple containing the sum and product of the integers in the list. If the list is empty, it returns `(0, 1)`.

### Edge Cases

- **Empty List**: The function handles empty lists by returning `(0, 1)`, where 0 is the sum and 1 is the product.

## Additional Information

This software is designed to be simple and efficient for basic numerical operations. It can be easily integrated into larger projects where such functionality is required. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to contact our support team.

- The sum of all integers in the list.
- The product of all integers in the list.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import sum_product

# Example 1: Empty list
result = sum_product([])
print(result)  # Output: (0, 1)

# Example 2: List with integers
result = sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(result)  # Output: (10, 24)
```
