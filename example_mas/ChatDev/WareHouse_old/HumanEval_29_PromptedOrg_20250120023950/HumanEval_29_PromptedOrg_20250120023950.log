I agree. An "Application" is the most appropriate modality for this task as it involves delivering a functional piece of software code. This aligns well with the customer's request to write and fix code. Let's proceed with this modality.

To complete the task, we need to implement the function `filter_by_prefix` in Python. This function will filter a list of strings, returning only those that start with a specified prefix. We will implement this function in a single file named `main.py`.

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Name**: `filter_by_prefix`
   - **Purpose**: To filter an input list of strings and return only those that start with a given prefix.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `strings`: A list of strings to be filtered.
     - `prefix`: A string prefix to filter the list by.
   - **Returns**: A list of strings that start with the given prefix.

Now, let's write the code for this function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

Filter an input list of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix.

'''

from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Filter an input list of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix.
    >>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a')
    []
    >>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
    ['abc', 'array']
    """
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```

This code defines the `filter_by_prefix` function, which uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `strings` and includes only those strings that start with the specified `prefix`. The function returns this filtered list.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

- **Parameters**:
  - `strings` (List[str]): The list of strings to be filtered.
  - `prefix` (str): The prefix to filter the strings by.
- **Returns**: List[str] - A list of strings that start with the specified prefix.

#### Example Usage

```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Filter an input list of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix.
    >>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a')
    []
    >>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
    ['abc', 'array']
    """
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
