We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

```

This code implements the `tri(n)` function to generate the Tribonacci sequence as per the given rules. It handles the base cases and iteratively calculates the sequence for each subsequent number. The function returns a list of the first `n + 1` numbers in the sequence.

[2025-20-01 13:55:22 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 To solve the task, we need to implement a function `tri(n)` that returns the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence as described. We will focus on implementing the logic in a single Python file without any GUI, as the task specifically requests not to implement a GUI interface.

### Core Function

- **Function `tri(n)`**: This function will calculate and return the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence based on the given recurrence relations.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Tribonacci Sequence Generator

This software provides a simple implementation of a Tribonacci sequence generator. The Tribonacci sequence is a variation of the well-known Fibonacci sequence, with its own unique recurrence relations.

## Main Functions

The main function of this software is to generate the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence based on the input `n`. The sequence is defined by the following rules:
- `tri(1) = 3`
- `tri(n) = 1 + n / 2`, if `n` is even.
- `tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1)`, if `n` is odd.

### Example Usage

To generate the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence, you can use the `tri` function. For example:
```python
print(tri(3))  # Output: [1, 3, 2, 8]
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it easy to set up and use. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - You can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Change into the project directory:
     ```
     cd <project-directory>
     ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   - You can run the script using Python:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```

## How to Use

1. **Open the `main.py` file:**
   - This file contains the implementation of the Tribonacci sequence generator.

2. **Modify the Input:**
   - You can change the input value `n` in the `tri` function call to generate a different number of terms in the sequence.

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script to see the output of the Tribonacci sequence for your specified input.

## Documentation

For more detailed information on the Tribonacci sequence and its properties, you can refer to mathematical resources or online documentation related to sequence generation and recurrence relations.

This software is designed to be simple and straightforward, providing an easy way to explore the Tribonacci sequence without any additional complexity.
