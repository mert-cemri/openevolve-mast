Given the nature of the task, which involves writing a function to determine if a number is the product of three prime numbers, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This would allow us to implement the necessary code in Python and ensure it functions as desired. What are your thoughts on this?

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `is_multiply_prime(a)` that checks if a given number `a` is the product of exactly three prime numbers. Since `a` is less than 100, we can use a straightforward approach to check this condition.

Here is the plan:

1. **Function `is_prime(n)`:** A helper function to check if a number `n` is prime.
2. **Function `is_multiply_prime(a)`:** The main function that checks if `a` is the product of exactly three prime numbers.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python

'''

This module contains a function to check if a given number is the product of exactly three prime numbers.

'''

def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def is_multiply_prime(a):
    """Return True if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, False otherwise."""
    primes = [i for i in range(2, 100) if is_prime(i)]
    
    # Check combinations of three primes
    for i in range(len(primes)):
        for j in range(i, len(primes)):
            for k in range(j, len(primes)):
                if primes[i] * primes[j] * primes[k] == a:
                    return True
    return False

```

This code defines two functions: `is_prime` to determine if a number is prime, and `is_multiply_prime` to check if the input number `a` is the product of exactly three prime numbers. The function iterates through combinations of prime numbers to find a match.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses standard Python libraries and functions. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty or not necessary. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that there are no additional packages needed beyond the standard Python library. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

The main function provided by this software is `is_multiply_prime(a)`. This function checks if the input number `a` is the product of exactly three prime numbers. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Example

```python
is_multiply_prime(30)  # Returns: True, because 30 = 2 * 3 * 5
is_multiply_prime(28)  # Returns: False, because 28 is not the product of three primes
```

## Installation

There are no external dependencies required for this software. It is implemented purely in Python and can be run in any standard Python environment.

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**

   Change your directory to the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**

   You can run the code directly using Python. Open a terminal and execute:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Import the Function:**

   To use the `is_multiply_prime` function in your own scripts, first import it:

   ```python
   from main import is_multiply_prime
   ```

2. **Call the Function:**

   Pass the number you want to check as an argument to the function:

   ```python
   result = is_multiply_prime(30)
   print(result)  # Output: True
   ```

## Documentation

The function `is_multiply_prime(a)` works by first generating a list of prime numbers less than 100. It then checks all possible combinations of three primes to see if their product equals the input number `a`.

### Prime Checking

The helper function `is_prime(n)` is used to determine if a number `n` is prime. It checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`.

### Limitations

- The function is designed to work only with numbers less than 100.
- It assumes that the input is a positive integer.
