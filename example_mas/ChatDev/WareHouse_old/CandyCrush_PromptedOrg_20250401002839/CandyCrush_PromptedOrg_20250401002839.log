Given the customer's requirement for an interactive match-3 puzzle game reminiscent of Candy Crush, the most suitable product modality would be an Application. This modality allows for interactive gameplay, visual representation, real-time updates, and user interaction, all of which are essential for this type of game.

I suggest we choose "Application" as the product modality.

I completely agree with your assessment. The "Application" modality is indeed the most suitable choice, as it allows us to deliver interactive gameplay, dynamic visual updates, real-time scoring, and user-friendly interactions, all of which are critical for a match-3 puzzle game.

Since we are aligned on this decision, I will finalize our choice.

Here is a new customer's task: Implement a match-3 puzzle game reminiscent of Candy Crush. Represent the board and let users swap adjacent candies to form matches of three or more. Matches are cleared, new candies appear, and scoring is tracked. The board updates after each valid move. Incorporate chain reactions when candies fall and possibly track moves or time-based constraints..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Implement a match-3 puzzle game reminiscent of Candy Crush. Represent the board and let users swap adjacent candies to form matches of three or more. Matches are cleared, new candies appear, and scoring is tracked. The board updates after each valid move. Incorporate chain reactions when candies fall and possibly track moves or time-based constraints.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

### Step-by-step Plan:

1. **Define the core classes and methods:**
   - `CandyCrushGame`: Main class to manage the game logic, board state, scoring, and moves.
   - `Candy`: Enum class to represent different candy types.
   - Methods for initializing the board, swapping candies, checking matches, clearing matches, dropping candies, refilling the board, and checking game over conditions.

2. **File Structure:**
   - `main.py`: Entry point of the game, handles user interaction.
   - `game.py`: Contains the core game logic and classes.

---

## Core Classes and Methods:

### File: `game.py`

- Class `Candy`: Enum representing different candy types.
- Class `CandyCrushGame`: Main game logic.
  - `__init__(self, rows, cols)`: Initializes the game board.
  - `swap_candies(self, pos1, pos2)`: Swaps two adjacent candies.
  - `find_matches(self)`: Finds all matches on the board.
  - `clear_matches(self, matches)`: Clears matched candies and updates score.
  - `drop_candies(self)`: Drops candies to fill empty spaces.
  - `fill_board(self)`: Refills the board with new candies.
  - `is_valid_swap(self, pos1, pos2)`: Checks if a swap is valid.
  - `has_possible_moves(self)`: Checks if there are possible moves left.
  - `print_board(self)`: Prints the current state of the board.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Implement a match-3 puzzle game reminiscent of Candy Crush. Represent the board and let users swap adjacent candies to form matches of three or more. Matches are cleared, new candies appear, and scoring is tracked. The board updates after each valid move. Incorporate chain reactions when candies fall and possibly track moves or time-based constraints..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

Highest Priority Comment:
The provided `main.py` file does not contain any executable Python code; it only includes the text `python main.py`, which is invalid and will result in a syntax error. This prevents users from interacting with the game, violating regulation 6.

Suggestion for Revision:
Replace the current content of `main.py` with executable Python code that initializes the game, handles user input, and provides an interactive loop. For example, you can implement a simple command-line interface as follows:

```python
from game import CandyCrushGame

def get_user_input():
    try:
        pos1 = tuple(map(int, input("Enter first candy position (row col): ").split()))
        pos2 = tuple(map(int, input("Enter second candy position (row col): ").split()))
        return pos1, pos2
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter row and column numbers separated by a space.")
        return None, None

def main():
    game = CandyCrushGame()
    while True:
        game.print_board()
        if not game.has_possible_moves():
            print("No more possible moves! Game Over.")
            break
        pos1, pos2 = get_user_input()
        if pos1 is None or pos2 is None:
            continue
        if not game.swap_candies(pos1, pos2):
            print("Invalid swap or no match created. Try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revision ensures that the game is directly operable, interactive, and fully meets the user's requirements.

Comments on Codes:
"Highest Priority Comment:
The provided `main.py` file does not contain any executable Python code; it only includes the text `python main.py`, which is invalid and will result in a syntax error. This prevents users from interacting with the game, violating regulation 6.

Suggestion for Revision:
Replace the current content of `main.py` with executable Python code that initializes the game, handles user input, and provides an interactive loop. For example, you can implement a simple command-line interface as follows:

```python
from game import CandyCrushGame

def get_user_input():
    try:
        pos1 = tuple(map(int, input("Enter first candy position (row col): ").split()))
        pos2 = tuple(map(int, input("Enter second candy position (row col): ").split()))
        return pos1, pos2
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter row and column numbers separated by a space.")
        return None, None

def main():
    game = CandyCrushGame()
    while True:
        game.print_board()
        if not game.has_possible_moves():
            print("No more possible moves! Game Over.")
            break
        pos1, pos2 = get_user_input()
        if pos1 is None or pos2 is None:
            continue
        if not game.swap_candies(pos1, pos2):
            print("Invalid swap or no match created. Try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revision ensures that the game is directly operable, interactive, and fully meets the user's requirements."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation lacks validation for user input positions in the `swap_candies` method. Specifically, it does not check if the positions provided by the user are within the board boundaries, which could lead to runtime errors (IndexError) if invalid positions are entered.

Suggestions on Revision:

To fix this issue, add explicit boundary checking in the `swap_candies` method before attempting to access the board elements. Modify the `swap_candies` method in the `CandyCrushGame` class as follows:

 Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation lacks validation for user input positions in the `swap_candies` method. Specifically, it does not check if the positions provided by the user are within the board boundaries, which could lead to runtime errors (IndexError) if invalid positions are entered.

Suggestions on Revision:

To fix this issue, add explicit boundary checking in the `swap_candies` method before attempting to access the board elements. Modify the `swap_candies` method in the `CandyCrushGame` class as follows:

```python
def swap_candies(self, pos1, pos2):
    if not self.is_valid_swap(pos1, pos2):
        return False
    r1, c1 = pos1
    r2, c2 = pos2
    # Additional boundary check
    if not (0 <= r1 < self.rows and 0 <= c1 < self.cols and 0 <= r2 < self.rows and 0 <= c2 < self.cols):
        return False
    self.board[r1][c1], self.board[r2][c2] = self.board[r2][c2], self.board[r1][c1]
    matches = self.find_matches()
    if matches:
        self.moves += 1
        while matches:
            self.clear_matches(matches)
            self.drop_candies()
            self.fill_board()
            matches = self.find_matches()
        return True
    else:
        # Swap back if no matches
        self.board[r1][c1], self.board[r2][c2] = self.board[r2][c2], self.board[r1][c1]
        return False
```

This ensures that invalid positions provided by the user are handled gracefully, preventing potential runtime errors and improving the robustness of the game.

Comments on Codes:
"Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation lacks validation for user input positions in the `swap_candies` method. Specifically, it does not check if the positions provided by the user are within the board boundaries, which could lead to runtime errors (IndexError) if invalid positions are entered.

Suggestions on Revision:

To fix this issue, add explicit boundary checking in the `swap_candies` method before attempting to access the board elements. Modify the `swap_candies` method in the `CandyCrushGame` class as follows:

```python
def swap_candies(self, pos1, pos2):
    if not self.is_valid_swap(pos1, pos2):
        return False
    r1, c1 = pos1
    r2, c2 = pos2
    # Additional boundary check
    if not (0 <= r1 < self.rows and 0 <= c1 < self.cols and 0 <= r2 < self.rows and 0 <= c2 < self.cols):
        return False
    self.board[r1][c1], self.board[r2][c2] = self.board[r2][c2], self.board[r1][c1]
    matches = self.find_matches()
    if matches:
        self.moves += 1
        while matches:
            self.clear_matches(matches)
            self.drop_candies()
            self.fill_board()
            matches = self.find_matches()
        return True
    else:
        # Swap back if no matches
        self.board[r1][c1], self.board[r2][c2] = self.board[r2][c2], self.board[r1][c1]
        return False
```

This ensures that invalid positions provided by the user are handled gracefully, preventing potential runtime errors and improving the robustness of the game."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

| **task_prompt** | Implement a match-3 puzzle game reminiscent of Candy Crush. Represent the board and let users swap adjacent candies to form matches of three or more. Matches are cleared, new candies appear, and scoring is tracked. The board updates after each valid move. Incorporate chain reactions when candies fall and possibly track moves or time-based constraints. |

Modify the swap_candies method in the CandyCrushGame class as follows:\n\npython\ndef swap_candies(self, pos1, pos2):\n    if not self.is_valid_swap(pos1, pos2):\n        return False\n    r1, c1 = pos1\n    r2, c2 = pos2\n    # Additional boundary check\n    if not (0 &lt;= r1 &lt; self.rows and 0 &lt;= c1 &lt; self.cols and 0 &lt;= r2 &lt; self.rows and 0 &lt;= c2 &lt; self.cols):\n        return False\n    self.board[r1][c1], self.board[r2][c2] = self.board[r2][c2], self.board[r1][c1]\n    matches = self.find_matches()\n    if matches:\n        self.moves += 1\n        while matches:\n            self.clear_matches(matches)\n            self.drop_candies()\n            self.fill_board()\n            matches = self.find_matches()\n        return True\n    else:\n        # Swap back if no matches\n        self.board[r1][c1], self.board[r2][c2] = self.board[r2][c2], self.board[r1][c1]\n        return False\n\n\nThis ensures that invalid positions provided by the user are handled gracefully, preventing potential runtime errors and improving the robustness of the game.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Implement a match-3 puzzle game reminiscent of Candy Crush. Represent the board and let users swap adjacent candies to form matches of three or more. Matches are cleared, new candies appear, and scoring is tracked. The board updates after each valid move. Incorporate chain reactions when candies fall and possibly track moves or time-based constraints..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The highest priority issue identified is:

The current implementation does not include any move or time-based constraints as mentioned in the user's requirement: "possibly track moves or time-based constraints." The game currently tracks moves made but does not enforce any limit or provide a mechanism to end the game based on moves or time constraints.

Suggested Revision:

To fully meet the user's requirement, implement either a move limit or a time-based constraint. For instance, you can add a maximum number of moves or a countdown timer. Here's how you can implement a simple move limit:

1. Add a `max_moves` attribute to the `CandyCrushGame` class constructor:

```python
def __init__(self, rows=8, cols=8, max_moves=30):
    self.rows = rows
    self.cols = cols
    self.max_moves = max_moves
    self.board = [[random.choice(list(Candy)) for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
    self.score = 0
    self.moves = 0
    self.remove_initial_matches()
```

2. Modify the main game loop in `main.py` to check for move limits:

```python
def main():
    game = CandyCrushGame(max_moves=30)
    while True:
        game.print_board()
        if game.moves >= game.max_moves:
            print("Reached maximum number of moves! Game Over.")
            break
        if not game.has_possible_moves():
            print("No more possible moves! Game Over.")
            break
        pos1, pos2 = get_user_input(game.rows, game.cols)
        if pos1 is None or pos2 is None:
            continue
        if not game.swap_candies(pos1, pos2):
            print("Invalid swap or no match created. Try again.")
```

This ensures the game meets the user's requirement by incorporating a move-based constraint, making the software fully compliant with the task description.

The game currently tracks moves made but does not enforce any limit or provide a mechanism to end the game based on moves or time constraints.\n\nSuggested Revision:\n\nTo fully meet the user\'s requirement, implement either a move limit or a time-based constraint. For instance, you can add a maximum number of moves or a countdown timer. Here\'s how you can implement a simple move limit:\n\n1. Add a max_moves attribute to the CandyCrushGame class constructor:\n\npython\ndef __init__(self, rows=8, cols=8, max_moves=30):\n    self.rows = rows\n    self.cols = cols\n    self.max_moves = max_moves\n    self.board = [[random.choice(list(Candy)) for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n    self.score = 0\n    self.moves = 0\n    self.remove_initial_matches()\n\n\n2. Modify the main game loop in main.py to check for move limits:\n\npython\ndef main():\n    game = CandyCrushGame(max_moves=30)\n    while True:\n        game.print_board()\n        if game.moves &gt;= game.max_moves:\n            print("Reached maximum number of moves!

Try again.")\n\n\nThis ensures the game meets the user\'s requirement by incorporating a move-based constraint, making the software fully compliant with the task description.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"The highest priority issue identified is:

The current implementation does not include any move or time-based constraints as mentioned in the user's requirement: "possibly track moves or time-based constraints." The game currently tracks moves made but does not enforce any limit or provide a mechanism to end the game based on moves or time constraints.

Suggested Revision:

To fully meet the user's requirement, implement either a move limit or a time-based constraint. For instance, you can add a maximum number of moves or a countdown timer. Here's how you can implement a simple move limit:

1. Add a `max_moves` attribute to the `CandyCrushGame` class constructor:

```python
def __init__(self, rows=8, cols=8, max_moves=30):
    self.rows = rows
    self.cols = cols
    self.max_moves = max_moves
    self.board = [[random.choice(list(Candy)) for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
    self.score = 0
    self.moves = 0
    self.remove_initial_matches()
```

2. Modify the main game loop in `main.py` to check for move limits:

```python
def main():
    game = CandyCrushGame(max_moves=30)
    while True:
        game.print_board()
        if game.moves >= game.max_moves:
            print("Reached maximum number of moves! Game Over.")
            break
        if not game.has_possible_moves():
            print("No more possible moves! Game Over.")
            break
        pos1, pos2 = get_user_input(game.rows, game.cols)
        if pos1 is None or pos2 is None:
            continue
        if not game.swap_candies(pos1, pos2):
            print("Invalid swap or no match created. Try again.")
```

This ensures the game meets the user's requirement by incorporating a move-based constraint, making the software fully compliant with the task description."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Here is a new customer's task: Implement a match-3 puzzle game reminiscent of Candy Crush. Represent the board and let users swap adjacent candies to form matches of three or more. Matches are cleared, new candies appear, and scoring is tracked. The board updates after each valid move. Incorporate chain reactions when candies fall and possibly track moves or time-based constraints..
To complete the task, you will review the code submitted by programmers, identify issues, and suggest improvements to meet quality standards.]

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

# Candy Crush Match-3 Puzzle Game

Welcome to the Candy Crush Match-3 Puzzle Game! This Python-based game provides a fun and engaging experience reminiscent of the popular Candy Crush game. Swap adjacent candies to form matches of three or more, clear candies, score points, and enjoy exciting chain reactions!

## 🎮 Game Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Swap adjacent candies to create matches of three or more.
- **Chain Reactions:** Matches trigger candies above to fall, potentially creating additional matches.
- **Scoring System:** Earn points for every candy cleared.
- **Move-Based Constraints:** Challenge yourself by completing the game within a limited number of moves.
- **Dynamic Board:** The board updates after each valid move, introducing new candies.

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.

### Dependencies

This game does not require any external dependencies. However, ensure you have Python installed.

You can verify your Python installation by running:

```bash
python --version
```

### Downloading the Game

Clone or download the game files (`game.py` and `main.py`) to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

## 🎲 How to Play

### Starting the Game

Navigate to the directory containing the game files and run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Gameplay Instructions

1. **View the Board:**  
   The game board will display candies represented by colored emojis:
   - 🔴 (Red)
   - 🟢 (Green)
   - 🔵 (Blue)
   - 🟡 (Yellow)
   - 🟣 (Purple)

2. **Making a Move:**  
   Enter positions of two adjacent candies you wish to swap. Positions are entered as row and column numbers separated by a space.

   Example:
   ```
   Enter first candy position (row col): 3 4
   Enter second candy position (row col): 3 5
   ```

   **Note:** Rows and columns are zero-indexed (0 to 7 for an 8x8 board).

3. **Validating Moves:**  
   - Moves must swap adjacent candies horizontally or vertically.
   - A valid move must result in at least one match of three or more candies.
   - Invalid swaps will revert automatically, prompting you to try again.

4. **Scoring:**  
   - Each candy cleared earns you 10 points.
   - Chain reactions can significantly boost your score.

5. **Move Constraints:**  
   - You have a maximum of 30 moves to achieve the highest possible score.
   - The game ends when you reach the maximum number of moves or when no more valid moves are available.

### Ending the Game

The game concludes under two conditions:
- You've used all available moves.
- No more valid moves are possible on the board.

Your final score will be displayed at the end of the game.

## 📌 Tips and Tricks

- Plan your moves carefully to maximize chain reactions.
- Prioritize moves that clear larger groups of candies for higher scores.
- Keep an eye on the number of moves remaining.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

- **Invalid Input:** Ensure you enter positions correctly as two integers separated by a space.
- **Positions Out of Bounds:** Rows and columns must be within the board dimensions (0-7 for an 8x8 board).
