Given the task at hand, which involves writing a function to process a string and return an array of words, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task is purely code-based and does not require any visual representation or documentation. An application can effectively implement and demonstrate the functionality of the code. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. Since the task is focused on writing and demonstrating a piece of code, an "Application" is indeed the most appropriate product modality. It allows us to implement the function and ensure it works as intended without any additional visual or document-based elements.

To complete the task, we need to focus on the core functionality of splitting a string into words based on spaces or commas. The task explicitly states not to implement a GUI interface, so we will disregard the GUI requirement mentioned in your instructions and focus solely on the core functionality in Python.

Let's define the necessary function and implement it in a single Python file, `main.py`.

### Core Function

- **Function Name**: `words_string`
  - **Purpose**: To split a given string into words separated by spaces or commas and return them as a list.

Now, let's implement the code in `main.py`.

#### main.py

```python
'''

This module contains a function to split a string into words based on spaces or commas.

'''

def words_string(s):
    """
    Splits a string into words separated by spaces or commas and returns them as a list.
    
    Parameters:
    s (str): The input string containing words separated by spaces or commas.
    
    Returns:
    list: A list of words extracted from the input string.
    
    Examples:
    words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
    """
    # Replace commas with spaces and then split by spaces
    return s.replace(',', ' ').split()

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(words_string("Hi, my name is John"))  # Output: ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    print(words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six"))  # Output: ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
```

This code defines the `words_string` function, which replaces commas with spaces and then splits the string by spaces to return a list of words. The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how the function works with the provided examples.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given task and code, there are no external dependencies or packages required to run the `words_string` function. The function only uses basic string operations that are part of Python's standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed.
Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project

As the Chief Executive Officer, I agree with the Programmer's assessment. The `words_string` function utilizes only basic string operations that are part of Python's standard library, and therefore, no external dependencies are required for this project. Consequently, the `requirements.txt` file should be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file should look:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

This ensures clarity and maintains the simplicity of the project setup. If there are any future enhancements or additional features that require external packages, the `requirements.txt` file can be updated accordingly.

# Words String Splitter

This software module provides a simple function to split a string of words separated by commas or spaces into an array of words. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, requiring no external dependencies.

## Main Function

The main function provided by this module is `words_string(s)`. This function takes a single string input and returns a list of words extracted from the input string. The words in the input string can be separated by either commas or spaces.

### Function Signature

```python
def words_string(s):
    """
    Splits a string into words separated by spaces or commas and returns them as a list.
    
    Parameters:
    s (str): The input string containing words separated by spaces or commas.
    
    Returns:
    list: A list of words extracted from the input string.
    """
