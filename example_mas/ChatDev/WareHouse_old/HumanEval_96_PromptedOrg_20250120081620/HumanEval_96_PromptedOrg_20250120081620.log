Given the nature of the task, which involves writing a function to solve a coding problem, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application" since it involves implementing a software tool using Python. This aligns with the requirement to write and test code. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. The task requires implementing a function in Python, which fits well within the "Application" modality. This allows us to focus on the code functionality without any additional interfaces. Let's proceed with this modality.

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `count_up_to` that takes a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list of prime numbers less than `n`. We will implement this function in a single Python file named `main.py`.

### Core Function:
- **count_up_to(n)**: This function will determine all prime numbers less than `n` and return them in a list.

### Helper Function:
- **is_prime(num)**: This helper function will check if a given number `num` is a prime number.

Now, let's implement the code in `main.py`.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to find all prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer.

def is_prime(num):
    """

    """
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def count_up_to(n):
    """
    Implement a function that takes a non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n.

    """
    primes = []
    for num in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(num):
            primes.append(num)
    return primes
```

This code defines the `count_up_to` function, which uses the helper function `is_prime` to check for prime numbers. The `is_prime` function efficiently checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number. The `count_up_to` function iterates through numbers from 2 to `n-1`, collecting those that are prime into a list, which it then returns.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The code relies solely on Python's built-in functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file does not need to specify any dependencies. Here is how the `requirements.txt` file should look:
```

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:
