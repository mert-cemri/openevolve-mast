To address the customer's task, we need to focus on implementing the `fizz_buzz` function correctly. The task does not require a GUI, so we will only focus on the logic needed to solve the problem as described in the docstring. Here's the plan:

### Core Function
- **fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int**: This function will iterate through numbers less than `n` and count how many times the digit '7' appears in numbers divisible by 11 or 13.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains the implementation of the fizz_buzz function which counts the number of times the digit '7' appears in numbers less than a given integer n that are divisible by 11 or 13.

'''

def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
    
    >>> fizz_buzz(50)
    0
    >>> fizz_buzz(78)
    2
    >>> fizz_buzz(79)
    3
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            count += str(i).count('7')
    return count
```

This code defines the `fizz_buzz` function as required. It iterates through numbers less than `n`, checks if they are divisible by 11 or 13, and counts the occurrences of the digit '7' in those numbers. The function then returns this count.

2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `fizz_buzz` uses only built-in Python functionality, so there is no need to specify any packages in a `requirements.txt` file. 

However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for the sake of completeness or future expansion, you can create an empty file or include a comment indicating that no external packages are required.

Here is how you can create an empty `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external packages required for this project
```

Or simply leave it empty:

```
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any third-party libraries.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `fizz_buzz` uses only built-in Python functionality, so there is no need to specify any packages in a `requirements.txt` file. 
However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for the sake of completeness or future expansion, you can create an empty file or include a comment indicating that no external packages are required.
Here is how you can create an empty `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external packages required for this project
```
Or simply leave it empty:
```
```
This indicates that the project does not rely on any third-party libraries. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I agree with the Programmer's assessment. The `fizz_buzz` function in `main.py` does not require any external libraries or packages, as it solely relies on Python's built-in capabilities. Therefore, a `requirements.txt` file is not necessary for this project. However, for the sake of completeness and future-proofing, we can create a `requirements.txt` file with a comment indicating that no external packages are required. Here is how it can be done:

```plaintext

Alternatively, you can leave the `requirements.txt` file completely empty to indicate that there are no dependencies. This approach ensures clarity and readiness for any future developments that might introduce dependencies.
