Given the task at hand, which involves writing a piece of software code to solve a specific problem, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a functional piece of software, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts on this?

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To solve the task, we need to write a function `words_in_sentence` that takes a sentence as input and returns a string containing words whose lengths are prime numbers. We will implement this function in a single Python file, `main.py`. Since the task explicitly states not to implement a GUI, we will focus solely on the logic required to solve the problem.

Here's the plan for the function:

1. **Prime Number Check**: We need a helper function to check if a number is prime.
2. **Sentence Processing**: Split the sentence into words, check the length of each word, and determine if the length is a prime number.
3. **Result Construction**: Collect words with prime lengths and return them as a space-separated string.

Now, let's implement the code in `main.py`.

5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,
    whose lengths are prime numbers,

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

# Prime Length Words Filter

This software module provides a function to filter words in a sentence based on the length of the words being prime numbers. It is designed to be simple and efficient, with no external dependencies required.

## Main Functionality

The main function of this software is `words_in_sentence(sentence)`, which takes a sentence as input and returns a string containing the words from the original sentence whose lengths are prime numbers. The order of the words in the returned string is the same as in the original sentence.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage:
print(words_in_sentence("This is a test"))  # Output: "is"
print(words_in_sentence("lets go for swimming"))  # Output: "go for"
```

## Installation

No external dependencies are required for this software. It is implemented purely in Python, and you can run it in any standard Python environment.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change your directory to where the `main.py` file is located.

    ```bash
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

3. **Run the Code**: You can run the `main.py` file directly using Python to test the function with your own sentences.

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. **Integrate into Your Project**: If you want to use the `words_in_sentence` function in your own project, simply copy the function and the helper function `is_prime` into your codebase.

## Understanding the Code

- **`is_prime(n)`**: This helper function checks if a given number `n` is a prime number. It returns `True` if `n` is prime and `False` otherwise.

- **`words_in_sentence(sentence)`**: This function splits the input sentence into words, checks the length of each word, and filters out the words whose lengths are prime numbers. It then joins these words back into a single string and returns it.

## Conclusion

This software provides a straightforward solution to filter words based on prime number lengths. It is easy to integrate and use in various Python projects where such functionality is required.
