Considering the task at hand, which involves writing a function to convert integers to Roman numerals, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a software tool or function, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. An application can effectively handle the logic and computation needed for this task. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" is indeed the most suitable product modality for this task, as it involves implementing a software function to perform a specific computation. This aligns well with the nature of applications, which are designed to execute code and perform tasks programmatically. Let's proceed with this modality.

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `int_to_mini_roman` that converts a given integer to its Roman numeral equivalent in lowercase. The function should handle numbers from 1 to 1000.

### Core Function:
- **int_to_mini_roman(number):** This function will take an integer as input and return its Roman numeral representation in lowercase.

Now, let's proceed with the implementation of the function in the `main.py` file.

```python

    >>> int_to_mini_roman(152) == 'clii'
    >>> int_to_mini_roman(426) == 'cdxxvi'
    """
    roman_numerals = [
        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),
        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),
        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')
    ]
    
    result = []
    for (arabic, roman) in roman_numerals:
        while number >= arabic:
            result.append(roman)
            number -= arabic
    
    return ''.join(result).lower()

# Example usage:
# print(int_to_mini_roman(19))  # Output: 'xix'
# print(int_to_mini_roman(152)) # Output: 'clii'
# print(int_to_mini_roman(426)) # Output: 'cdxxvi'
```

This code defines the `int_to_mini_roman` function, which uses a list of tuples to map integers to their corresponding Roman numeral symbols. It iterates over this list, subtracting the integer value from the input number and appending the Roman numeral to the result until the number is reduced to zero. The result is then joined into a string and converted to lowercase before being returned.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required since it only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed for the project to run properly.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

# int_to_mini_roman User Manual

## Introduction

The `int_to_mini_roman` function is a simple Python utility that converts a given positive integer into its Roman numeral equivalent, represented in lowercase. This function is particularly useful for applications that require the representation of numbers in Roman numeral format for display or processing purposes.

## Main Functionality

- **Function Name**: `int_to_mini_roman`
- **Input**: A positive integer `number` where 1 <= number <= 1000.
- **Output**: A string representing the Roman numeral equivalent of the input number, in lowercase.

### Examples

- `int_to_mini_roman(19)` returns `'xix'`
- `int_to_mini_roman(152)` returns `'clii'`
- `int_to_mini_roman(426)` returns `'cdxxvi'`

## Installation

To use the `int_to_mini_roman` function, you need to have Python installed on your system. This function does not require any external libraries, so there are no additional dependencies to install.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or download the `main.py` file containing the `int_to_mini_roman` function.

## Usage

1. **Open a Python environment**: You can use any Python IDE or a simple command line interface.

2. **Import the function**: If the function is in a separate file, ensure you import it correctly.

   ```python
   from main import int_to_mini_roman
   ```

3. **Call the function**: Pass the desired integer to the function and capture the output.

   ```python
   roman_numeral = int_to_mini_roman(152)
   print(roman_numeral)  # Output: clii
   ```

## Documentation

The function is self-contained and does not have additional documentation requirements. The code is straightforward and includes comments to aid understanding.

For further assistance or inquiries, please contact our support team or refer to the comments within the code for guidance on how the conversion logic is implemented.
