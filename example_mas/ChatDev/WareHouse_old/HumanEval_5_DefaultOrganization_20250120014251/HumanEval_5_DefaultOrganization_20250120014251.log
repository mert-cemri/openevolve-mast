The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

To complete the task, we need to implement the `intersperse` function as described in the task. Since the task specifically instructs not to implement a GUI and only to write the necessary code, we will focus on implementing the function in Python without any additional files or GUI components.

Let's break down the task:

1. **Function Purpose**: The `intersperse` function takes a list of integers (`numbers`) and an integer (`delimeter`). It returns a new list where the `delimeter` is inserted between every two consecutive elements of the input list.

2. **Example**:
   - Input: `intersperse([], 4)` should return `[]`.
   - Input: `intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)` should return `[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]`.

3. **Implementation Plan**:
   - Check if the input list is empty. If it is, return an empty list.
   - Iterate through the list and insert the `delimeter` between elements.
   - Return the modified list.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python
'''
This module contains the implementation of the intersperse function which inserts a delimiter between every two consecutive elements of a list.
'''

from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers`
    >>> intersperse([], 4)
    []
    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)
    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
    """
    if not numbers:
        return []
    
    result = []
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        result.append(numbers[i])
        result.append(delimeter)
    result.append(numbers[-1])
    
    return result
```

This code implements the `intersperse` function as specified. It handles the edge case of an empty list and correctly inserts the delimiter between each pair of consecutive elements in the list.

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required beyond the standard Python library. The function `intersperse` only uses basic Python data structures and types, which do not require any additional packages. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed for this project.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Intersperse Function User Manual

Welcome to the user manual for the `intersperse` function. This document will guide you through the main functionalities of the software, how to set up the environment, and how to use the function effectively.

## Overview

The `intersperse` function is a simple utility designed to insert a specified delimiter between every two consecutive elements of a list of integers. This function is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to format a list with a consistent separator, such as preparing data for output or processing.

## Main Functionality

### `intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]`

- **Purpose**: Inserts a specified delimiter between every two consecutive elements of the input list `numbers`.
- **Parameters**:
  - `numbers`: A list of integers that you want to intersperse with a delimiter.
  - `delimeter`: An integer that will be inserted between each pair of consecutive elements in the list.
- **Returns**: A new list with the delimiter inserted between each pair of consecutive elements.

#### Example Usage

```python
>>> intersperse([], 4)
[]
>>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)
[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
```

## Installation

The `intersperse` function does not require any external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. Therefore, you do not need to install any additional packages to use this function.

### Quick Start

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or Download the Code**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the `intersperse` function.

3. **Run the Function**: You can execute the function directly in a Python environment or script by importing it from the `main.py` file.

## Usage

To use the `intersperse` function, follow these steps:

- **Purpose**: Inserts a specified delimiter between every two consecutive elements of the input list `numbers`.
- **Parameters**:
  - `numbers`: A list of integers that you want to intersperse with a delimiter.
  - `delimeter`: An integer that will be inserted between each pair of consecutive elements in the list.
- **Returns**: A new list with the delimiter inserted between each pair of consecutive elements.

#### Example Usage

```python
>>> intersperse([], 4)
[]
>>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)
[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
```
