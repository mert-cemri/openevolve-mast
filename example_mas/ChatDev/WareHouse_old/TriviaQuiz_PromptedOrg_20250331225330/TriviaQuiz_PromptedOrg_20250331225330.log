Considering the customer's requirement for an interactive trivia quiz program that tracks user input, scores, and configurable question banks, the most suitable product modality seems to be an Application.

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:

1. Class: Question
   - Purpose: Represents a single quiz question, including the question text, possible answers, correct answer, and question type (multiple-choice or short-answer).

2. Class: Quiz
   - Purpose: Manages the quiz flow, including presenting questions, collecting user answers, evaluating correctness, tracking score, and displaying results.

3. Function: load_questions()
   - Purpose: Loads and returns a configurable set of questions from a predefined question bank.

4. Function: main()
   - Purpose: Entry point of the application, initializes the quiz, and manages user interaction.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The highest priority issue identified is related to input validation logic for multiple-choice questions. Currently, the code accepts numeric input or exact text matching, but it does not handle case-insensitive matching robustly for textual inputs, potentially causing valid answers to be rejected unnecessarily.

Specifically, in `quiz.py`, the following logic is problematic:

```python
elif answer.lower().strip() in [opt.lower() for opt in question.options]:
    break
```

This logic correctly checks if the user's textual answer matches any option in a case-insensitive manner. However, after this check passes, the user's original input (`answer`) is used directly without normalizing it to the exact option text. This can lead to inconsistencies when displaying results or checking correctness later.

### Suggestion for Revision:

Modify the input validation logic to normalize the user's textual answer to the exact option text from the provided options. Replace the current validation block in `quiz.py`:

```python
if question.options:
    # Validate numeric answer and convert to option text if applicable
    while True:
        if answer.isdigit() and 1 <= int(answer) <= len(question.options):
            answer = question.options[int(answer) - 1]
            break
        elif answer.lower().strip() in [opt.lower() for opt in question.options]:
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter the option number or exact option text.")
            answer = input("Your answer: ").strip()
```

with the improved version:

```python
if question.options:
    # Validate numeric answer and convert to option text if applicable
    while True:
        if answer.isdigit() and 1 <= int(answer) <= len(question.options):
            answer = question.options[int(answer) - 1]
            break
        else:
            matched_options = [opt for opt in question.options if opt.lower() == answer.lower().strip()]
            if matched_options:
                answer = matched_options[0]  # Normalize to exact option text
                break
            else:
                print("Invalid input. Please enter the option number or exact option text.")
                answer = input("Your answer: ").strip()
```

### Explanation:

This revision ensures that when a user enters a textual answer, the program normalizes it to the exact option text, preserving consistency in displaying results and checking correctness. It enhances robustness and user-friendliness by accepting case-insensitive textual answers and converting them to the exact option text.

After applying this fix, the code will fully comply with the user's requirements and ChatDev's regulations.

If no other issues are found after this correction, the code can be considered ready for deployment.

Currently, the code accepts numeric input or exact text matching, but it does not handle case-insensitive matching robustly for textual inputs, potentially causing valid answers to be rejected unnecessarily.\n\nSpecifically, in quiz.py, the following logic is problematic:\n\npython\nelif answer.lower().strip() in [opt.lower() for opt in question.options]:\n    break\n\n\nThis logic correctly checks if the user\'s textual answer matches any option in a case-insensitive manner. However, after this check passes, the user\'s original input (answer) is used directly without normalizing it to the exact option text. This can lead to inconsistencies when displaying results or checking correctness later.\n\n### Suggestion for Revision:\n\nModify the input validation logic to normalize the user\'s textual answer to the exact option text from the provided options. Replace the current validation block in quiz.py:\n\npython\nif question.options:\n    # Validate numeric answer and convert to option text if applicable\n    while True:\n        if answer.isdigit() and 1 &lt;= int(answer) &lt;= len(question.options):\n            answer = question.options[int(answer) - 1]\n            break\n        elif answer.lower().strip() in [opt.lower() for opt in question.options]:\n            break\n        else:\n            print("Invalid input. Please enter the option number or exact option text.")\n            answer = input("Your answer: ").strip()\n\n\nwith the improved version:\n\npython\nif question.options:\n    # Validate numeric answer and convert to option text if applicable\n    while True:\n        if answer.isdigit() and 1 &lt;= int(answer) &lt;= len(question.options):\n            answer = question.options[int(answer) - 1]\n            break\n        else:\n            matched_options = [opt for opt in question.options if opt.lower() == answer.lower().strip()]\n            if matched_options:\n                answer = matched_options[0]  # Normalize to exact option text\n                break\n            else:\n                print("Invalid input. Please enter the option number or exact option text.")\n                answer = input("Your answer: ").strip()\n\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThis revision ensures that when a user enters a textual answer, the program normalizes it to the exact option text, preserving consistency in displaying results and checking correctness. It enhances robustness and user-friendliness by accepting case-insensitive textual answers and converting them to the exact option text.\n\nAfter applying this fix, the code will fully comply with the user\'s requirements and ChatDev\'s regulations.\n\nIf no other issues are found after this correction, the code can be considered ready for deployment.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"The highest priority issue identified is related to input validation logic for multiple-choice questions. Currently, the code accepts numeric input or exact text matching, but it does not handle case-insensitive matching robustly for textual inputs, potentially causing valid answers to be rejected unnecessarily.

Specifically, in `quiz.py`, the following logic is problematic:

```python
elif answer.lower().strip() in [opt.lower() for opt in question.options]:
    break
```

This logic correctly checks if the user's textual answer matches any option in a case-insensitive manner. However, after this check passes, the user's original input (`answer`) is used directly without normalizing it to the exact option text. This can lead to inconsistencies when displaying results or checking correctness later.

### Suggestion for Revision:

Modify the input validation logic to normalize the user's textual answer to the exact option text from the provided options. Replace the current validation block in `quiz.py`:

```python
if question.options:
    # Validate numeric answer and convert to option text if applicable
    while True:
        if answer.isdigit() and 1 <= int(answer) <= len(question.options):
            answer = question.options[int(answer) - 1]
            break
        elif answer.lower().strip() in [opt.lower() for opt in question.options]:
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter the option number or exact option text.")
            answer = input("Your answer: ").strip()
```

with the improved version:

```python
if question.options:
    # Validate numeric answer and convert to option text if applicable
    while True:
        if answer.isdigit() and 1 <= int(answer) <= len(question.options):
            answer = question.options[int(answer) - 1]
            break
        else:
            matched_options = [opt for opt in question.options if opt.lower() == answer.lower().strip()]
            if matched_options:
                answer = matched_options[0]  # Normalize to exact option text
                break
            else:
                print("Invalid input. Please enter the option number or exact option text.")
                answer = input("Your answer: ").strip()
```

### Explanation:

This revision ensures that when a user enters a textual answer, the program normalizes it to the exact option text, preserving consistency in displaying results and checking correctness. It enhances robustness and user-friendliness by accepting case-insensitive textual answers and converting them to the exact option text.

After applying this fix, the code will fully comply with the user's requirements and ChatDev's regulations.

If no other issues are found after this correction, the code can be considered ready for deployment."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Currently, the code accepts numeric input or exact text matching, but it does not handle case-insensitive matching robustly for textual inputs, potentially causing valid answers to be rejected unnecessarily.\n\nSpecifically, in quiz.py, the following logic is problematic:\n\npython\nelif answer.lower().strip() in [opt.lower() for opt in question.options]:\n    break\n\n\nThis logic correctly checks if the user\'s textual answer matches any option in a case-insensitive manner. However, after this check passes, the user\'s original input (answer) is used directly without normalizing it to the exact option text. This can lead to inconsistencies when displaying results or checking correctness later.\n\n### Suggestion for Revision:\n\nModify the input validation logic to normalize the user\'s textual answer to the exact option text from the provided options. Replace the current validation block in quiz.py:\n\npython\nif question.options:\n    # Validate numeric answer and convert to option text if applicable\n    while True:\n        if answer.isdigit() and 1 &lt;= int(answer) &lt;= len(question.options):\n            answer = question.options[int(answer) - 1]\n            break\n        elif answer.lower().strip() in [opt.lower() for opt in question.options]:\n            break\n        else:\n            print("Invalid input. Please enter the option number or exact option text.")\n            answer = input("Your answer: ").strip()\n\n\nwith the improved version:\n\npython\nif question.options:\n    # Validate numeric answer and convert to option text if applicable\n    while True:\n        if answer.isdigit() and 1 &lt;= int(answer) &lt;= len(question.options):\n            answer = question.options[int(answer) - 1]\n            break\n        else:\n            matched_options = [opt for opt in question.options if opt.lower() == answer.lower().strip()]\n            if matched_options:\n                answer = matched_options[0]  # Normalize to exact option text\n                break\n            else:\n                print("Invalid input. Please enter the option number or exact option text.")\n                answer = input("Your answer: ").strip()\n\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThis revision ensures that when a user enters a textual answer, the program normalizes it to the exact option text, preserving consistency in displaying results and checking correctness. It enhances robustness and user-friendliness by accepting case-insensitive textual answers and converting them to the exact option text.\n\nAfter applying this fix, the code will fully comply with the user\'s requirements and ChatDev\'s regulations.\n\nIf no other issues are found after this correction, the code can be considered ready for deployment.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
