Given the task at hand, which involves writing and correcting a piece of software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a functional piece of code, which aligns with the capabilities of an application that can execute and demonstrate the software's functionality. What are your thoughts on this?

To solve the task, we need to implement the `correct_bracketing` function in Python. The function should check if every opening bracket "<" has a corresponding closing bracket ">". We will focus on implementing the function correctly without adding any GUI components, as the task specifically asks for the necessary code only.

Let's break down the task:

1. **Function Name**: `correct_bracketing`
2. **Input**: A string consisting of "<" and ">".
3. **Output**: A boolean indicating whether the brackets are correctly matched.
4. **Logic**: Use a counter to track unmatched opening brackets. Increment the counter for each "<" and decrement for each ">", ensuring the counter never goes negative. At the end, the counter should be zero for the brackets to be correctly matched.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains the implementation of the correct_bracketing function.

def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """ brackets is a string of "<" and ">".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("<")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("<>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
    False
    """
    balance = 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '>':
            balance -= 1
        # If balance goes negative, there are more closing brackets than opening
        if balance < 0:
            return False
    # If balance is zero, all opening brackets have matching closing brackets
    return balance == 0
```

This code implements the `correct_bracketing` function as described. It uses a simple counter to ensure that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and it returns `True` if the brackets are correctly matched, otherwise `False`.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            

def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """ brackets is a string of "<" and ">".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("<")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("<>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
    False
    """
.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

For the given code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `correct_bracketing` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. Here is how it would look:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not require any additional packages beyond the standard Python library to run properly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
