Considering the task involves writing a piece of software code to solve a specific problem, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to focus on implementing the necessary logic and ensuring the code functions correctly without any additional presentation layers. What are your thoughts on this?

To address the customer's task, we need to implement a function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` that determines whether a given number `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. The task explicitly states not to implement a GUI, so we will focus solely on the logic required for this function.

### Core Function

- **Function: `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)`**
  - **Purpose**: To check if a given integer `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers.
  - **Logic**: 
    - A positive even number is any number that is divisible by 2 and greater than 0.
    - The smallest sum of four positive even numbers is 8 (i.e., 2 + 2 + 2 + 2).
    - Therefore, for any number less than 8, the function should return `False`.
    - For numbers 8 and above, the function should return `True` if the number is even, as it can be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

#### main.py

```python
'''

This module contains a function to evaluate whether a given number can be written as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers.

'''

def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The number to evaluate.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if n can be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers, False otherwise.
    
    Example:
    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True
    """
    # The smallest sum of four positive even numbers is 8 (2 + 2 + 2 + 2).
    # Therefore, n must be at least 8 and even to be expressed as such a sum.
    return n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0
```

This code provides the necessary logic to determine if a number can be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers. It checks if the number is at least 8 and even, which are the conditions required for the sum of four positive even numbers.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".
