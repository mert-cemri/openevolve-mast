Given the task, the product modality should focus on solving a programming problem rather than presenting information visually or through documents. The task requires writing and fixing code, which aligns with the "Application" modality, as it involves implementing a software tool. What are your thoughts on this?

To solve the task, we need to implement a function that checks if three given sides can form a right-angled triangle. The function will use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Function Definition**: We will define the function `right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)` that takes three arguments representing the sides of a triangle.

2. **Check for Right-Angle**: We will check if the given sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. Since the sides can be given in any order, we need to check all permutations to determine if any configuration forms a right-angled triangle.

3. **Return Result**: The function will return `True` if any permutation of the sides forms a right-angled triangle, otherwise it will return `False`.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

main.py

```python
'''
Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
90 degree.
Example:
right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
'''

def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    # Sort the sides to ensure the largest is considered as the hypotenuse
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    # Check if the square of the largest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides
    return sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2
```

This code defines the function `right_angle_triangle` which checks if the given sides can form a right-angled triangle by sorting the sides and applying the Pythagorean theorem. The function returns `True` if the condition is met, otherwise `False`.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `right_angle_triangle` only uses basic Python operations and does not rely on any additional libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty or not needed for this specific project.

If you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for documentation purposes, you can create an empty file:

```
# requirements.txt

# No external dependencies required for this project
```

This indicates that the project does not require any additional Python packages to run.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `right_angle_triangle` only uses basic Python operations and does not rely on any additional libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty or not needed for this specific project.
If you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for documentation purposes, you can create an empty file:
```
# requirements.txt
# No external dependencies required for this project
```
This indicates that the project does not require any additional Python packages to run. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Right Angle Triangle Checker

This software provides a simple function to determine if three given side lengths can form a right-angled triangle. It is implemented in Python and does not require any external dependencies.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this software is encapsulated in the `right_angle_triangle` function. This function takes three arguments, representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and returns a boolean value:

- `True` if the sides form a right-angled triangle.
- `False` otherwise.

### Function Definition

```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''
    # Sort the sides to ensure the largest is considered as the hypotenuse
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    # Check if the square of the largest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides
    return sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external libraries or dependencies. It is implemented in pure Python. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Python Installation**: If you do not have Python installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If the code is hosted in a repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

## Usage

To use the `right_angle_triangle` function, you can directly call it from a Python script or an interactive Python session. Here is an example of how to use it:

```python
# Example usage of the right_angle_triangle function
print(right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5))  # Output: True
print(right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3))  # Output: False
```

## Documentation

This function uses the Pythagorean theorem to determine if the given sides can form a right-angled triangle. It sorts the sides to ensure the largest is considered the hypotenuse and checks if the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
