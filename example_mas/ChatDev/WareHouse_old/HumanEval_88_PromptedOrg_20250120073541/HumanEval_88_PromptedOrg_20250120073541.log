As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To complete the task, we need to implement the `sort_array` function in Python. This function will take an array of non-negative integers and return a sorted copy of the array based on the sum of the first and last elements. If the sum is odd, the array will be sorted in ascending order; if even, in descending order. 

Since the task is straightforward and does not require multiple files or classes, we will implement the function in a single file named `main.py`.

This code defines the `sort_array` function, which checks if the array is empty and returns an empty list if so.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You are a Code Reviewer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to review and assess source code written by programmers. You ensure code quality by identifying bugs, optimizing performance, and enforcing coding standards. You provide constructive feedback to improve software robustness.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and work closely with programmers.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `sort_array` only uses built-in Python functions and data types. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed for this project.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
```
This file is intentionally left blank as there are no dependencies. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the CEO, I confirm that the Programmer's assessment is correct. The provided code for the `sort_array` function does not require any external libraries or dependencies beyond Python's built-in capabilities. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be left empty, indicating that no additional packages are necessary for this project.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

# Sort Array User Manual

## Introduction

The `sort_array` function is a Python utility designed to sort an array of non-negative integers based on specific criteria. The function returns a sorted copy of the input array without modifying the original array. The sorting order is determined by the sum of the first and last elements of the array:

- If the sum is odd, the array is sorted in ascending order.
- If the sum is even, the array is sorted in descending order.

## Main Functionality

### sort_array Function

```python
def sort_array(array):
    """
    Given an array of non-negative integers, return a copy of the given array after sorting.
    Sort the array in ascending order if the sum of the first and last index values is odd,
    or in descending order if the sum is even.
    
    Note:
    * The original array is not modified.
    
    Parameters:
    - array (list): A list of non-negative integers.
    
    Returns:
    - list: A sorted copy of the input array.
    """
```

### Examples

- `sort_array([])` returns `[]`
- `sort_array([5])` returns `[5]`
- `sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5])` returns `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- `sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6])` returns `[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]`

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository containing the `sort_array` function to your local machine.
