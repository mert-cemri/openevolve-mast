Task: "Develop a classic Sudoku puzzle game that uses a 9x9 grid. Each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain the digits 1 through 9 exactly once. The program should allow the player to input values for specific cells, check for mistakes, and confirm when the puzzle is completed.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

### Step 1: Planning the Architecture

We will create the following Python files:

1. **main.py**: Entry point of the application, handles user interaction.
2. **sudoku.py**: Contains the Sudoku class, responsible for puzzle logic, validation, and checking completion.
3. **puzzle_generator.py**: Generates Sudoku puzzles.

---

### Core Classes and Functions:

#### sudoku.py
- **class Sudoku**
  - `__init__(self, puzzle)`: Initializes the Sudoku puzzle.
  - `is_valid_move(self, row, col, num)`: Checks if placing a number is valid.
  - `is_completed(self)`: Checks if the puzzle is completed correctly.
  - `display(self)`: Prints the current state of the puzzle.
  - `set_value(self, row, col, num)`: Sets a value in the puzzle.

#### puzzle_generator.py
- **generate_puzzle()**: Generates and returns a Sudoku puzzle.

---

### Step 2: Implementing the Files

main.py

```python
'''

            row = int(input("Enter row (1-9): ")) - 1
            col = int(input("Enter column (1-9): ")) - 1
            num = int(input("Enter number (1-9): "))

Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation allows the player to overwrite cells that were pre-filled by the puzzle generator, which violates the standard Sudoku gameplay rules. Players should only be allowed to input values into empty cells (cells initially set to zero).

Suggestions on Revision:

1. Modify the Sudoku class to store the initial puzzle state separately, allowing the program to distinguish between pre-filled cells and user-input cells.

2. Implement a method to check if a cell is editable (initially empty) before allowing the user to set a value.

3. Update the `set_value` method to prevent overwriting pre-filled cells.

Example revision for sudoku.py:

```python
class Sudoku:
    def __init__(self, puzzle):
        self.initial_grid = [row[:] for row in puzzle]  # Store initial puzzle state
        self.grid = [row[:] for row in puzzle]

    def is_cell_editable(self, row, col):
        # Check if the cell was initially empty
        return self.initial_grid[row][col] == 0

    def set_value(self, row, col, num):
        if self.is_cell_editable(row, col):
            self.grid[row][col] = num
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

Example revision for main.py (to handle non-editable cells):

```python
if game.is_valid_move(row, col, num):
    if not game.set_value(row, col, num):
        print("Cannot change pre-filled cells! Try again.")
else:
    print("Invalid move! Try again.")
```

This ensures adherence to Sudoku rules and improves the user experience by clearly communicating the reason for invalid moves.

Comments on Codes:
"Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation allows the player to overwrite cells that were pre-filled by the puzzle generator, which violates the standard Sudoku gameplay rules. Players should only be allowed to input values into empty cells (cells initially set to zero).

Suggestions on Revision:

1. Modify the Sudoku class to store the initial puzzle state separately, allowing the program to distinguish between pre-filled cells and user-input cells.

2. Implement a method to check if a cell is editable (initially empty) before allowing the user to set a value.

3. Update the `set_value` method to prevent overwriting pre-filled cells.

Example revision for sudoku.py:

```python
class Sudoku:
    def __init__(self, puzzle):
        self.initial_grid = [row[:] for row in puzzle]  # Store initial puzzle state
        self.grid = [row[:] for row in puzzle]

    def is_cell_editable(self, row, col):
        # Check if the cell was initially empty
        return self.initial_grid[row][col] == 0

    def set_value(self, row, col, num):
        if self.is_cell_editable(row, col):
            self.grid[row][col] = num
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

Example revision for main.py (to handle non-editable cells):

```python
if game.is_valid_move(row, col, num):
    if not game.set_value(row, col, num):
        print("Cannot change pre-filled cells! Try again.")
else:
    print("Invalid move! Try again.")
```

This ensures adherence to Sudoku rules and improves the user experience by clearly communicating the reason for invalid moves."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation of the `is_completed()` method in `sudoku.py` incorrectly checks puzzle completion by temporarily removing each number and validating it again, which is inefficient and logically incorrect. Specifically, it calls `is_valid_move_for_completion()` for every filled cell, causing redundant checks and potential false negatives.

Suggestion for Revision:

Replace the current `is_completed()` method with a simpler and more efficient logic that directly checks if all cells are filled (no zeros) and then validates each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid exactly once. Here is a suggested implementation:

```python
def is_completed(self):
    # Check if all cells are filled
    for row in self.grid:
        if 0 in row:
            return False

    # Check rows and columns
    for i in range(9):
        if len(set(self.grid[i])) != 9 or len(set(self.grid[j][i] for j in range(9))) != 9:
            return False

    # Check 3x3 subgrids
    for start_row in range(0, 9, 3):
        for start_col in range(0, 9, 3):
            nums = set()
            for i in range(3):
                for j in range(3):
                    nums.add(self.grid[start_row + i][start_col + j])
            if len(nums) != 9:
                return False

    return True
```

This implementation ensures correctness, readability, and efficiency by directly verifying the Sudoku rules without redundant temporary modifications.

Comments on Codes:
"Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation of the `is_completed()` method in `sudoku.py` incorrectly checks puzzle completion by temporarily removing each number and validating it again, which is inefficient and logically incorrect. Specifically, it calls `is_valid_move_for_completion()` for every filled cell, causing redundant checks and potential false negatives.

Suggestion for Revision:

Replace the current `is_completed()` method with a simpler and more efficient logic that directly checks if all cells are filled (no zeros) and then validates each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid exactly once. Here is a suggested implementation:

```python
def is_completed(self):
    # Check if all cells are filled
    for row in self.grid:
        if 0 in row:
            return False

    # Check rows and columns

This implementation ensures correctness, readability, and efficiency by directly verifying the Sudoku rules without redundant temporary modifications."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Here is a suggested implementation:\n\npython\ndef is_completed(self):\n    # Check if all cells are filled\n    for row in self.grid:\n        if 0 in row:\n            return False\n\n    # Check rows and columns\n    for i in range(9):\n        if len(set(self.grid[i])) != 9 or len(set(self.grid[j][i] for j in range(9))) != 9:\n            return False\n\n    # Check 3x3 subgrids\n    for start_row in range(0, 9, 3):\n        for start_col in range(0, 9, 3):\n            nums = set()\n            for i in range(3):\n                for j in range(3):\n                    nums.add(self.grid[start_row + i][start_col + j])\n            if len(nums) != 9:\n                return False\n\n    return True\n\n\nThis implementation ensures correctness, readability, and efficiency by directly verifying the Sudoku rules without redundant temporary modifications.'} |

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a classic Sudoku puzzle game that uses a 9x9 grid. Each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain the digits 1 through 9 exactly once. The program should allow the player to input values for specific cells, check for mistakes, and confirm when the puzzle is completed..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation does not provide a feature for the player to explicitly check for mistakes made during gameplay. According to the user's requirement, the program should allow the player to input values for specific cells, check for mistakes, and confirm when the puzzle is completed. However, the current implementation only checks if a move is valid at the moment of input, but does not provide a separate functionality for the player to verify the correctness of the entire puzzle at any time during gameplay.

Suggestion for Revision:

Add a method `check_for_mistakes()` in the `Sudoku` class to explicitly verify the current state of the puzzle against Sudoku rules, highlighting incorrect entries. Additionally, provide an option in the main game loop for the player to invoke this method at any time to check their progress.

Example implementation:

In sudoku.py, add:
```python
def check_for_mistakes(self):
    mistakes = []
    for row in range(9):
        for col in range(9):
            num = self.grid[row][col]
            if num != 0:
                self.grid[row][col] = 0  # Temporarily remove the number to check validity
                if not self.is_valid_move(row, col, num):
                    mistakes.append((row, col))
                self.grid[row][col] = num  # Restore the number
    return mistakes
```

In main.py, modify the main loop to include an option for checking mistakes:
```python
while not game.is_completed():
    game.display()
    action = input("Enter 'c' to check mistakes or 'p' to play: ").lower()
    if action == 'c':
        mistakes = game.check_for_mistakes()
        if mistakes:
            print("Mistakes found at positions:")
            for row, col in mistakes:
                print(f"Row {row + 1}, Column {col + 1}")
        else:
            print("No mistakes found. Keep going!")
        continue
    elif action == 'p':
        try:
            row = int(input("Enter row (1-9): ")) - 1
            col = int(input("Enter column (1-9): ")) - 1
            num = int(input("Enter number (1-9): "))
            if not game.is_cell_editable(row, col):
                print("Cannot change pre-filled cells! Try again.")
                continue
            if game.is_valid_move(row, col, num):
                game.set_value(row, col, num)
            else:
                print("Invalid move! Try again.")
        except (ValueError, IndexError):
            print("Invalid input! Please enter numbers between 1 and 9.")
    else:
        print("Invalid action! Please enter 'c' or 'p'.")
```

This revision ensures the software fully meets the user's requirement by allowing explicit checking for mistakes during gameplay.

Comments on Codes:
"Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation does not provide a feature for the player to explicitly check for mistakes made during gameplay. According to the user's requirement, the program should allow the player to input values for specific cells, check for mistakes, and confirm when the puzzle is completed. However, the current implementation only checks if a move is valid at the moment of input, but does not provide a separate functionality for the player to verify the correctness of the entire puzzle at any time during gameplay.

Suggestion for Revision:

Add a method `check_for_mistakes()` in the `Sudoku` class to explicitly verify the current state of the puzzle against Sudoku rules, highlighting incorrect entries. Additionally, provide an option in the main game loop for the player to invoke this method at any time to check their progress.

Example implementation:

In sudoku.py, add:
```python
def check_for_mistakes(self):
    mistakes = []
    for row in range(9):
        for col in range(9):
            num = self.grid[row][col]
            if num != 0:
                self.grid[row][col] = 0  # Temporarily remove the number to check validity
                if not self.is_valid_move(row, col, num):
                    mistakes.append((row, col))
                self.grid[row][col] = num  # Restore the number
    return mistakes
```

In main.py, modify the main loop to include an option for checking mistakes:
```python
while not game.is_completed():
    game.display()
    action = input("Enter 'c' to check mistakes or 'p' to play: ").lower()
    if action == 'c':
        mistakes = game.check_for_mistakes()
        if mistakes:
            print("Mistakes found at positions:")
            for row, col in mistakes:
                print(f"Row {row + 1}, Column {col + 1}")
        else:
            print("No mistakes found. Keep going!")
        continue
    elif action == 'p':
        try:
            row = int(input("Enter row (1-9): ")) - 1
            col = int(input("Enter column (1-9): ")) - 1
            num = int(input("Enter number (1-9): "))
            if not game.is_cell_editable(row, col):
                print("Cannot change pre-filled cells! Try again.")
                continue
            if game.is_valid_move(row, col, num):
                game.set_value(row, col, num)
            else:
                print("Invalid move! Try again.")
        except (ValueError, IndexError):
            print("Invalid input! Please enter numbers between 1 and 9.")
    else:
        print("Invalid action! Please enter 'c' or 'p'.")

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

## 🚀 How to Play

### Starting the Game

Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Gameplay Instructions

1. **View the Puzzle:**
   - The Sudoku puzzle will be displayed in the terminal, with empty cells represented by dots (`.`).

2. **Choose an Action:**
   - You will be prompted to choose an action:
     - Enter `'p'` to play (input a number into the grid).
     - Enter `'c'` to check for mistakes.

3. **Playing the Game:**
   - If you choose `'p'`, you will be prompted to enter:
     - **Row number (1-9)**: The row where you want to place your number.
     - **Column number (1-9)**: The column where you want to place your number.
     - **Number (1-9)**: The digit you want to place in the selected cell.
   - The game will validate your move:
     - If the move is valid, the number will be placed in the cell.
     - If the move is invalid (violates Sudoku rules or attempts to modify a pre-filled cell), you will be notified and prompted to try again.

4. **Checking for Mistakes:**
   - If you choose `'c'`, the game will explicitly check your current puzzle state for mistakes.
   - If mistakes are found, the game will display the positions (row and column) of incorrect entries.
   - If no mistakes are found, you will be encouraged to continue playing.

5. **Completing the Puzzle:**
   - Continue filling in numbers until the puzzle is complete.
   - Once completed successfully, the game will congratulate you and display the final solved puzzle.
