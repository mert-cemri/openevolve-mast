Given the task at hand, which involves writing a function to convert integers to Roman numerals, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task is focused on implementing a specific piece of software code, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" is indeed the most suitable product modality for this task, as it involves writing and testing a specific piece of software code. This aligns well with the nature of an application, which is designed to implement and execute code.

To address the user's task, we need to implement a function that converts an integer to its Roman numeral equivalent in lowercase. The task specifies that we should not implement a GUI, so we will focus solely on the core functionality. Here's the plan:

### Core Function
- **Function Name**: `int_to_mini_roman`
- **Purpose**: Convert a given integer (1 <= number <= 1000) to its Roman numeral representation in lowercase.

### Implementation Steps
1. Define a mapping of integer values to their corresponding Roman numeral symbols.
2. Iterate over the mapping, subtracting values from the input number and appending the corresponding symbols to the result string.
3. Return the result string in lowercase.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),
        (1, 'I')
    ]
    
    result = []
    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:
        while number >= value:
            result.append(symbol)
            number -= value

# print(int_to_mini_roman(152)) # Output: 'clii'
# print(int_to_mini_roman(426)) # Output: 'cdxxvi'
```

This code defines the `int_to_mini_roman` function, which converts an integer to its Roman numeral equivalent in lowercase. The function uses a list of tuples to map integer values to Roman numeral symbols and constructs the result by iterating over this mapping.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `int_to_mini_roman` only uses standard Python features and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file can be left empty or omitted entirely. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that there are no additional packages needed for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `int_to_mini_roman` only uses standard Python features and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file can be left empty or omitted entirely. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that there are no additional packages needed for the project to run properly. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Mini Roman Numeral Converter

This software provides a function to convert a positive integer into its Roman numeral equivalent, returned as a lowercase string. The function is designed to handle numbers within the range of 1 to 1000.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `int_to_mini_roman(number)`. This function takes a positive integer as input and returns its Roman numeral representation in lowercase.

### Function Signature

```python
def int_to_mini_roman(number):
    """
    Given a positive integer, obtain its roman numeral equivalent as a string,
    and return it in lowercase.
    Restrictions: 1 <= num <= 1000

    Examples:
    >>> int_to_mini_roman(19) == 'xix'
    >>> int_to_mini_roman(152) == 'clii'
    >>> int_to_mini_roman(426) == 'cdxxvi'
    """
```

### Usage

To use the `int_to_mini_roman` function, simply call it with a positive integer within the specified range. The function will return the Roman numeral equivalent in lowercase.

#### Example

```python
print(int_to_mini_roman(19))  # Output: 'xix'
print(int_to_mini_roman(152)) # Output: 'clii'
print(int_to_mini_roman(426)) # Output: 'cdxxvi'
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it easy to set up and use. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or download the repository**: Obtain the source code for the function.

3. **Run the code**: Use a Python interpreter to execute the `main.py` file containing the function.

## Documentation

This software is straightforward and does not require additional documentation beyond this manual. The function is self-contained and does not rely on any external libraries or modules.

For further assistance or inquiries, please contact our support team.
