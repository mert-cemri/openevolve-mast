I agree. An "Application" is the most appropriate modality for this task as it focuses on implementing the code solution directly. This aligns with the customer's request to write the necessary software code without any additional features. Let's proceed with this modality.

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To solve the task, we need to implement the `even_odd_count` function in Python. This function will take an integer as input and return a tuple containing the count of even and odd digits in the integer. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Function Name**: `even_odd_count`
   - **Purpose**: To count the number of even and odd digits in a given integer.

2. **Steps to Implement**:
   - Convert the integer to a string to iterate over each digit.
   - Use a loop to iterate through each character in the string representation of the number.
   - Check if the character is a digit (to handle negative signs).
   - Convert the character back to an integer and check if it is even or odd.
   - Maintain a count of even and odd digits.
   - Return the counts as a tuple.

Now, let's write the code for this function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

Given an integer, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively.

Example:
    even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)
    even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)

'''

def even_odd_count(num):
    # Convert the number to a string to iterate over each character
    num_str = str(num)
    
    # Initialize counters for even and odd digits
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string representation of the number
    for char in num_str:
        # Check if the character is a digit
        if char.isdigit():
            # Convert the character to an integer
            digit = int(char)
            # Check if the digit is even or odd and update the respective counter
            if digit % 2 == 0:
                even_count += 1
            else:
                odd_count += 1
    
    # Return the counts as a tuple
    return (even_count, odd_count)
```

This code will correctly count the number of even and odd digits in the given integer and return them as a tuple.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Even Odd Count

A simple Python function to count the number of even and odd digits in an integer.

## Overview

The `even_odd_count` function takes an integer as input and returns a tuple containing the count of even and odd digits in the number. This function handles both positive and negative integers.

### Example Usage

- `even_odd_count(-12)` returns `(1, 1)`
- `even_odd_count(123)` returns `(1, 2)`

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies. It is implemented in pure Python, and you can run it in any standard Python environment.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**

   You can clone the repository using Git or download the files directly.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**

   Change your working directory to where the `main.py` file is located.

   ```bash
   cd <directory-path>
   ```

3. **Run the Function:**

   You can use the function in a Python script or an interactive Python session. Here is an example of how to use it:

   print(result)  # Output: (1, 1)

   result = even_odd_count(123)
   print(result)  # Output: (1, 2)
   ```

## Documentation

The function is straightforward and does not require additional configuration. It processes the input integer by converting it to a string, iterating over each digit, and counting how many are even and how many are odd.

### Function Definition

```python
def even_odd_count(num):
    """
    Given an integer, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively.

    Parameters:
    num (int): The integer to be processed.
