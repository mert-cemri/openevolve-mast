Given the task at hand, which involves writing a piece of software code to solve a specific problem, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a functional piece of software, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts on this?

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To complete the task, we need to implement a function `words_in_sentence` that filters words in a sentence based on whether their lengths are prime numbers. We will focus on implementing this function in a single Python file, `main.py`, without any GUI, as per the customer's request. Here's how we can approach this:

### Core Function

1. **Function: `is_prime(n)`**
   - **Purpose**: Check if a given number `n` is a prime number.
   - **Details**: A helper function to determine if a number is prime.

2. **Function: `words_in_sentence(sentence)`**
   - **Purpose**: Process the input sentence and return a string with words whose lengths are prime numbers.
   - **Details**: Split the sentence into words, filter them using the `is_prime` function, and join them back into a string.

### Implementation

Let's implement the solution in `main.py`.

#### main.py

```python
'''

This module contains a function to filter words in a sentence based on the length of the words being prime numbers.

'''

def is_prime(n):
    """
    Check if a number is a prime number.

    :param n: Integer to check for primality
    :return: True if n is a prime number, False otherwise
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    You are given a string representing a sentence,
    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,
    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,
    whose lengths are prime numbers,
    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.

    Example 1:
        Input: sentence = "This is a test"
        Output: "is"

    Example 2:
        Input: sentence = "lets go for swimming"
        Output: "go for"

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100
        * sentence contains only letters
    """
    words = sentence.split()
    prime_length_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    return ' '.join(prime_length_words)

# Example usage:
# print(words_in_sentence("This is a test"))  # Output: "is"
# print(words_in_sentence("lets go for swimming"))  # Output: "go for"
```

### Explanation

- **`is_prime(n)`**: This function checks if a number `n` is prime by testing divisibility. It handles small numbers directly and uses a loop to check larger numbers.
- **`words_in_sentence(sentence)`**: This function splits the sentence into words, checks each word's length for primality using `is_prime`, and constructs a new sentence from words with prime lengths.

This solution is efficient and meets the customer's requirements without any unnecessary components like a GUI.

### Explanation

- **`is_prime(n)`**: This function checks if a number `n` is prime by testing divisibility. It handles small numbers directly and uses a loop to check larger numbers.
- **`words_in_sentence(sentence)`**: This function splits the sentence into words, checks each word's length for primality using `is_prime`, and constructs a new sentence from words with prime lengths.

This solution is efficient and meets the customer's requirements without any unnecessary components like a GUI.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code only uses built-in Python functions and libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```

As the Chief Executive Officer, I can confirm that the Programmer's assessment is correct. The provided Python code for the function `words_in_sentence` and its helper function `is_prime` does not rely on any external libraries or packages. It solely uses Python's built-in capabilities. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project should indeed be empty, indicating that no additional dependencies are necessary for the code to function as intended.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
