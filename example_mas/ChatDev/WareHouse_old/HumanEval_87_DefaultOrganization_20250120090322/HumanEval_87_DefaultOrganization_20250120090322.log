Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and testing a piece of software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to focus on the functionality and correctness of the code without the need for additional presentation or visualization formats. What are your thoughts on this?

You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To complete the task, we need to implement the `get_row` function as specified in the task description. The function will be implemented in a single Python file named `main.py`. Since the task explicitly mentions not to implement a GUI interface or anything redundant, we will focus solely on the logic required to solve the problem.

Here's the plan:

1. **Function `get_row(lst, x)`**: This function will take a list of lists (`lst`) and an integer (`x`). It will find all occurrences of `x` in the nested lists and return a list of tuples representing the coordinates of `x` in the format `(row, column)`. The coordinates will be sorted by rows in ascending order and by columns in descending order within each row.

Now, let's implement the code in `main.py`.

```python

This module contains the implementation of the get_row function, which finds all occurrences of a given integer in a 2D list and returns their coordinates sorted by specific criteria.

    ], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]
    get_row([], 1) == []
    get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]
    """
    coordinates = []
    for row_index, row in enumerate(lst):
        for col_index, value in enumerate(row):
            if value == x:
                coordinates.append((row_index, col_index))
    
    # Sort by row in ascending order and by column in descending order
    coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))
    
    return coordinates
```

This code defines the `get_row` function, which processes the input list of lists to find the specified integer `x` and returns the sorted list of coordinates as described. The sorting is done using a lambda function that sorts primarily by row index and secondarily by negative column index to achieve the desired order.

```python
'''

This module contains the implementation of the get_row function, which finds all occurrences of a given integer in a 2D list and returns their coordinates sorted by specific criteria.

'''

def get_row(lst, x):
    """
    You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists,
    which is similar to matrix, however, unlike matrices,
    each row may contain a different number of columns.
    Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list,
    and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that
    each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0.
    Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order.
    Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.
    
    Examples:
    get_row([
      [1,2,3,4,5,6],
      [1,2,3,4,1,6],
      [1,2,3,4,5,1]
    ], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]
    get_row([], 1) == []
    get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]
    """
    coordinates = []
    for row_index, row in enumerate(lst):
        for col_index, value in enumerate(row):
            if value == x:
                coordinates.append((row_index, col_index))
    
    # Sort by row in ascending order and by column in descending order
    coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))
    
    return coordinates
```

This code defines the `get_row` function, which processes the input list of lists to find the specified integer `x` and returns the sorted list of coordinates as described. The sorting is done using a lambda function that sorts primarily by row index and secondarily by negative column index to achieve the desired order.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

    Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list,
    and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that
    each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0.
    Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order.
    Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.

Based on the provided code, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The function `get_row` is implemented using only built-in Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no additional dependencies needed.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
```

This indicates that the project does not require any external Python packages to run.

As the Chief Executive Officer, I concur with the Programmer's assessment. The provided code for the `get_row` function does not utilize any external libraries or packages beyond Python's built-in capabilities. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, indicating that no additional dependencies are required for this project. Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
```

This empty file reflects that the project can run using the standard Python environment without needing any additional packages. If there are any future changes or additions to the code that require external libraries, the `requirements.txt` file should be updated accordingly to include those dependencies.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# get_row Function

This software module provides a utility function, `get_row`, designed to locate all occurrences of a specified integer within a 2D list (nested lists) and return their coordinates sorted by specific criteria.

## Main Functionality

### get_row(lst, x)

- **Description**: 
  - This function takes a 2D list (`lst`) and an integer (`x`) as inputs.
  - It searches for all occurrences of the integer `x` within the 2D list.
  - Returns a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the coordinates (row, column) of `x` in the list.
  - The coordinates are sorted first by rows in ascending order and then by columns in descending order.

- **Parameters**:
  - `lst`: A list of lists, where each sublist represents a row in the 2D data structure.
  - `x`: An integer to search for within the 2D list.

- **Returns**:
  - A list of tuples, each representing the coordinates of the integer `x` in the format `(row_index, column_index)`.

- **Examples**:
  ```python
  get_row([
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6],
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
  ], 1) 
  # Output: [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]

  get_row([], 1) 
  # Output: []

  get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) 
  # Output: [(2, 2)]
  ```
