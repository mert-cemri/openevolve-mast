- **Answer Selection**: Users can select an answer from the provided options.
- **Answer Validation**: Upon submission, the application checks if the selected answer is correct and provides feedback.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- **Tkinter**: Tkinter is included with Python's standard library, so no additional installation is required for this dependency.
