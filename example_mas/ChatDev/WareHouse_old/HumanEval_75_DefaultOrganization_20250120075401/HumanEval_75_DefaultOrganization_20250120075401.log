Given the task at hand, which involves writing a function to determine if a number is the multiplication of three prime numbers, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task involves implementing a software tool that requires coding and logic, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree. An "Application" is the most appropriate product modality for this task, as it involves writing and executing a piece of software code to solve a specific problem. This aligns well with the nature of the task, which is to implement a function in Python.

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `is_multiply_prime(a)` that checks if a given number `a` is the product of exactly three prime numbers. Since the number `a` is less than 100, we can work with a limited set of prime numbers. We will not implement a GUI as the task explicitly states not to do so.

### Core Function

- **is_multiply_prime(a):** This function will determine if the input number `a` is the product of exactly three prime numbers.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

```python

    return False

# Example usage

```

This code defines the function `is_multiply_prime(a)` which checks if the number `a` is the product of exactly three prime numbers from the list `[2, 3, 5, 7]`. It iterates over all possible combinations of these primes and checks if their product equals `a`. If it finds such a combination, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.

"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The function `is_multiply_prime` only utilizes basic Python functionality and does not require any additional dependencies. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, as there are no packages to specify.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Prime Multiplication Checker

This software provides a simple function to determine if a given number is the product of exactly three prime numbers. It is designed to work with numbers less than 100.

## Main Function

The core functionality of this software is encapsulated in the `is_multiply_prime` function. This function takes an integer input and returns `True` if the number is the product of exactly three prime numbers, and `False` otherwise.

### Function Definition

```python
def is_multiply_prime(a):
    """

## Installation

This project does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to set up and use. You only need Python installed on your system.

### Steps to Install

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If the code is hosted on a version control system like GitHub, clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your working directory to the location where the project files are stored.

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

4. **Run the Code**: You can directly run the `main.py` file to test the function.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

To use the `is_multiply_prime` function, you simply need to call it with an integer argument. The function will return a boolean value indicating whether the number is the product of exactly three prime numbers.

### Example Usage

```python
result = is_multiply_prime(30)
print(result)  # Output: True

result = is_multiply_prime(28)
print(result)  # Output: False
```

## Additional Information

- **Limitations**: The function is designed to work with numbers less than 100. It uses a predefined list of prime numbers under 10 to check combinations.

- **No External Libraries Required**: This project is self-contained and does not require any additional Python packages.

- **Modifications**: If you wish to extend the functionality to numbers greater than 100, you will need to modify the list of prime numbers and potentially the logic for checking combinations.
