To solve the task, we need to implement the function `find_max` in Python. The function should take a list of strings and return the word with the maximum number of unique characters. If there are multiple words with the same number of unique characters, the function should return the one that comes first in lexicographical order.

Here is the plan:

1. **Function: `find_max(words)`**
   - **Purpose**: To find the word with the maximum number of unique characters from a list of words.
   - **Steps**:
     - Iterate through each word in the list.
     - For each word, calculate the number of unique characters.
     - Keep track of the word with the maximum number of unique characters.
     - If two words have the same number of unique characters, choose the one that comes first lexicographically.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python
'''

This module contains the function `find_max` which finds the word with the maximum number of unique characters from a list of words.

'''

def find_max(words):
    """Write a function that accepts a list of strings.
    The list contains different words. Return the word with maximum number
    of unique characters. If multiple strings have maximum number of unique
    characters, return the one which comes first in lexicographical order.

    find_max(["name", "of", "string"]) == "string"
    find_max(["name", "enam", "game"]) == "enam"
    find_max(["aaaaaaa", "bb" ,"cc"]) == "aaaaaaa"
    """
    max_unique_count = 0
    result_word = None

    for word in words:
        unique_chars = set(word)
        unique_count = len(unique_chars)

        if unique_count > max_unique_count:
            max_unique_count = unique_count
            result_word = word
        elif unique_count == max_unique_count:
            if result_word is None or word < result_word:
                result_word = word

    return result_word

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(find_max(["name", "of", "string"]))  # Output: "string"
    print(find_max(["name", "enam", "game"]))  # Output: "enam"
    print(find_max(["aaaaaaa", "bb", "cc"]))  # Output: "aaaaaaa"
```

This code will correctly find the word with the maximum number of unique characters from a list of words, following the specified rules.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

As the Chief Executive Officer, I concur with the Programmer's assessment. The function `find_max` utilizes only Python's built-in features and does not require any external libraries or packages. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, indicating that no additional dependencies are needed for this project. Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
```

This empty file confirms that the project relies solely on Python's standard library and does not require any external packages to function correctly.

# Find Max Unique Characters

This software provides a simple utility function to find the word with the maximum number of unique characters from a list of words. If multiple words have the same number of unique characters, it returns the one that comes first in lexicographical order.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `find_max`, which performs the following operations:

- Accepts a list of strings (words).
- Calculates the number of unique characters in each word.
- Returns the word with the maximum number of unique characters.
- In case of a tie (multiple words with the same number of unique characters), it returns the word that comes first in lexicographical order.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example 1
words = ["name", "of", "string"]
result = find_max(words)
print(result)  # Output: "string"

# Example 2
words = ["name", "enam", "game"]
result = find_max(words)
print(result)  # Output: "enam"

# Example 3
words = ["aaaaaaa", "bb", "cc"]
result = find_max(words)
print(result)  # Output: "aaaaaaa"
```

## Installation

This software is written in Python and does not have any external dependencies. You can run it in any standard Python environment.

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the repository**: If the code is hosted in a repository, clone it to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Run the code**: You can run the code directly using Python.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Import the function**: If you are using this function in another script, import it from the module.

   ```python
   from main import find_max
   ```

2. **Call the function**: Pass a list of words to the `find_max` function to get the desired result.

   ```python
   words = ["example", "words", "here"]
   result = find_max(words)
   print(result)
   ```

## Additional Information

- **No external libraries**: This software does not require any external libraries or dependencies, making it lightweight and easy to integrate into other projects.
- **Python version**: It is recommended to use Python 3.6 or higher to ensure compatibility with the latest language features.

For any further questions or support, please contact our support team at ChatDev.
