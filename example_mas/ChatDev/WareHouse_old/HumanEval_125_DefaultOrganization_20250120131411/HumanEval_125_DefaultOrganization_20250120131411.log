Considering the nature of the task, which involves writing and fixing a piece of software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This would allow us to implement the necessary code in Python and ensure it functions as required. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, we need to implement the function `split_words` in Python as specified by the customer. The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus solely on implementing the function in a single Python file. Here's the plan:

### Core Function:
- **split_words(txt)**: This function will take a string `txt` and perform the following operations:
  - Split the string on whitespace if any exist.
  - If no whitespace exists, split the string on commas.
  - If neither whitespace nor commas exist, count the number of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python
'''
Given a string of words, return a list of words split on whitespace, if no whitespaces exists in the text you
should split on commas ',' if no commas exists you should return the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the
alphabet, ord('a') = 0, ord('b') = 1, ... ord('z') = 25
Examples
split_words("Hello world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]
split_words("Hello,world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]
split_words("abcdef") == 3 
'''

def split_words(txt):
    # Check if there are any whitespaces in the text
    if ' ' in txt:
        return txt.split()
    # Check if there are any commas in the text
    elif ',' in txt:
        return txt.split(',')
    else:
        # Calculate the number of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet
        odd_count = sum(1 for char in txt if char.islower() and (ord(char) - ord('a')) % 2 == 1)
        return odd_count

# Example usage
print(split_words("Hello world!"))  # ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]
print(split_words("Hello,world!"))  # ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]
print(split_words("abcdef"))        # ➞ 3
```

This code implements the required functionality as described in the task. It checks for whitespace and commas to split the string accordingly and counts lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet if neither is present.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages used. The code relies solely on Python's built-in functions and standard library. Therefore, a `requirements.txt` file is not necessary for this project, as there are no additional dependencies required.

However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can create an empty one:

```
# requirements.txt

# No external dependencies required for this project.
```

This indicates that the project does not require any additional packages beyond the standard Python installation.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages used. The code relies solely on Python's built-in functions and standard library. Therefore, a `requirements.txt` file is not necessary for this project, as there are no additional dependencies required.
However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can create an empty one:
```
# requirements.txt
# No external dependencies required for this project.
```
This indicates that the project does not require any additional packages beyond the standard Python installation. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I agree with the Programmer's assessment. The provided code in `main.py` does not utilize any external libraries or packages, relying solely on Python's built-in functions and standard library. Therefore, a `requirements.txt` file is not necessary for this project. However, for the sake of completeness and to maintain standard project documentation practices, you can create an empty `requirements.txt` file with a comment indicating that no external dependencies are required:

```

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Split Words Application

This application provides a simple utility function to process strings of text. It splits the text into words based on specific criteria and returns either a list of words or a count of specific lowercase letters.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this application is encapsulated in the `split_words` function. This function takes a string input and processes it according to the following rules:

1. **Whitespace Splitting**: If the input string contains whitespace, the function splits the string into a list of words based on the whitespace.

2. **Comma Splitting**: If there are no whitespaces but commas are present, the function splits the string into a list of words based on the commas.

3. **Odd Order Lowercase Count**: If neither whitespaces nor commas are present, the function calculates the number of lowercase letters in the string that have an odd order in the alphabet (e.g., 'b', 'd', 'f', etc.) and returns this count.

### Examples

- `split_words("Hello world!")` returns `["Hello", "world!"]`
- `split_words("Hello,world!")` returns `["Hello", "world!"]`
- `split_words("abcdef")` returns `3`
