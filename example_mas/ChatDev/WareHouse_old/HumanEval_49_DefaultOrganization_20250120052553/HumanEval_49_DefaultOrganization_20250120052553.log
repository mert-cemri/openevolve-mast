To complete the task as specified, we need to implement the function `modp` in Python to compute \(2^n \mod p\). The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus solely on the function implementation. Let's proceed with the necessary code.

### Core Function

- **Function `modp(n: int, p: int)`:** This function calculates \(2^n \mod p\) using efficient modular exponentiation to handle large numbers.

Now, let's write the code for the `main.py` file.

#### main.py

```python
'''

This module contains the function modp which calculates 2^n modulo p.

'''

def modp(n: int, p: int) -> int:
    """Return 2^n modulo p.
    
    Uses efficient modular exponentiation to handle large exponents.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The exponent.
        p (int): The modulus.
    
    Returns:
        int: The result of 2^n % p.
    
    Examples:
        >>> modp(3, 5)
        3
        >>> modp(1101, 101)
        2
        >>> modp(0, 101)
        1
        >>> modp(3, 11)
        8
        >>> modp(100, 101)
        1
    """
    result = 1
    base = 2
    
    while n > 0:
        # If n is odd, multiply base with result
        if n % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % p
        
        # n must be even now
        n = n // 2
        base = (base * base) % p
    
    return result
```

This code implements the `modp` function using the method of exponentiation by squaring, which is efficient for computing large powers modulo a number. This approach ensures that we handle large values of `n` without running into performance issues.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external libraries or packages used. The function `modp` only relies on Python's built-in capabilities. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no additional dependencies required.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**
