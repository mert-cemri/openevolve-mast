# Right Angle Triangle Checker

This software provides a simple function to determine if three given side lengths can form a right-angled triangle. It utilizes the Pythagorean theorem to verify the condition for a right-angled triangle.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is:

- `right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)`: This function takes three arguments, which are the lengths of the sides of a triangle. It returns `True` if the sides form a right-angled triangle and `False` otherwise.

### Example Usage

```python
right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5)  # Returns: True
right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)  # Returns: False
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to use. You only need to have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Clone or download the repository**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the function.

3. **Run the function**: You can use the function in any Python environment by importing or directly using the `main.py` file.

## How to Use

1. **Open a Python environment**: This could be a Python shell, a script, or an integrated development environment (IDE) like PyCharm or VSCode.

2. **Import the function**: If you are using the function in another script, you can import it using:
   ```python
   from main import right_angle_triangle
   ```

3. **Call the function**: Use the function with the desired side lengths to check if they form a right-angled triangle.

## Documentation

The function is straightforward and does not require additional documentation. It uses the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
