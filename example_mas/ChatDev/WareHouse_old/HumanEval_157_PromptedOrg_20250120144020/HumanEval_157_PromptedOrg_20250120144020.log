To solve the task, we need to implement a function that checks if three given sides can form a right-angled triangle. The function will use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Here's the plan:

1. **Function: `right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)`**
   - **Purpose**: Determine if the given sides `a`, `b`, and `c` can form a right-angled triangle.
   - **Logic**: 
     - Identify the largest side, which should be the hypotenuse.
     - Check if the square of the largest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
     - Return `True` if the condition is met, otherwise return `False`.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

main.py

```python

'''

Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
90 degree.
Example:
right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False

'''

def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    # Sort the sides to identify the hypotenuse
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    # Check the Pythagorean theorem
    return sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2

```

This code defines the `right_angle_triangle` function, which sorts the sides to ensure the largest is treated as the hypotenuse, then checks if the Pythagorean theorem holds true for these sides. If it does, the function returns `True`, indicating the sides form a right-angled triangle; otherwise, it returns `False`.

You are a Code Reviewer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to review and assess source code written by programmers. You ensure code quality by identifying bugs, optimizing performance, and enforcing coding standards. You provide constructive feedback to improve software robustness.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and work closely with programmers.
Here is a new customer's task:

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Here is a conversation between two roles: Programmer: ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.

"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `right_angle_triangle` only uses basic Python operations and does not rely on any external libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty.
Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the CEO, I confirm that the Programmer's assessment is correct. The `right_angle_triangle` function utilizes basic Python operations and does not require any external libraries or packages. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, indicating that there are no additional dependencies needed for this project.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project

# Right Angle Triangle Checker

This software provides a simple function to determine if three given side lengths can form a right-angled triangle. It utilizes the Pythagorean theorem to verify the condition for a right-angled triangle.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is:

- `right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)`: This function takes three arguments, which are the lengths of the sides of a triangle. It returns `True` if the sides form a right-angled triangle and `False` otherwise.

### Example Usage

```python
right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5)  # Returns: True
right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)  # Returns: False
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to use. You only need to have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Clone or download the repository**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the function.

3. **Run the function**: You can use the function in any Python environment by importing or directly using the `main.py` file.

## How to Use

1. **Open a Python environment**: This could be a Python shell, a script, or an integrated development environment (IDE) like PyCharm or VSCode.

2. **Import the function**: If you are using the function in another script, you can import it using:
   ```python
   from main import right_angle_triangle
   ```

3. **Call the function**: Use the function with the desired side lengths to check if they form a right-angled triangle.

## Documentation

The function is straightforward and does not require additional documentation. It uses the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

 # Right Angle Triangle Checker

This software provides a simple function to determine if three given side lengths can form a right-angled triangle. It utilizes the Pythagorean theorem to verify the condition for a right-angled triangle.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is:

- `right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)`: This function takes three arguments, which are the lengths of the sides of a triangle. It returns `True` if the sides form a right-angled triangle and `False` otherwise.

### Example Usage

```python
right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5)  # Returns: True
right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)  # Returns: False
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to use. You only need to have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Clone or download the repository**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the function.

3. **Run the function**: You can use the function in any Python environment by importing or directly using the `main.py` file.

## How to Use

1. **Open a Python environment**: This could be a Python shell, a script, or an integrated development environment (IDE) like PyCharm or VSCode.

2. **Import the function**: If you are using the function in another script, you can import it using:
   ```python
   from main import right_angle_triangle
   ```

3. **Call the function**: Use the function with the desired side lengths to check if they form a right-angled triangle.

## Documentation
