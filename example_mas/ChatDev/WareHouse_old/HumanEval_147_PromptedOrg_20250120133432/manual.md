# Get Max Triples User Manual

Welcome to the Get Max Triples software! This software is designed to calculate the number of valid triples from an array generated by a specific formula. A valid triple is one where the sum of the elements is a multiple of 3.

## Main Functionality

The main function of this software is `get_max_triples(n)`, which performs the following tasks:

1. **Array Generation**: It generates an integer array `a` of length `n` where each element is calculated using the formula: `a[i] = i * i - i + 1` for each `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n).

2. **Triple Calculation**: It calculates the number of triples `(a[i], a[j], a[k])` where `i < j < k` and the sum of the triple is a multiple of 3.

3. **Output**: Returns the count of such valid triples.

### Example

For an input `n = 5`, the function generates the array `[1, 3, 7, 13, 21]`. The only valid triple in this case is `(1, 7, 13)`, and the function will return `1`.

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies. You can run it using Python without needing to install additional packages.

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.

3. **Run the Script**: You can run the script using Python. For example, to find the number of valid triples for `n = 5`, you can execute:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Make sure to include the function call within the script or modify it to accept command-line arguments if needed.

## Usage

To use the `get_max_triples` function, simply call it with a positive integer `n` as the argument. Here is an example of how to use the function in a Python script:

```python
from main import get_max_triples

# Example usage
result = get_max_triples(5)
print(result)  # Output: 1
```

## Documentation

The function is documented within the code, providing a detailed explanation of its purpose and usage. You can refer to the docstring in the `main.py` file for more information.
