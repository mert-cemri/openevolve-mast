To solve the task, we need to implement a function that converts a list of GPAs into their corresponding letter grades based on the provided grading scale. The function will iterate over the list of GPAs and map each GPA to its respective letter grade using conditional statements.

Let's outline the core function:

1. **Function: `numerical_letter_grade(grades)`**
   - **Purpose**: Convert a list of GPAs into a list of letter grades based on the given grading scale.
   - **Input**: A list of GPAs (e.g., `[4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]`).
   - **Output**: A list of letter grades corresponding to the GPAs (e.g., `['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']`).

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

main.py

```python

'''

It is the last week of the semester and the teacher has to give the grades
to students. The teacher has been making her own algorithm for grading.
The only problem is, she has lost the code she used for grading.
She has given you a list of GPAs for some students and you have to write 
a function that can output a list of letter grades using the following table:
         GPA       |    Letter grade
          4.0                A+
        > 3.7                A 
        > 3.3                A- 
        > 3.0                B+
        > 2.7                B 
        > 2.3                B-
        > 2.0                C+
        > 1.7                C
        > 1.3                C-

def numerical_letter_grade(grades):
    letter_grades = []
    for gpa in grades:
        if gpa == 4.0:
            letter_grades.append('A+')
        elif gpa > 3.7:
            letter_grades.append('A')
        elif gpa > 3.3:
            letter_grades.append('A-')
        elif gpa > 3.0:
            letter_grades.append('B+')
        elif gpa > 2.7:
            letter_grades.append('B')
        elif gpa > 2.3:
            letter_grades.append('B-')
        elif gpa > 2.0:
            letter_grades.append('C+')
        elif gpa > 1.7:
            letter_grades.append('C')
        elif gpa > 1.3:
            letter_grades.append('C-')
        elif gpa > 1.0:
            letter_grades.append('D+')
        elif gpa > 0.7:
            letter_grades.append('D')
        elif gpa > 0.0:
            letter_grades.append('D-')
        else:
            letter_grades.append('E')
    return letter_grades

# Example usage
# print(numerical_letter_grade([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]))  # Output: ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']
```

This code defines the `numerical_letter_grade` function, which takes a list of GPAs and returns a list of corresponding letter grades based on the specified grading scale. The function uses a series of conditional statements to determine the correct letter grade for each GPA.

 To solve the task, we need to implement a function that converts a list of GPAs into their corresponding letter grades based on the provided grading scale. The function will iterate over the list of GPAs and map each GPA to its respective letter grade using conditional statements.

Let's outline the core function:

1. **Function: `numerical_letter_grade(grades)`**
   - **Purpose**: Convert a list of GPAs into a list of letter grades based on the given grading scale.
   - **Input**: A list of GPAs (e.g., `[4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]`).
   - **Output**: A list of letter grades corresponding to the GPAs (e.g., `['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']`).

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

main.py

```python

'''

It is the last week of the semester and the teacher has to give the grades
to students. The teacher has been making her own algorithm for grading.
The only problem is, she has lost the code she used for grading.
She has given you a list of GPAs for some students and you have to write 
a function that can output a list of letter grades using the following table:
         GPA       |    Letter grade
          4.0                A+
        > 3.7                A 
        > 3.3                A- 
        > 3.0                B+
        > 2.7                B 
        > 2.3                B-
        > 2.0                C+
        > 1.7                C
        > 1.3                C-
        > 1.0                D+ 
        > 0.7                D 
        > 0.0                D-
          0.0                E

Example:
grade_equation([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) ==> ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']

'''

def numerical_letter_grade(grades):
    letter_grades = []
    for gpa in grades:
        if gpa == 4.0:
            letter_grades.append('A+')
        elif gpa > 3.7:
            letter_grades.append('A')
        elif gpa > 3.3:
            letter_grades.append('A-')
        elif gpa > 3.0:
            letter_grades.append('B+')
        elif gpa > 2.7:
            letter_grades.append('B')
        elif gpa > 2.3:
            letter_grades.append('B-')
        elif gpa > 2.0:
            letter_grades.append('C+')
        elif gpa > 1.7:
            letter_grades.append('C')
        elif gpa > 1.3:
            letter_grades.append('C-')
        elif gpa > 1.0:
            letter_grades.append('D+')
        elif gpa > 0.7:
            letter_grades.append('D')
        elif gpa > 0.0:
            letter_grades.append('D-')
        else:
            letter_grades.append('E')
    return letter_grades

# Example usage
# print(numerical_letter_grade([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]))  # Output: ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']
```

This code defines the `numerical_letter_grade` function, which takes a list of GPAs and returns a list of corresponding letter grades based on the specified grading scale. The function uses a series of conditional statements to determine the correct letter grade for each GPA.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

    """It is the last week of the semester and the teacher has to give the grades
    to students. The teacher has been making her own algorithm for grading.
    The only problem is, she has lost the code she used for grading.
    She has given you a list of GPAs for some students and you have to write 
    a function that can output a list of letter grades using the following table:
             GPA       |    Letter grade
              4.0                A+

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

It is the last week of the semester and the teacher has to give the grades
to students. The teacher has been making her own algorithm for grading.
The only problem is, she has lost the code she used for grading.
She has given you a list of GPAs for some students and you have to write 
a function that can output a list of letter grades using the following table:

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the given code, there are no external libraries or packages used that need to be specified in a `requirements.txt` file. The function `numerical_letter_grade` only uses basic Python functionality, which is part of the standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty.

However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for the project, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that there are no additional dependencies needed for the project to run.

It is the last week of the semester and the teacher has to give the grades
to students. The teacher has been making her own algorithm for grading.
The only problem is, she has lost the code she used for grading.
She has given you a list of GPAs for some students and you have to write 
a function that can output a list of letter grades using the following table:
         GPA       |    Letter grade
          4.0                A+
        > 3.7                A 
        > 3.3                A-

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code, there are no external libraries or packages used that need to be specified in a `requirements.txt` file. The function `numerical_letter_grade` only uses basic Python functionality, which is part of the standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty.
However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for the project, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that there are no additional dependencies needed for the project to run. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

The programmer is correct in their assessment. The provided code for the `numerical_letter_grade` function does not utilize any external libraries or packages beyond Python's standard library. Therefore, there are no additional dependencies required for this project. 

If you still wish to create a `requirements.txt` file for documentation purposes, it would indeed be empty or contain a comment indicating that no external dependencies are needed. Here is how it would look:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This file serves as a placeholder to indicate that the project does not rely on any third-party packages.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
