To solve the task, we need to implement the function `find_max` in Python. This function will take a list of strings and return the word with the maximum number of unique characters. If multiple words have the same number of unique characters, the function will return the one that comes first in lexicographical order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Define the Function**: We'll define a function `find_max` that accepts a list of strings.
2. **Calculate Unique Characters**: For each word, calculate the number of unique characters.
3. **Determine Maximum**: Track the word with the maximum number of unique characters.
4. **Handle Ties**: If there is a tie, choose the word that comes first lexicographically.
5. **Return Result**: Return the word that meets the criteria.

Now, let's implement the function in a Python file named `main.py`.

MAIN.PY

```python

'''

Write a function that accepts a list of strings.
The list contains different words. Return the word with maximum number
of unique characters. If multiple strings have maximum number of unique
characters, return the one which comes first in lexicographical order.

find_max(["name", "of", "string"]) == "string"
find_max(["name", "enam", "game"]) == "enam"
find_max(["aaaaaaa", "bb" ,"cc"]) == "aaaaaaa"

'''

def find_max(words):
    # Initialize variables to track the word with the maximum unique characters
    max_unique_count = 0
    max_word = None
    
    for word in words:
        # Calculate the number of unique characters in the word
        unique_chars = set(word)
        unique_count = len(unique_chars)
        
        # Check if this word has more unique characters or is lexicographically smaller in case of a tie
        if unique_count > max_unique_count or (unique_count == max_unique_count and (max_word is None or word < max_word)):
            max_unique_count = unique_count
            max_word = word
            
    return max_word

# Example usage
print(find_max(["name", "of", "string"]))  # Output: "string"
print(find_max(["name", "enam", "game"]))  # Output: "enam"
print(find_max(["aaaaaaa", "bb" ,"cc"]))   # Output: "aaaaaaa"

```

This code defines the `find_max` function, which processes the list of words to find the one with the maximum number of unique characters, handling ties by choosing the lexicographically smaller word. The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how the function works with the provided test cases.

            max_unique_count = unique_count
            max_word = word
            
    return max_word

# Example usage

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

The Programmer is correct in their assessment. The provided code for the `find_max` function does not rely on any external libraries or packages; it uses only built-in Python features. Therefore, there are no dependencies to list in a `requirements.txt` file. However, for completeness and to adhere to standard practices, you can include a `requirements.txt` file with a comment indicating that no external dependencies are required. Here is how it would look:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This file serves as documentation that the project does not require any additional packages beyond the standard Python library.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Find Max User Manual

Welcome to the Find Max software! This tool is designed to help you find the word with the maximum number of unique characters from a list of strings. If multiple words have the same number of unique characters, the software will return the one that comes first in lexicographical order.

## Main Functionality

The main function of this software is `find_max(words)`, which accepts a list of strings and returns the word with the maximum number of unique characters. The function handles ties by returning the lexicographically smallest word.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage of the find_max function
print(find_max(["name", "of", "string"]))  # Output: "string"
print(find_max(["name", "enam", "game"]))  # Output: "enam"
print(find_max(["aaaaaaa", "bb", "cc"]))   # Output: "aaaaaaa"
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it easy to set up and use. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download Python from the official website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or download the repository**: Obtain the `main.py` file from the repository where this software is hosted.

3. **Run the script**: Use a Python interpreter to run the script and test the function with your own list of words.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare your list of words**: Create a list of strings that you want to analyze.

2. **Call the `find_max` function**: Pass your list of words to the `find_max` function.

3. **Receive the result**: The function will return the word with the maximum number of unique characters, or the lexicographically smallest word in case of a tie.

## Documentation

For further details on how the function works, refer to the comments within the `main.py` file. The code is well-documented to help you understand the logic behind the function.

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please reach out to our support team for assistance.

Thank you for using Find Max! We hope this tool enhances your productivity and meets your needs effectively.
