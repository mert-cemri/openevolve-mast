Given the task at hand, which involves writing a piece of software code to compute a sequence, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to focus on implementing the code efficiently without any additional presentation or visualization requirements. What are your thoughts on this?

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To solve the task, we need to implement the `fib4` function in Python, which computes the n-th element of the Fib4 number sequence without using recursion. The sequence is defined as follows:

- fib4(0) -> 0
- fib4(1) -> 0
- fib4(2) -> 2
- fib4(3) -> 0
- fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4) for n >= 4

Given the task requirements, we will implement this function in a single file, `main.py`. The function will use an iterative approach with a list to store the last four computed values, which will allow us to compute the sequence efficiently.

Let's proceed with the implementation:

```python

    # Initialize the first four elements of the sequence
    fib_sequence = [0, 0, 2, 0]

    # Compute the sequence iteratively
    for i in range(4, n + 1):
        next_value = fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2] + fib_sequence[-3] + fib_sequence[-4]

This implementation uses a list to keep track of the last four values of the sequence, updating it iteratively to compute the next value. This approach ensures that the function is efficient and avoids the overhead of recursion.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required to run the project. The code is purely based on Python's built-in functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any third-party libraries.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required to run the project. The code is purely based on Python's built-in functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that the project does not rely on any third-party libraries. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

The Programmer's assessment is correct. The provided code for the `fib4` function does not require any external libraries or packages beyond Python's built-in capabilities. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty or contain a comment indicating that no external dependencies are required. Here is the `requirements.txt` file for this project:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This file serves as documentation that the project does not rely on any third-party libraries. If there are any future changes that introduce dependencies, this file should be updated accordingly.

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Fib4 Sequence Calculator

This software provides a function to compute the n-th element of the Fib4 number sequence, a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with a different set of rules. The software is implemented in Python and is designed to be efficient by avoiding recursion.

## Main Functions

The main function of this software is:

- **fib4(n: int) -> int**: Computes the n-th element of the Fib4 number sequence. The sequence is defined as follows:
  - fib4(0) -> 0
  - fib4(1) -> 0
  - fib4(2) -> 2
  - fib4(3) -> 0
  - fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4) for n >= 4

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies. You only need Python installed on your system to run the code.

### Steps to Install Python

1. **Download Python**: Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for your operating system.

2. **Install Python**: Follow the instructions provided on the website to install Python on your system. Make sure to check the option to add Python to your system's PATH during installation.

3. **Verify Installation**: Open a terminal or command prompt and type `python --version` to verify that Python is installed correctly.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If the code is hosted on a version control system, clone the repository to your local machine. Otherwise, download the `main.py` file.

2. **Run the Code**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing `main.py`, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will execute the example usage of the `fib4` function, printing the results for `fib4(5)`, `fib4(6)`, and `fib4(7)`.

3. **Modify for Custom Input**: To compute the Fib4 sequence for a different value of `n`, open `main.py` in a text editor, modify the `print` statements at the bottom of the file with your desired input, and save the file. Then, rerun the code using the command above.

## Example Usage

The following example demonstrates how to use the `fib4` function:

```python
# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(fib4(5))  # Output: 4
    print(fib4(6))  # Output: 8
    print(fib4(7))  # Output: 14
```

This example calculates and prints the 5th, 6th, and 7th elements of the Fib4 sequence.

## Documentation

For further details on the implementation and usage of the `fib4` function, please refer to the comments within the `main.py` file. The code is self-contained and does not require additional libraries or frameworks.
