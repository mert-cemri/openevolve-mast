# Encrypt Function

A simple Python application that provides a function to encrypt strings by rotating the alphabet. This function shifts each letter in the input string down by two multiplied by two places in the alphabet.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this software is to encrypt a given string using a specific rotation of the alphabet. The rotation is defined such that each letter is shifted down by four places in the alphabet. Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.

### Example Usage

- `encrypt('hi')` returns `'lm'`
- `encrypt('asdfghjkl')` returns `'ewhjklnop'`
- `encrypt('gf')` returns `'kj'`
- `encrypt('et')` returns `'ix'`

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to set up and use. You only need to have Python installed on your system.
