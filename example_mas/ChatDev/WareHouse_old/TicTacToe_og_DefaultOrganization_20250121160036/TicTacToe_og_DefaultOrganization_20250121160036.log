Considering the nature of the task, which involves creating a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface for two players, I believe the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This would allow us to implement the game with interactive features and visual elements that enhance the user experience. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree. An "Application" would be the most appropriate modality for a tic-tac-toe game, as it allows for the creation of an interactive and engaging user interface, which is essential for a game involving two players. This format will enable us to implement the necessary game logic and user interactions effectively.

Task: "Design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python *"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python *. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

Here is a new customer's task: Design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface using Python, we will use the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface. The application will consist of a main file that initializes the game and handles the GUI, and a separate module for the game logic.

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **TicTacToeGame**: This class will handle the game logic, including checking for a win or a draw, and updating the game state.
   - `__init__`: Initializes the game board.
   - `make_move`: Updates the board with a player's move.
   - `check_winner`: Checks if there is a winner.
   - `is_draw`: Checks if the game is a draw.
   - `reset_game`: Resets the game board.

2. **TicTacToeGUI**: This class will manage the GUI components and interactions.
   - `__init__`: Sets up the GUI layout.
   - `create_buttons`: Creates the buttons for the tic-tac-toe grid.
   - `button_click`: Handles button click events.
   - `update_status`: Updates the status label with the current game state.
   - `reset_board`: Resets the GUI board for a new game.

### Main File: `main.py`

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The code is mostly well-structured and meets the requirements. However, there is a minor improvement that can enhance the user experience: 

**Comment with Highest Priority:**
The current implementation does not handle the scenario where a player tries to make a move on an already occupied cell. Although the logic prevents overwriting a move, it would be beneficial to provide feedback to the user when they attempt to make an invalid move.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
Add a message to inform the player that the selected cell is already occupied. This can be done by updating the `button_click` method in `TicTacToeGUI` class to include a condition that checks if a cell is already occupied and updates the status label accordingly.

```python
def button_click(self, i, j):
    if self.buttons[i][j]["text"] == "":
        if not self.game.check_winner():
            self.buttons[i][j]["text"] = self.current_player
            self.game.make_move(i, j, self.current_player)
            if self.game.check_winner():
                self.update_status(f"Player {self.current_player} wins!")
            elif self.game.is_draw():
                self.update_status("It's a draw!")
            else:
                self.current_player = "O" if self.current_player == "X" else "X"
                self.update_status(f"Player {self.current_player}'s turn")
    else:
        self.update_status("Cell already occupied! Try a different move.")
```

This change will ensure that the user is informed when they attempt to make an invalid move, enhancing the overall user experience.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is mostly well-structured and meets the requirements. However, there is a minor improvement that can enhance the user experience: 

**Comment with Highest Priority:**
The current implementation does not handle the scenario where a player tries to make a move on an already occupied cell. Although the logic prevents overwriting a move, it would be beneficial to provide feedback to the user when they attempt to make an invalid move.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
Add a message to inform the player that the selected cell is already occupied. This can be done by updating the `button_click` method in `TicTacToeGUI` class to include a condition that checks if a cell is already occupied and updates the status label accordingly.

```python
def button_click(self, i, j):
    if self.buttons[i][j]["text"] == "":
        if not self.game.check_winner():
            self.buttons[i][j]["text"] = self.current_player
            self.game.make_move(i, j, self.current_player)
            if self.game.check_winner():
                self.update_status(f"Player {self.current_player} wins!")
            elif self.game.is_draw():
                self.update_status("It's a draw!")
            else:
                self.current_player = "O" if self.current_player == "X" else "X"
                self.update_status(f"Player {self.current_player}'s turn")
    else:
        self.update_status("Cell already occupied! Try a different move.")
```

This change will ensure that the user is informed when they attempt to make an invalid move, enhancing the overall user experience."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error message you encountered is a `TclError` related to the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces in Python. The specific error message is:

```
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error typically occurs when you are trying to run a Tkinter-based application in an environment that does not have access to a graphical display. This is common when running the application on a remote server or in a headless environment (an environment without a graphical user interface).

Here are the key points to address this issue:

1. **Environment Issue**: The error indicates that the Tkinter library cannot find a display to render the GUI. This is because the `$DISPLAY` environment variable, which is used to specify the display server, is not set. This is common in environments without a graphical interface, such as remote servers or virtual machines without a GUI.

2. **Solution**:
   - **Local Machine**: If you are running this on a local machine with a GUI, ensure that you are executing the script in a terminal that has access to the display server.
   - **Remote Server**: If you are running this on a remote server, you can use X11 forwarding with SSH to run the application. Use the `-X` or `-Y` option with SSH to enable X11 forwarding (e.g., `ssh -X user@remote-server`).
   - **Virtual Environment**: If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is properly configured to access the display server.
   - **Headless Environment**: If you are in a headless environment and cannot use X11 forwarding, consider using a virtual display server like Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to simulate a display.

By addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the issue and run your Tkinter-based Tic-Tac-Toe game successfully.

Error Summary of Test Reports:
"The error message you encountered is a `TclError` related to the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces in Python. The specific error message is:

```
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error typically occurs when you are trying to run a Tkinter-based application in an environment that does not have access to a graphical display. This is common when running the application on a remote server or in a headless environment (an environment without a graphical user interface).

Here are the key points to address this issue:

1. **Environment Issue**: The error indicates that the Tkinter library cannot find a display to render the GUI. This is because the `$DISPLAY` environment variable, which is used to specify the display server, is not set. This is common in environments without a graphical interface, such as remote servers or virtual machines without a GUI.

2. **Solution**:
   - **Local Machine**: If you are running this on a local machine with a GUI, ensure that you are executing the script in a terminal that has access to the display server.
   - **Remote Server**: If you are running this on a remote server, you can use X11 forwarding with SSH to run the application. Use the `-X` or `-Y` option with SSH to enable X11 forwarding (e.g., `ssh -X user@remote-server`).
   - **Virtual Environment**: If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is properly configured to access the display server.
   - **Headless Environment**: If you are in a headless environment and cannot use X11 forwarding, consider using a virtual display server like Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to simulate a display.

By addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the issue and run your Tkinter-based Tic-Tac-Toe game successfully."

Use the -X or -Y option with SSH to enable X11 forwarding (e.g., ssh -X user@remote-server).\n   - Virtual Environment: If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is properly configured to access the display server.\n   - Headless Environment*: If you are in a headless environment and cannot use X11 forwarding, consider using a virtual display server like Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to simulate a display.\n\nBy addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the issue and run your Tkinter-based Tic-Tac-Toe game successfully.'} |

Here is a new customer's task: Design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error message you encountered is a `TclError` related to the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces in Python. The specific error message is:

```
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error typically occurs when you try to run a Tkinter application in an environment that does not have access to a graphical display. This is common in headless environments, such as remote servers or virtual machines without a graphical user interface.

Here's a summary of the issue and potential solutions:

1. **Environment Issue**: The error indicates that the Tkinter library cannot find a display to render the GUI. This is because the `$DISPLAY` environment variable, which tells GUI applications where to render their windows, is not set.

2. **Headless Environment**: If you are running this code on a server or a system without a graphical interface, you will need to either:
   - Run the code on a local machine with a GUI.
   - Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to simulate a display.

3. **Solution**:
   - If you are on a local machine with a GUI, ensure that your display settings are correctly configured.
   - If you are on a headless server, you can install and use Xvfb to create a virtual display. You can start Xvfb with a command like `Xvfb :99 &` and then set the `DISPLAY` environment variable in your terminal session with `export DISPLAY=:99`.

By addressing the environment issue, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the `TclError`.

"The error message you encountered is a `TclError` related to the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces in Python. The specific error message is:

```

This error typically occurs when you try to run a Tkinter application in an environment that does not have access to a graphical display. This is common in headless environments, such as remote servers or virtual machines without a graphical user interface.

Here's a summary of the issue and potential solutions:

1. **Environment Issue**: The error indicates that the Tkinter library cannot find a display to render the GUI. This is because the `$DISPLAY` environment variable, which tells GUI applications where to render their windows, is not set.

2. **Headless Environment**: If you are running this code on a server or a system without a graphical interface, you will need to either:
   - Run the code on a local machine with a GUI.
   - Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to simulate a display.

3. **Solution**:
   - If you are on a local machine with a GUI, ensure that your display settings are correctly configured.
   - If you are on a headless server, you can install and use Xvfb to create a virtual display. You can start Xvfb with a command like `Xvfb :99 &` and then set the `DISPLAY` environment variable in your terminal session with `export DISPLAY=:99`.

By addressing the environment issue, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the `TclError`."

Explanation:
- In `main.py`, I added a check to set the `DISPLAY` environment variable to `:99` if it is not already set. This is useful for running the application in headless environments where a display is not available. This change should help avoid the `TclError` related to the `$DISPLAY` environment variable.

This is common in headless environments, such as remote servers or virtual machines without a graphical user interface.\n\nHere's a summary of the issue and potential solutions:\n\n1. Environment Issue: The error indicates that the Tkinter library cannot find a display to render the GUI. This is because the $DISPLAY environment variable, which tells GUI applications where to render their windows, is not set.\n\n2. Headless Environment: If you are running this code on a server or a system without a graphical interface, you will need to either:\n   - Run the code on a local machine with a GUI.\n   - Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to simulate a display.\n\n3. Solution*:\n   - If you are on a local machine with a GUI, ensure that your display settings are correctly configured.\n   - If you are on a headless server, you can install and use Xvfb to create a virtual display. You can start Xvfb with a command like Xvfb :99 &amp; and then set the DISPLAY environment variable in your terminal session with export DISPLAY=:99.\n\nBy addressing the environment issue, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the TclError."} |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error message you provided indicates a `TclError` related to the inability to connect to a display. This issue typically arises in environments where a graphical user interface (GUI) is attempted to be launched without an available display, such as in headless environments (e.g., servers without a graphical interface).

Here's a summary of the issue and potential solutions:

### Issue:
- **Error Message**: `_tkinter.TclError: couldn't connect to display ":99"`
- **Cause**: The error occurs because the `tkinter` library, which is used to create the GUI for the tic-tac-toe game, is unable to find a display to render the GUI. This is common in environments where there is no graphical display available (e.g., running the script on a remote server without a GUI).

### Potential Solutions:
1. **Ensure a Display is Available**:
   - If you are running the script on a local machine with a GUI, ensure that the display environment variable is correctly set. Typically, this should be `:0` for local displays.
   - If running on a remote server, consider using a tool like `Xvfb` (X Virtual Framebuffer) to create a virtual display.

2. **Modify the Code for Headless Environments**:
   - If the script is intended to run in a headless environment, you can use `Xvfb` to simulate a display. Install `Xvfb` and run it before executing your script:
     ```bash
     Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x16 &
     export DISPLAY=:99
     python main.py
     ```
   - Alternatively, consider running the script in an environment that supports GUI applications, such as a local machine or a virtual machine with a desktop environment.

3. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure that the `DISPLAY` environment variable is correctly set. If you are setting it manually in the script, verify that the value is appropriate for your environment.

By addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the `TclError` and successfully run the tic-tac-toe game with a GUI.

_tkinter.TclError: couldn't connect to display ":99"
"
Error Summary of Test Reports:
"The error message you provided indicates a `TclError` related to the inability to connect to a display. This issue typically arises in environments where a graphical user interface (GUI) is attempted to be launched without an available display, such as in headless environments (e.g., servers without a graphical interface).

Here's a summary of the issue and potential solutions:

### Issue:
- **Error Message**: `_tkinter.TclError: couldn't connect to display ":99"`
- **Cause**: The error occurs because the `tkinter` library, which is used to create the GUI for the tic-tac-toe game, is unable to find a display to render the GUI. This is common in environments where there is no graphical display available (e.g., running the script on a remote server without a GUI).

### Potential Solutions:
1. **Ensure a Display is Available**:
   - If you are running the script on a local machine with a GUI, ensure that the display environment variable is correctly set. Typically, this should be `:0` for local displays.
   - If running on a remote server, consider using a tool like `Xvfb` (X Virtual Framebuffer) to create a virtual display.

2. **Modify the Code for Headless Environments**:
   - If the script is intended to run in a headless environment, you can use `Xvfb` to simulate a display. Install `Xvfb` and run it before executing your script:
     ```bash
     Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x16 &
     export DISPLAY=:99
     python main.py
     ```
   - Alternatively, consider running the script in an environment that supports GUI applications, such as a local machine or a virtual machine with a desktop environment.

3. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure that the `DISPLAY` environment variable is correctly set. If you are setting it manually in the script, verify that the value is appropriate for your environment.

By addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the `TclError` and successfully run the tic-tac-toe game with a GUI."
Note that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary. Now, use the format exemplified above and modify the problematic codes based on the error summary. Output the codes that you fixed based on the test reported and corresponding explanations (strictly follow the format defined above, including FILENAME, LANGUAGE, DOCSTRING and CODE; incomplete "TODO" codes are strictly prohibited). If no bugs are reported, please return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code, the project primarily uses the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface. However, `tkinter` is part of the standard Python library and does not need to be listed in the `requirements.txt` file. The code does not appear to use any additional external libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no additional dependencies required beyond the standard Python installation.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

If you plan to extend the project with additional features that require external libraries, you would list those libraries and their versions in this file.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, the project primarily uses the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface. However, `tkinter` is part of the standard Python library and does not need to be listed in the `requirements.txt` file. The code does not appear to use any additional external libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no additional dependencies required beyond the standard Python installation.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```
If you plan to extend the project with additional features that require external libraries, you would list those libraries and their versions in this file. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: Design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

As the Chief Executive Officer, I understand the importance of ensuring that our project is well-documented and easy to set up for any developer who might work on it in the future. Based on the information provided by the Programmer and the Chief Technology Officer, the current tic-tac-toe project does not require any external Python libraries beyond the standard library, which includes `tkinter`.

Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project will be minimal, as there are no additional dependencies required. However, it's always good practice to include a comment indicating that no external dependencies are needed, to avoid confusion for anyone reviewing the project setup.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file for the tic-tac-toe project:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

If in the future, the project is expanded to include additional features that require external libraries, those libraries and their specific versions should be added to this file. This will ensure that anyone setting up the project can easily install all necessary dependencies using a package manager like `pip`.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

- **Reset Functionality**: Players can reset the board at any time to start a new game.
