# Largest Prime Factor Finder

This software provides a function to determine the largest prime factor of a given integer. It is designed to be simple and efficient, assuming the input number is greater than 1 and not a prime itself.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this software is encapsulated in the `largest_prime_factor` function. This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest prime factor of `n`.

### Function Definition

```python
def largest_prime_factor(n: int):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime."""
```

### Example Usage

```python
print(largest_prime_factor(13195))  # Output: 29
print(largest_prime_factor(2048))   # Output: 2
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies beyond a standard Python environment. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Python Installation**: If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If the code is hosted in a repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Directory**: Move into the directory containing the `main.py` file:
   ```bash
   cd <directory-name>
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the `main.py` script to use the `largest_prime_factor` function. You can modify the script to test different values of `n`.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Modify the Input**: Edit the `main.py` file to change the input value for which you want to find the largest prime factor.

3. **Output**: The script will print the largest prime factor of the given number.

## Documentation

This software is straightforward and does not require extensive documentation. The main focus is on the `largest_prime_factor` function, which is well-commented to explain its logic.
