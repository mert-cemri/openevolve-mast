Given the task is to write a piece of software code that flips the case of characters in a string, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task involves implementing a software tool that processes input data (a string) and produces output (the string with flipped case), which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" is indeed the most suitable product modality for this task, as it involves implementing a software tool to process and manipulate data. Let's proceed with this modality.

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To complete the task, we need to implement the `flip_case` function in Python. This function will take a string as input and flip the case of each character, turning lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase characters to lowercase.

Here is the plan:

1. **Function Name**: `flip_case`
   - **Purpose**: To flip the case of each character in a given string.
   - **Input**: A string.
   - **Output**: A new string with the case of each character flipped.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python

'''

For a given string, flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase.

'''

def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return string.swapcase()

```

This implementation uses Python's built-in `swapcase()` method, which efficiently flips the case of all characters in the string. This approach is concise and leverages Python's standard library for optimal performance.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

For the given task and code, there are no external dependencies or packages required to run the `flip_case` function. The function utilizes Python's built-in string method `swapcase()`, which does not require any additional libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no dependencies to specify.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Flip Case Utility

This utility provides a simple function to flip the case of characters in a given string. It converts lowercase characters to uppercase and vice versa.

## Quick Install

No external dependencies are required for this utility. It is implemented in pure Python, so you only need Python installed on your system to use it.

## 🤔 What is this?

The `flip_case` function is a straightforward utility designed to manipulate the case of characters in a string. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as text processing, data normalization, or simply for fun.

### Main Functionality

- **flip_case(string: str) -> str**: This function takes a string as input and returns a new string with all lowercase characters converted to uppercase and all uppercase characters converted to lowercase.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import flip_case

# Example usage
result = flip_case('Hello')
print(result)  # Output: hELLO
```

## 📖 Documentation

### Getting Started

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: This utility requires Python to be installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or download the repository**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the `flip_case` function.

3. **Run your Python script**: Use the function in your Python scripts as shown in the example above.

### How-To Examples

- **Basic Example**: Flip the case of a simple string.
  ```python
  print(flip_case('Python'))  # Output: pYTHON
  ```

- **Handling Mixed Case Strings**: Works seamlessly with strings containing both uppercase and lowercase characters.
  ```python
  print(flip_case('PyThOn123'))  # Output: pYtHoN123
  ```

### Reference

- **Function Definition**: 
  ```python
  def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
      return string.swapcase()
  ```

This utility is designed to be simple and effective, providing a single function to achieve the desired case flipping functionality without any additional setup or dependencies.
