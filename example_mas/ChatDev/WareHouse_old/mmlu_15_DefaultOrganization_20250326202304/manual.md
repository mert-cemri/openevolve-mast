# Machine Learning Quiz Application

A simple GUI application for testing your knowledge of machine learning concepts through multiple-choice questions.

## Overview

The Machine Learning Quiz Application is designed to provide users with a straightforward interface to answer multiple-choice questions related to machine learning. The application uses the Tkinter library, which is part of the standard Python library, to create a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Main Features

- **Interactive GUI**: The application provides an easy-to-use interface for answering multiple-choice questions.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Users receive instant feedback on whether their answer is correct or incorrect.
- **No External Dependencies**: The application relies solely on the standard Python library, making it easy to set up and run.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the source code to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, install Python from the official website.

3. **Verify Tkinter Installation**: Tkinter is included with Python, but you can verify its installation by running the following command in your Python environment:
   ```python
   python -m tkinter
   ```
   If a small window appears, Tkinter is installed correctly.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory containing `main.py` and execute the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Answer the Question**: The application will display a machine learning-related question with multiple-choice answers. Select the option you believe is correct by clicking the corresponding radio button.

3. **Submit Your Answer**: Click the "Submit" button to check your answer. A message box will appear indicating whether your answer is correct or incorrect.

4. **Feedback**: If your answer is correct, the message box will confirm it. If incorrect, the message box will display the correct answer.

## Troubleshooting

- **GUI Issues**: If you encounter issues with the GUI not displaying, ensure you are running the script in an environment that supports GUI applications.
- **Tkinter Errors**: If you receive errors related to Tkinter, verify that Python and Tkinter are correctly installed.

## Conclusion

The Machine Learning Quiz Application is a simple yet effective tool for testing your knowledge of machine learning concepts. With its easy setup and interactive interface, it provides a quick way to engage with machine learning topics.
