Given the task at hand, which involves writing a function to process a sentence and return words with prime lengths, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task is primarily focused on software code development and does not require visualization or documentation in formats like charts, documents, or presentations. An application can effectively implement the required functionality in Python. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. The task is centered around developing a Python function to process text, which aligns well with the "Application" modality. This approach allows us to focus on the code implementation without the need for additional visualization or documentation. Let's proceed with this modality.

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `words_in_sentence` that extracts words from a given sentence whose lengths are prime numbers. Here's how we can break down the task:

1. **Function `is_prime`:** A helper function to determine if a given number is a prime number. This will be used to check if the length of a word is prime.

2. **Function `words_in_sentence`:** The main function that processes the input sentence, splits it into words, checks each word's length using the `is_prime` function, and constructs a new string with words that have prime lengths.

Now, let's implement the code in a single file named `main.py`.

main.py

```python

'''

This module contains a function to extract words from a sentence whose lengths are prime numbers.

'''

def is_prime(n):
    """
    Check if a number is a prime number.

    Args:

    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    Extract words from a sentence whose lengths are prime numbers.

    Args:
    sentence (str): The input sentence.

    Returns:
    str: A string containing words with prime lengths, in the original order.
    """
    words = sentence.split()
    prime_length_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    return ' '.join(prime_length_words)

```

This code defines the `is_prime` function to check for prime numbers and the `words_in_sentence` function to filter words based on their lengths being prime. The `words_in_sentence` function splits the input sentence into words, checks each word's length, and returns a new string with words that have prime lengths.

" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)
