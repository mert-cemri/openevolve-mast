Given the task at hand, which involves writing a function to convert integers to Roman numerals, the product modality should focus on a format that best suits code delivery and testing. Considering the options, an "Application" modality seems appropriate as it allows us to implement the function in Python and test it effectively. What are your thoughts on this?

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `int_to_mini_roman` that converts a given integer to its Roman numeral equivalent in lowercase. The task specifies that the function should handle numbers from 1 to 1000. Since the task explicitly states not to implement a GUI, we will focus solely on the function implementation.

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Name**: `int_to_mini_roman`
   - **Purpose**: Convert an integer to a Roman numeral string in lowercase.

2. **Roman Numerals Mapping**:
   - We will use a list of tuples to map integer values to their corresponding Roman numeral strings.

3. **Conversion Logic**:
   - Iterate through the mapping, subtracting values from the input number and appending the corresponding Roman numeral to the result string.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python
'''

    roman_numerals = [

```

This code defines the `int_to_mini_roman` function, which converts an integer to its Roman numeral representation in lowercase. The function uses a list of tuples to map integers to Roman numerals and constructs the result by iterating through this list. The code includes example usage to demonstrate the function's correctness.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `int_to_mini_roman` only uses standard Python features and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. Here is how it should look:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not require any additional packages beyond the standard Python library to function correctly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `int_to_mini_roman` only uses standard Python features and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. Here is how it should look:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that the project does not require any additional packages beyond the standard Python library to function correctly. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# int_to_mini_roman

A simple Python module to convert integers to Roman numerals in lowercase.

## Overview

The `int_to_mini_roman` function is designed to convert a given positive integer into its Roman numeral equivalent, represented as a lowercase string. This function is particularly useful for applications that require Roman numeral representations for numbers ranging from 1 to 1000.

## Features

- Convert integers to Roman numerals in lowercase.
- Supports integer values from 1 to 1000.
- No external dependencies required.

## Installation

Since this module does not require any external dependencies, you can directly use the provided `main.py` file in your Python environment. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Steps to Install Python

1. **Download Python:**
   - Visit the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
   - Download the latest version of Python for your operating system.

2. **Install Python:**
   - Follow the installation instructions provided on the Python website for your specific operating system.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Type `python --version` to verify that Python is installed correctly.

## Usage

To use the `int_to_mini_roman` function, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**
   - Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file to your local machine.

2. **Run the Function:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.
   - Run the Python interpreter and import the function:
     ```bash
     python
     >>> from main import int_to_mini_roman
     >>> print(int_to_mini_roman(19))  # Output: 'xix'
     >>> print(int_to_mini_roman(152)) # Output: 'clii'
     >>> print(int_to_mini_roman(426)) # Output: 'cdxxvi'
     ```

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the `int_to_mini_roman` function:

- Convert 19 to Roman numeral:
  ```python
  >>> int_to_mini_roman(19)
  'xix'
  ```

- Convert 152 to Roman numeral:
