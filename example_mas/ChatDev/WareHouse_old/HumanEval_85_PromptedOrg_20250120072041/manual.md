# Add Function

This software provides a simple utility function to sum even integers located at odd indices in a given list. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, with no external dependencies required.

## Main Functionality

The primary function of this software is:

- **add(lst):** This function takes a non-empty list of integers as input and returns the sum of the even integers that are located at odd indices in the list.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example
result = add([4, 2, 6, 7])
print(result)  # Output: 2
```

In this example, the function `add` processes the list `[4, 2, 6, 7]`. It identifies that the number `2` is an even number located at an odd index (index 1), and thus returns `2` as the sum.

## Installation

This software does not require any external libraries or dependencies, making it straightforward to use. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.
