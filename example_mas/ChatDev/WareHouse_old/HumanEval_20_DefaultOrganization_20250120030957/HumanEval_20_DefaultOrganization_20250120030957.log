Given the task at hand, which involves writing software code to solve a specific problem, the most suitable product modality would likely be an "Application." This is because the task requires implementing a functional piece of software, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To complete the task, we need to implement the function `find_closest_elements` in Python. The function should find and return the two closest numbers from a list. Since the task explicitly states not to implement a GUI, we will focus solely on the logic required to solve the problem. Let's outline the necessary function and then provide the implementation.

### Core Function

- **find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]**: This function will iterate through the list of numbers, calculate the difference between each pair, and return the pair with the smallest difference.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

#### main.py

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).
    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
    (2.0, 2.2)
    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
    (2.0, 2.0)
    """
    # Sort the numbers to ensure the closest elements are adjacent
    numbers.sort()
    # Initialize the minimum difference to a large number
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (numbers[0], numbers[1])
    
    # Iterate through the sorted list to find the closest pair
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        diff = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i], numbers[i + 1])
    
    return closest_pair
```

This code sorts the list of numbers and then iterates through the sorted list to find the pair of numbers with the smallest difference. The pair is returned in the order of the smaller number first. This implementation is efficient and meets the requirements specified in the task description.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages used that require specification in a `requirements.txt` file. The code only uses Python's built-in functions and types, which do not require additional dependencies. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

If you plan to add any additional functionality that requires external libraries in the future, you can update the `requirements.txt` file accordingly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages used that require specification in a `requirements.txt` file. The code only uses Python's built-in functions and types, which do not require additional dependencies. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty.
Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
If you plan to add any additional functionality that requires external libraries in the future, you can update the `requirements.txt` file accordingly. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I agree with the Programmer's assessment. The current implementation of the `find_closest_elements` function in `main.py` does not utilize any external libraries or packages that would necessitate entries in a `requirements.txt` file. The function relies solely on Python's built-in capabilities.

Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would indeed be empty, as there are no additional dependencies required for the code to function properly. Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

If any future enhancements or additional functionalities are introduced that require external libraries, the `requirements.txt` file should be updated to include those dependencies.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
