Given the task at hand, which is to write a function to determine if a number is prime, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task involves implementing a software tool or function, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts on this?

To solve the task, we need to implement the `is_prime` function in Python. This function will determine if a given number is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can implement this:

1. **Check if the number is less than or equal to 1:** If so, it's not prime.
2. **Check if the number is 2:** 2 is the only even prime number.
3. **Check if the number is even:** If it's even and greater than 2, it's not prime.
4. **Check for factors up to the square root of the number:** If any number divides it evenly, it's not prime.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python
'''

This module contains a function to determine if a number is prime.

'''

def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.
    
    >>> is_prime(6)
    False
    >>> is_prime(101)
    True
    >>> is_prime(11)
    True
    >>> is_prime(13441)
    True
    >>> is_prime(61)
    True
    >>> is_prime(4)
    False
    >>> is_prime(1)
    False
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This code implements the `is_prime` function as described. It checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, if it is 2, if it is even, and then checks for factors up to the square root of the number. This ensures that the function is efficient and works correctly for the test cases provided.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

# Prime Number Checker

This software module provides a function to determine if a given number is prime. It is designed to be simple and efficient, with no external dependencies required.

## Main Function

The main function provided by this module is `is_prime(n)`, which checks if a number `n` is a prime number.

### Function Definition

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.
    >>> is_prime(6)
    False
    >>> is_prime(101)
    True
    >>> is_prime(11)
    True
    >>> is_prime(13441)
    True
    >>> is_prime(61)
    True
    >>> is_prime(4)
    False
    >>> is_prime(1)
    False
    """
```

### How It Works

- The function first checks if the number `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns `False` since numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.
- If `n` is 2, the function returns `True` because 2 is the smallest and only even prime number.
- If `n` is even and greater than 2, the function returns `False` because even numbers greater than 2 are not prime.
- For odd numbers greater than 2, the function checks divisibility from 3 up to the square root of `n`. If any divisor is found, it returns `False`. If no divisors are found, it returns `True`.

## Installation

This module does not require any external dependencies. You can simply download the `main.py` file and use it in your Python environment.

## Usage

1. **Download the Code**: Ensure you have the `main.py` file in your working directory.

2. **Import the Function**: In your Python script or interactive shell, import the `is_prime` function.

   ```python
   from main import is_prime
   ```

3. **Check Prime Numbers**: Use the `is_prime` function to check if a number is prime.

   ```python
   print(is_prime(6))    # Output: False
   print(is_prime(101))  # Output: True
   print(is_prime(11))   # Output: True
   ```

## Testing

You can test the function using the provided examples in the docstring. Simply run the function with different inputs to verify its correctness.

## Conclusion

This module provides a straightforward and efficient way to check for prime numbers in Python. It is designed to be easy to use and integrate into other projects without the need for additional libraries or dependencies.

    >>> is_prime(11)
    True
    >>> is_prime(13441)
    True
    >>> is_prime(61)
    True
    >>> is_prime(4)
    False
    >>> is_prime(1)
    False
    """
```

### How It Works

- The function first checks if the number `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns `False` since numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.
- If `n` is 2, the function returns `True` because 2 is the smallest and only even prime number.

- For odd numbers greater than 2, the function checks divisibility from 3 up to the square root of `n`. If any divisor is found, it returns `False`. If no divisors are found, it returns `True`.

## Usage

1. **Download the Code**: Ensure you have the `main.py` file in your working directory.

2. **Import the Function**: In your Python script or interactive shell, import the `is_prime` function.

   ```python
   from main import is_prime
   ```

3. **Check Prime Numbers**: Use the `is_prime` function to check if a number is prime.

   ```python
   print(is_prime(6))    # Output: False
   print(is_prime(101))  # Output: True
   print(is_prime(11))   # Output: True
   ```
