Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and testing a piece of software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to focus on the implementation and functionality of the code without the need for additional presentation or visualization features. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree. An "Application" is the most appropriate modality for this task as it focuses on the core functionality of writing and testing the software code. This aligns with the customer's requirements and our company's objectives. Let's proceed with this modality.

To solve the task, we need to implement the `simplify` function that checks if the product of two fractions results in a whole number. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Parse the Fractions**: Convert the string representation of fractions into numerators and denominators.
2. **Multiply the Fractions**: Multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.
3. **Check for Whole Number**: Determine if the resulting fraction is a whole number by checking if the numerator is divisible by the denominator without a remainder.

Now, let's implement the code in a single file named `main.py`.

    result_num = x_num * n_num
    result_den = x_den * n_den

# Example usage
print(simplify("1/5", "5/1"))  # True

print(simplify("7/10", "10/2"))  # False
```

This code defines the `simplify` function, which takes two string representations of fractions, multiplies them, and checks if the result is a whole number. The function returns `True` if the product is a whole number and `False` otherwise.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# Simplify Function

This software provides a simple utility function to determine if the product of two fractions results in a whole number. It is designed to be lightweight and requires no external dependencies.

## Quick Install

Since this project does not require any external libraries, there is no need for installation of dependencies. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## 🤔 What is this?

The `simplify` function is a utility that takes two fractions as input, multiplies them, and checks if the result is a whole number. This can be useful in mathematical computations where you need to verify the integrity of fractional multiplications.

### Main Functionality

- **simplify(x, n)**: This function takes two string inputs, `x` and `n`, each representing a fraction in the format `<numerator>/<denominator>`. It returns `True` if the product of these fractions is a whole number, and `False` otherwise.

### Example Usage

```python
# Import the function from the module
from main import simplify

# Example calls
print(simplify("1/5", "5/1"))  # Output: True
print(simplify("1/6", "2/1"))  # Output: False
print(simplify("7/10", "10/2"))  # Output: False
```

## 📖 Documentation

### Function Details

- **simplify(x, n)**
  - **Parameters**:
    - `x` (str): A string representing a fraction in the format `<numerator>/<denominator>`.
    - `n` (str): A string representing a fraction in the format `<numerator>/<denominator>`.
  - **Returns**: 
    - `bool`: `True` if the product of the fractions is a whole number, `False` otherwise.

### How It Works

1. **Parsing Fractions**: The function splits each fraction string into numerator and denominator using the `/` character.
2. **Multiplying Fractions**: It multiplies the numerators together and the denominators together to get the resulting fraction.
3. **Checking Whole Number**: It checks if the resulting numerator is divisible by the resulting denominator without a remainder.

This function is straightforward and efficient for simple fraction multiplication checks.

## Getting Started

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: This script requires Python to run. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Run the script**: Use a Python environment to execute the script and test the `simplify` function with various inputs.

This utility is designed to be simple and effective for basic mathematical checks involving fractions.
