As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `max_fill` that calculates the number of times buckets need to be lowered to empty the wells in a grid. The function will iterate through the grid, count the number of water units (represented by 1s), and divide this count by the bucket capacity to determine the number of bucket operations needed.

Here's the breakdown of the core function:

1. **Function `max_fill(grid, capacity)`**: This function will:
   - Iterate through each row in the grid.
   - Count the total number of water units (1s) in the grid.
   - Calculate the number of times the bucket needs to be lowered by dividing the total water units by the bucket capacity, using the ceiling function to ensure all water is collected.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

main.py

```python

'''

and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.

        bucket_capacity : 2
    Output: 5

Example 3:
    Input: 
        grid : [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]]
        bucket_capacity : 5
    Output: 0

Constraints:
    * all wells have the same length
    * 1 <= grid.length <= 10^2
    * 1 <= grid[:,1].length <= 10^2
    * grid[i][j] -> 0 | 1

'''

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math
    total_water_units = 0
    
    # Count the total number of water units in the grid
    for row in grid:

    # Calculate the number of times the bucket needs to be lowered
    num_operations = math.ceil(total_water_units / capacity)
    
    return num_operations

This code will correctly calculate the number of times the buckets need to be lowered to empty all the wells in the grid, based on the given bucket capacity.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Since the provided code does not use any external libraries or packages, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty. The code relies solely on Python's built-in functionality, so no additional dependencies are needed.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
```
This indicates that there are no external dependencies required for the project. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Max Fill User Manual

## Introduction

The `max_fill` function is a Python utility designed to calculate the number of times a bucket needs to be lowered to empty a grid of wells. Each well is represented by a row in a grid, where each '1' indicates a unit of water. The function takes into account the capacity of the bucket to determine the total number of operations required to empty all the wells.

## Main Function

### `max_fill(grid, capacity)`

- **Purpose**: Calculate the number of times a bucket needs to be lowered to empty all the water units in a grid of wells.
- **Parameters**:
  - `grid`: A list of lists, where each sublist represents a row of wells, and each element is either `0` (no water) or `1` (one unit of water).
  - `capacity`: An integer representing the capacity of the bucket, i.e., how many units of water it can hold at once.
- **Returns**: An integer representing the number of times the bucket needs to be lowered to empty all the wells.

## Installation

To use the `max_fill` function, you need to have Python installed on your system. The function does not require any additional dependencies beyond the standard Python library.

### Quick Install

1. **Python Installation**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or Download the Script**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the `max_fill` function. You can clone the repository or download the file directly.

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Environment**: Make sure Python is installed and accessible from your command line or terminal.

2. **Run the Script**: You can execute the script by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Example Usage**: You can test the function by calling it with different inputs. For example:

   ```python
   grid = [[0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1]]
   capacity = 1
   print(max_fill(grid, capacity))  # Output: 6
   ```

   This example calculates the number of times the bucket needs to be lowered for a grid with a bucket capacity of 1.

## Documentation

For further details on how the function works, refer to the comments within the `main.py` file. The function is straightforward and leverages Python's built-in capabilities to perform the necessary calculations efficiently.

## Support
