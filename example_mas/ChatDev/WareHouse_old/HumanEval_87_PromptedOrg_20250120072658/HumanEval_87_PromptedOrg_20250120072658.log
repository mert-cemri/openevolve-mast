As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To solve the task, we only need to implement the function `get_row` in a single file, as the task is straightforward and does not require multiple files or classes. The function will iterate over the nested lists, find the occurrences of the integer `x`, and return a list of tuples representing the coordinates. The coordinates will be sorted by rows in ascending order and by columns in descending order within each row.

Here is the implementation:

main.py

```python

'''

This module contains the function get_row which finds all occurrences of a specified integer
in a 2D list and returns their coordinates sorted by specified criteria.

'''

def get_row(lst, x):
    """

    ], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]
    get_row([], 1) == []
    get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]
    """
    coordinates = []
    
    for row_index, row in enumerate(lst):
        for col_index, value in enumerate(row):
            if value == x:
                coordinates.append((row_index, col_index))
    
    # Sort by row index ascending, then by column index descending
    coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))
    
    return coordinates

```

This implementation iterates through each element in the nested list, checks if it matches the target integer `x`, and appends the coordinate to the list. After collecting all coordinates, it sorts them by the specified criteria and returns the sorted list.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Code Reviewer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to review and assess source code written by programmers. You ensure code quality by identifying bugs, optimizing performance, and enforcing coding standards. You provide constructive feedback to improve software robustness.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and work closely with programmers.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# User Manual for `get_row` Function

## Introduction

The `get_row` function is a Python utility designed to search for a specified integer within a 2D list (nested lists) and return the coordinates of its occurrences. The coordinates are returned as a list of tuples, sorted by specific criteria: primarily by row index in ascending order, and secondarily by column index in descending order.

## Main Functionality

- **Function Name**: `get_row`
- **Purpose**: To find all occurrences of a specified integer in a 2D list and return their coordinates.
- **Input**:
  - `lst`: A 2D list (list of lists) where each sublist represents a row.
  - `x`: An integer to search for within the 2D list.
- **Output**: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents the coordinates (row index, column index) of an occurrence of `x`.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example 1
result = get_row([
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6],
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
], 1)
print(result)  # Output: [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]

# Example 2
result = get_row([], 1)
print(result)  # Output: []

# Example 3
result = get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3)
print(result)  # Output: [(2, 2)]
```

## Installation

This function is implemented in pure Python and does not require any external libraries or dependencies. Therefore, there is no need for a `requirements.txt` file or any package installations.

## How to Use

1. **Copy the Code**: Copy the `get_row` function code into your Python script or interactive environment.

2. **Call the Function**: Use the function by passing a 2D list and the integer you want to search for as arguments.

3. **Process the Output**: The function will return a list of tuples representing the coordinates of the integer in the 2D list, sorted by the specified criteria.

## Additional Information

- **Sorting Criteria**: The function sorts the coordinates first by row index in ascending order and then by column index in descending order. This ensures that results are organized in a way that prioritizes row order while listing column indices from right to left within each row.

- **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as empty lists or rows gracefully, returning an empty list if no occurrences are found.

This utility is simple yet effective for applications that require locating and organizing occurrences of a specific value within irregularly shaped 2D data structures.
