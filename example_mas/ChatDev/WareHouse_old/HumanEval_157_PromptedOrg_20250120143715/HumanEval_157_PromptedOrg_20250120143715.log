Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and verifying a piece of software code, the most appropriate product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to focus on the functionality and correctness of the code without the need for additional presentation or visualization layers. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree. An "Application" is the most suitable modality for this task as it focuses on implementing and testing the code functionality directly. This aligns well with the customer's request to write and verify the software code. Let's proceed with this modality.

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)` that checks if the given sides form a right-angled triangle. The function will use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Here's the plan:

1. **Function `right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)`**: This function will take three arguments representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle. It will determine if these sides can form a right-angled triangle by checking the Pythagorean theorem for all permutations of the sides.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

main.py

```python

'''

Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
90 degree.
Example:
right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False

'''

def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    # Sort the sides to ensure the largest is considered as the hypotenuse
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    # Check the Pythagorean theorem
    return sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2

```

This code sorts the sides of the triangle and checks if the sum of the squares of the two smaller sides equals the square of the largest side, which is the condition for a right-angled triangle according to the Pythagorean theorem.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `right_angle_triangle` only uses basic Python operations and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for the sake of completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not require any additional packages beyond the standard Python library.

# Right Angle Triangle Checker

This software provides a simple function to determine if three given side lengths can form a right-angled triangle. It uses the Pythagorean theorem to verify if the triangle is right-angled.

## Main Function

The main function provided by this software is `right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)`. This function takes three arguments, which are the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and returns `True` if these sides form a right-angled triangle, and `False` otherwise.

### Function Definition

```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''
    # Sort the sides to ensure the largest is considered as the hypotenuse
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    # Check the Pythagorean theorem
    return sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it simple and easy to use. You can directly use the function in your Python environment.

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.

3. **Run the Function**: You can use the function directly in a Python script or an interactive Python session.

## Usage

To use the `right_angle_triangle` function, simply call it with three numerical arguments representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle. For example:

```python
print(right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5))  # Output: True
print(right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3))  # Output: False
```

## How It Works

The function works by first sorting the three side lengths to ensure the largest is considered as the hypotenuse. It then checks if the sum of the squares of the two smaller sides equals the square of the largest side, as per the Pythagorean theorem. If this condition is met, the function returns `True`, indicating that the sides form a right-angled triangle.

## Documentation

For further information and examples, please refer to the comments within the code. The function is straightforward and designed to be easily integrated into larger projects or used standalone for quick checks.
