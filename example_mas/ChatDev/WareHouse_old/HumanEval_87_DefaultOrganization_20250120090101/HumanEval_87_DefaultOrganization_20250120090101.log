Given the task at hand, which involves writing a piece of software code to solve a specific problem, I believe the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a functional piece of software, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts on this?

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To solve the task, we need to implement the function `get_row` in Python. The function will take a nested list and an integer `x`, and return a list of tuples representing the coordinates of `x` in the list. The coordinates should be sorted by rows in ascending order and by columns in descending order within each row.

Since the task specifies not to implement a GUI and only requires the necessary code for the function, we will focus solely on the logic for `get_row`.

### Core Function

- **Function Name**: `get_row`
  - **Purpose**: To find all occurrences of an integer `x` in a nested list and return their coordinates sorted as specified.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

#### main.py

[2025-20-01 09:01:21 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 To solve the task, we need to implement the function `get_row` in Python. The function will take a nested list and an integer `x`, and return a list of tuples representing the coordinates of `x` in the list. The coordinates should be sorted by rows in ascending order and by columns in descending order within each row.

Since the task specifies not to implement a GUI and only requires the necessary code for the function, we will focus solely on the logic for `get_row`.

### Core Function

- **Function Name**: `get_row`
  - **Purpose**: To find all occurrences of an integer `x` in a nested list and return their coordinates sorted as specified.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

#### main.py

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The function `get_row` operates solely with Python's built-in data structures and functions. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no additional dependencies needed.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

```

As the Chief Executive Officer, I concur with the Programmer's assessment. The `get_row` function in `main.py` does not utilize any external libraries or packages, as it relies solely on Python's built-in capabilities. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project should indeed be empty, indicating that there are no additional dependencies required for the project to function correctly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# get_row Function

This software module provides a Python function `get_row` that is designed to find all occurrences of a specified integer within a nested list (2D list) and return their coordinates. The coordinates are sorted by rows in ascending order and by columns in descending order within each row.

## Main Functionality

### get_row(lst, x)

- **Description**: 
  - The `get_row` function takes a nested list `lst` and an integer `x` as inputs. It searches for all occurrences of `x` in the nested list and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple represents the coordinates of `x` in the format `(row_index, column_index)`.
  - The coordinates are sorted such that they are initially ordered by rows in ascending order. Within each row, the coordinates are sorted by columns in descending order.

- **Parameters**:
  - `lst`: A list of lists (nested list) where each sublist represents a row.
  - `x`: An integer to search for within the nested list.

- **Returns**: 
  - A list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the row and column indices of `x` in the nested list.

- **Example Usage**:
  ```python
  result = get_row([
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6],
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
  ], 1)
  print(result)  # Output: [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]
  ```

## Installation
