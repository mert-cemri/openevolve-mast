# String Sequence Generator

This software provides a simple function to generate a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to a given number `n` inclusive. It is implemented in Python and is designed to be straightforward and easy to use.

## Main Function

The main function provided by this software is `string_sequence(n: int) -> str`. This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string of numbers starting from 0 up to `n`, separated by spaces.

### Example Usage

```python
>>> string_sequence(0)
'0'
>>> string_sequence(5)
'0 1 2 3 4 5'
```

## Installation

To use this software, you need to have Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
