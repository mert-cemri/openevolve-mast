# String Comparison Evaluator

Welcome to the String Comparison Evaluator! This software is designed to help users evaluate multiple-choice questions related to string comparisons, specifically focusing on the order of strings based on their alphabetical precedence. The application is built using Python and Tkinter for the graphical user interface.

## Main Functions

The main function of this software is to evaluate a given multiple-choice question about string comparisons and determine the correct answer based on user input. The application allows users to input three strings and then evaluates the conditions provided in the question to identify which one is true.

## Quick Install

This application does not require any external dependencies beyond Python and Tkinter, which is included with standard Python installations. To get started, ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the project files to your local machine.

3. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file and execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Launch the Application**: Run the `main.py` script to open the String Comparison Evaluator window.

2. **Input Strings**: Enter the strings you wish to compare in the provided input fields labeled "String A", "String B", and "String C".

3. **Evaluate the Question**: Click the "Evaluate" button to process the input strings and determine the correct answer based on the predefined conditions.

4. **View the Result**: A message box will display the result, indicating which condition is true and providing the index of the correct answer in the format "The answer is (X)".

## Example Usage

Suppose you want to evaluate the following strings:

- String A: "CARROT"
- String B: "Carrot"
- String C: "car"

Enter these values into the respective input fields and click "Evaluate". The application will compare the strings and display the correct answer based on the conditions provided in the question.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Valid Condition Met**: If the application displays an error message stating "No valid condition met", ensure that the strings are entered correctly and that they match the expected format for the question.

- **Application Not Launching**: Verify that Python is installed correctly and that you are running the `main.py` script from the correct directory.
