Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and fixing a piece of software code, I believe the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to focus on the functional aspect of the code without any additional presentation layers. What are your thoughts?

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

    """
".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

    """
.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To complete the task, we need to focus on the core functionality described in the task: adding the even elements that are at odd indices in a list. The task explicitly states not to implement a GUI, so we will only focus on the necessary code to achieve the desired functionality.

Let's break down the task:

1. **Function Name**: `add`
2. **Purpose**: To sum even integers located at odd indices in a given list.
3. **Input**: A non-empty list of integers.
4. **Output**: An integer representing the sum of even numbers at odd indices.

Now, let's implement the function in `main.py`.

MAIN.PY

```python

'''

Given a non-empty list of integers lst, add the even elements that are at odd indices.

Examples:
    add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 2 

'''

def add(lst):
    return sum(lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 == 0)

```

This code defines the `add` function, which iterates over the list `lst`, starting from index 1 (the first odd index) and stepping by 2 to access all odd indices. It checks if the element at each odd index is even, and if so, adds it to the sum. The function then returns the total sum. This solution is efficient and directly addresses the task requirements.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given task and code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code provided is a simple function that utilizes Python's built-in capabilities and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I agree with the Programmer's assessment. The provided code for the task is straightforward and does not require any external libraries or packages beyond Python's standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, as there are no additional dependencies needed for the project to function correctly.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

# Add Function

This software provides a simple utility function to sum even integers located at odd indices in a list. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, with no external dependencies required.

## Quick Install

Since there are no external dependencies, you can directly use the function in your Python environment. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## 🤔 What is this?

The `add` function is a utility that processes a list of integers and returns the sum of even numbers that are located at odd indices. This can be particularly useful in data processing tasks where such specific conditions need to be met.

### Main Functionality

- **add(lst):** This function takes a non-empty list of integers as input and returns the sum of even integers that are located at odd indices in the list.

### Example

```python
# Example usage of the add function
result = add([4, 2, 6, 7])
print(result)  # Output: 2
```

## How to Use

1. **Prepare your environment:**
   - Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Use the function:**
   - Copy the function code into your Python script or interactive environment.
   - Call the `add` function with a list of integers as shown in the example above.

3. **Run your script:**
   - Execute your script to see the results.

## Documentation

For further details on Python and list operations, refer to the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/).
