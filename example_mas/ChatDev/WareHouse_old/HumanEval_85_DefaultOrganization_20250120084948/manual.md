# Add Function

This software provides a simple utility function to sum even integers located at odd indices in a list. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, with no external dependencies required.

## Quick Install

Since there are no external dependencies, you can directly use the function in your Python environment. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## 🤔 What is this?

The `add` function is a utility that processes a list of integers and returns the sum of even numbers that are located at odd indices. This can be particularly useful in data processing tasks where such specific conditions need to be met.

### Main Functionality

- **add(lst):** This function takes a non-empty list of integers as input and returns the sum of even integers that are located at odd indices in the list.

### Example

```python
# Example usage of the add function
result = add([4, 2, 6, 7])
print(result)  # Output: 2
```

## How to Use

1. **Prepare your environment:**
   - Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Use the function:**
   - Copy the function code into your Python script or interactive environment.
   - Call the `add` function with a list of integers as shown in the example above.

3. **Run your script:**
   - Execute your script to see the results.
