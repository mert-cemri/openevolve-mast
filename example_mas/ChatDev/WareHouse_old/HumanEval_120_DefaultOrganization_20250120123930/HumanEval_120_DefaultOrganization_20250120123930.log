To solve the task as specified by the customer, we need to implement the function `maximum` in Python. The task does not require a GUI, despite the mention in your message. The primary focus is to ensure the function works correctly according to the given examples and constraints.

Here's the plan for the function:

1. **Function Name**: `maximum`
2. **Parameters**:
   - `arr`: A list of integers.
   - `k`: A positive integer representing the number of maximum elements to return.
3. **Purpose**: To return a sorted list of the top `k` maximum numbers from the array `arr`.
4. **Steps**:
   - Sort the array in descending order.
   - Slice the first `k` elements from the sorted array.
   - Sort these `k` elements in ascending order before returning them.

Now, let's implement the function in a single Python file named `main.py`.

MAIN.PY

```python
'''

Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list 
of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.

Example 1:

    Input: arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3
    Output: [-4, -3, 5]

Example 2:

    Input: arr = [4, -4, 4], k = 2
    Output: [4, 4]

Example 3:

    Input: arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1
    Output: [2]

Note:
    1. The length of the array will be in the range of [1, 1000].
    2. The elements in the array will be in the range of [-1000, 1000].
    3. 0 <= k <= len(arr)

'''

def maximum(arr, k):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list 
    of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.
    """
    # Sort the array in descending order
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    
    # Get the first k elements
    max_k_elements = sorted_arr[:k]
    
    # Sort these k elements in ascending order
    return sorted(max_k_elements)

# Example usage:
# print(maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3))  # Output: [-4, -3, 5]
# print(maximum([4, -4, 4], 2))   # Output: [4, 4]
# print(maximum([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1))  # Output: [2]
```

This code implements the `maximum` function as required, ensuring it returns the correct results for the given examples. The function first sorts the array in descending order to easily access the largest elements, then slices the top `k` elements and sorts them in ascending order before returning.

```

This code implements the `maximum` function as required, ensuring it returns the correct results for the given examples. The function first sorts the array in descending order to easily access the largest elements, then slices the top `k` elements and sorts them in ascending order before returning.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The function `maximum` only relies on Python's built-in functions, which means there are no additional dependencies required for this project. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

# Maximum K Elements Finder

This software provides a simple utility function to find the maximum `k` elements from a given list of integers. The function returns these elements sorted in ascending order.

## Main Functionality

The primary function of this software is:

- **maximum(arr, k):** This function takes an array `arr` of integers and a positive integer `k`, and returns a sorted list of length `k` containing the maximum `k` numbers from `arr`.

### Example Usage

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `arr = [-3, -4, 5]`, `k = 3`
   - Output: `[-4, -3, 5]`

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `arr = [4, -4, 4]`, `k = 2`
   - Output: `[4, 4]`

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1]`, `k = 1`
   - Output: `[2]`

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to use. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash

3. **Run the script:**
   You can directly run the `main.py` script using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

To use the `maximum` function, you can call it with your desired array and the number `k` as follows:

```python
from main import maximum

# Example usage
arr = [4, -4, 4]
k = 2
result = maximum(arr, k)
print(result)  # Output: [4, 4]
```
