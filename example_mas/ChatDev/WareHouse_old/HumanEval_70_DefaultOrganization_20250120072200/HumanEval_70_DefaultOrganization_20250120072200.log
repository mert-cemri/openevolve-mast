Given the task at hand, which involves writing a piece of software code to solve a specific problem, I believe the most suitable product modality would be an "Application." This is because the task requires implementing a functional piece of software, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, we need to implement the `strange_sort_list` function in Python. The task specifies that we should not implement a GUI, so we will focus solely on the function implementation. Here's the plan:

### Core Function
- **strange_sort_list(lst)**: This function will take a list of integers and return a new list sorted in a "strange" order, where the smallest element is followed by the largest of the remaining elements, then the next smallest, and so on.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python

'''

Given list of integers, return list in strange order.
Strange sorting, is when you start with the minimum value,
then maximum of the remaining integers, then minimum and so on.

Examples:
strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 4, 2, 3]
strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5, 5, 5, 5]
strange_sort_list([]) == []

'''

def strange_sort_list(lst):
    result = []
    lst = sorted(lst)
    while lst:
        result.append(lst.pop(0))  # Append the smallest element
        if lst:
            result.append(lst.pop(-1))  # Append the largest element
    return result

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: [1, 4, 2, 3]
    print(strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5]))  # Output: [5, 5, 5, 5]
    print(strange_sort_list([]))            # Output: []

```

This code defines the `strange_sort_list` function, which sorts the list in the specified "strange" order. The function first sorts the list, then alternates between appending the smallest and largest remaining elements to the result list until all elements are used. The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how the function works with different inputs.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The function `strange_sort_list` only utilizes basic Python operations and built-in functions. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as no additional dependencies are needed.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

```
```

This indicates that the project does not require any external Python packages to run properly.

.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.

Chief Technology Officer: The new user's task and our developed codes are listed:

"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The function `strange_sort_list` only utilizes basic Python operations and built-in functions. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as no additional dependencies are needed.
Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

As the Programmer correctly identified, the code in `main.py` does not utilize any external libraries or packages. It only uses basic Python operations and built-in functions. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would indeed be empty, as no additional dependencies are needed.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Strange Sort List

This software provides a function to sort a list of integers in a "strange" order. The strange sorting starts with the minimum value, then the maximum of the remaining integers, then the next minimum, and so on.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `strange_sort_list(lst)`. This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list sorted in the specified strange order.

### Function Definition

```python
def strange_sort_list(lst):
    '''
    Given list of integers, return list in strange order.
    Strange sorting, is when you start with the minimum value,
    then maximum of the remaining integers, then minimum and so on.

    Examples:
    strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 4, 2, 3]
    strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5, 5, 5, 5]
    strange_sort_list([]) == []
    '''
    result = []
    lst = sorted(lst)
    while lst:
        result.append(lst.pop(0))  # Append the smallest element
        if lst:
            result.append(lst.pop(-1))  # Append the largest element
    return result
```

## Installation

There are no external dependencies required for this software, so you can directly use the function in your Python environment.

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have access to the repository, clone it to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change into the directory where the `main.py` file is located.

   ```bash
   cd <directory-name>
   ```

3. **Run the Function**: You can use the function directly in your Python scripts or interactive environment.

   ```python
   from main import strange_sort_list

   # Example usage
   print(strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: [1, 4, 2, 3]
   ```

## Usage

To use the `strange_sort_list` function, simply pass a list of integers to it. The function will return a new list sorted in the strange order described.

### Examples
