To complete the task, we need to implement the function `count_distinct_characters` in Python. This function will count the number of distinct characters in a given string, ignoring case differences. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we will implement this:

1. **Function Name**: `count_distinct_characters`
   - **Purpose**: To count the number of distinct characters in a string, regardless of their case.

2. **Parameters**:
   - `string`: A string input from which distinct characters are to be counted.

3. **Return Value**:
   - An integer representing the number of distinct characters in the input string.

4. **Logic**:
   - Convert the string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity.
   - Use a set to store characters, as sets automatically handle duplicates.
   - Return the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct characters.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

DOCSTRING

This module contains a function to count the number of distinct characters in a string, ignoring case.

'''

def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """ Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) it consists of.
    
    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
    3
    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
    4
    """
    # Convert the string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity
    lower_string = string.lower()
    
    # Use a set to store distinct characters
    distinct_characters = set(lower_string)
    
    # Return the number of distinct characters
    return len(distinct_characters)
```

This code will correctly count the number of distinct characters in a string, ignoring the case, as required by the task.

6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)
