# String Sequence Generator

A simple Python application to generate a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to a given number `n` inclusive.

## Main Functionality

The primary function of this software is to generate a sequence of numbers in string format. The function `string_sequence(n: int) -> str` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string of numbers starting from 0 up to `n`, separated by spaces.

### Example Usage

- `string_sequence(0)` returns `'0'`
- `string_sequence(5)` returns `'0 1 2 3 4 5'`
