To solve the task, we need to implement the `specialFilter` function in Python. This function will take an array of numbers as input and return the count of numbers that are greater than 10 and have both the first and last digits as odd numbers.

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Name**: `specialFilter`
   - **Purpose**: To filter numbers based on the criteria specified and return the count of such numbers.

2. **Logic**:
   - Iterate over each number in the input list.
   - Check if the number is greater than 10.
   - Convert the number to a string to easily access the first and last digits.
   - Check if both the first and last digits are odd.
   - Count the numbers that meet all the criteria.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module defines the specialFilter function which filters numbers based on specific criteria.

def specialFilter(nums):
    """Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns 
    the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both 
    first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
    For example:
    specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]) => 1 
    specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]) => 2
    """
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            num_str = str(num)
            first_digit = int(num_str[0])
            last_digit = int(num_str[-1])
            if first_digit % 2 != 0 and last_digit % 2 != 0:
                count += 1
    return count
```

This code will correctly implement the `specialFilter` function as per the requirements. The function iterates over the list of numbers, checks the conditions, and counts the numbers that satisfy all the criteria.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The code has a logical error when handling negative numbers. When converting a negative number to a string, the first character is a negative sign, which leads to incorrect digit extraction. To fix this, the code should handle negative numbers by considering the absolute value when extracting digits.

Here's the revised code:

```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    """Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns 
    the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both 
    first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
    For example:
    specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]) => 1 
    specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]) => 2
    """
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            num_str = str(abs(num))  # Use absolute value to handle negative numbers
            first_digit = int(num_str[0])
            last_digit = int(num_str[-1])
            if first_digit % 2 != 0 and last_digit % 2 != 0:
                count += 1
    return count

This change ensures that the function correctly handles negative numbers by using their absolute values when checking the first and last digits.

Comments on Codes:
"The code has a logical error when handling negative numbers. When converting a negative number to a string, the first character is a negative sign, which leads to incorrect digit extraction. To fix this, the code should handle negative numbers by considering the absolute value when extracting digits.

Here's the revised code:

```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    """Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns 
    the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both 
    first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
    For example:
    specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]) => 1 
    specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]) => 2
    """
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            num_str = str(abs(num))  # Use absolute value to handle negative numbers
            first_digit = int(num_str[0])
            last_digit = int(num_str[-1])
            if first_digit % 2 != 0 and last_digit % 2 != 0:
                count += 1
    return count
```

This change ensures that the function correctly handles negative numbers by using their absolute values when checking the first and last digits."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the `specialFilter` function to run. The function only uses basic Python operations and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to provide a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

If you plan to expand the project in the future and include additional packages, you can list them in this file as needed.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the `specialFilter` function to run. The function only uses basic Python operations and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to provide a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
If you plan to expand the project in the future and include additional packages, you can list them in this file as needed. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

The Programmer's assessment is correct. The `specialFilter` function does not require any external libraries or packages, as it only uses basic Python operations. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would indeed be empty. However, for the sake of completeness and future expansion, you can include a `requirements.txt` file with a comment indicating that no external dependencies are currently required. Here is how it would look:

```

# SpecialFilter

A Python function to filter numbers based on specific criteria.

## Overview

The `specialFilter` function is designed to take an array of numbers as input and return the count of elements that satisfy the following conditions:
- The number is greater than 10.
- Both the first and last digits of the number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).

### Example Usage

```python
specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15])  # Returns: 1
specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109])  # Returns: 2
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it simple to set up and use. You only need Python installed on your machine.

### Quick Install

Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If the code is hosted in a repository, clone it to your local machine. Otherwise, copy the `main.py` file to your working directory.

2. **Run the Function**: You can use the function by importing it into your Python script or running it directly in a Python environment.

### Example

```python
from main import specialFilter

# Define your list of numbers
numbers = [15, -73, 14, -15, 33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]

# Call the specialFilter function
result = specialFilter(numbers)

# Print the result
print(f"The count of numbers meeting the criteria is: {result}")
```

## Documentation

The `specialFilter` function is straightforward and does not require additional configuration or setup. It processes a list of integers and returns an integer representing the count of numbers meeting the specified criteria.

### Function Definition

```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    """
    Takes an array of numbers as input and returns the number of elements 
    that are greater than 10 and both first and last digits of a number are odd.
    """
```

- **Parameters**: 
  - `nums`: List of integers.
