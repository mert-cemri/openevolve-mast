We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To complete the task as specified by the customer, we need to implement the `is_sorted` function in Python. The task explicitly states not to implement a GUI interface or anything redundant, so we will focus solely on the function implementation. 

Here is the plan:

1. **Function Name**: `is_sorted`
2. **Purpose**: To determine if a list of integers is sorted in ascending order and does not contain more than one duplicate of the same number.
3. **Logic**:
   - Iterate through the list and check if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
   - Use a dictionary to count occurrences of each number and ensure no number appears more than twice.

Now, let's write the code for this function in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python

'''

Given a list of numbers, return whether or not they are sorted
in ascending order. If list has more than 1 duplicate of the same

is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]) ➞ False

'''

def is_sorted(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return True
    
    # Check if the list is sorted and count occurrences
    count = {}
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        if lst[i] in count:
            count[lst[i]] += 1
        else:
            count[lst[i]] = 1
        
        # Check if any number appears more than twice
        if count[lst[i]] > 1:

    # Check the last element for duplicates
    if lst[-1] in count and count[lst[-1]] >= 1:
        return False

The highest priority issue in the code is the incorrect handling of duplicate numbers. The current implementation incorrectly returns `False` if any number appears more than once, which contradicts the requirement that it should only return `False` if a number appears more than twice.

**Suggestion for Revision:**

Modify the condition that checks for duplicates to ensure that it only returns `False` if a number appears more than twice.

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return True
    # Check if the list is sorted and count occurrences
    count = {}
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        if lst[i] in count:
            count[lst[i]] += 1
        else:
            count[lst[i]] = 1
        # Check if any number appears more than twice
        if count[lst[i]] > 2:
            return False
    # Check the last element for duplicates
    if lst[-1] in count and count[lst[-1]] >= 2:
        return False
    return True
```

This change ensures that the function correctly returns `False` only when a number appears more than twice, aligning with the task requirements.

Comments on Codes:
"The highest priority issue in the code is the incorrect handling of duplicate numbers. The current implementation incorrectly returns `False` if any number appears more than once, which contradicts the requirement that it should only return `False` if a number appears more than twice.

**Suggestion for Revision:**

Modify the condition that checks for duplicates to ensure that it only returns `False` if a number appears more than twice.

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return True
    # Check if the list is sorted and count occurrences
    count = {}
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        if lst[i] in count:
            count[lst[i]] += 1
        else:
            count[lst[i]] = 1
        # Check if any number appears more than twice
        if count[lst[i]] > 2:
            return False
    # Check the last element for duplicates
    if lst[-1] in count and count[lst[-1]] >= 2:
        return False
    return True
```

This change ensures that the function correctly returns `False` only when a number appears more than twice, aligning with the task requirements."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The code has a logical error in the way it checks for duplicates. The current implementation incorrectly considers any number appearing more than once as a duplicate, but the requirement is to return False only if a number appears more than twice. The logic needs to be adjusted to allow numbers to appear twice but not more than that.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
Modify the condition that checks for duplicates to allow numbers to appear twice. Update the logic to return False only if a number appears more than twice.

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return True
    # Check if the list is sorted and count occurrences
    count = {}
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        if lst[i] in count:
            count[lst[i]] += 1
        else:
            count[lst[i]] = 1
        # Check if any number appears more than twice
        if count[lst[i]] > 2:
            return False
    # Check the last element for duplicates
    if lst[-1] in count and count[lst[-1]] >= 2:
        return False
    return True

This change ensures that the function correctly identifies lists that are sorted in ascending order and contain no number more than twice.

Comments on Codes:
"The code has a logical error in the way it checks for duplicates. The current implementation incorrectly considers any number appearing more than once as a duplicate, but the requirement is to return False only if a number appears more than twice. The logic needs to be adjusted to allow numbers to appear twice but not more than that.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
Modify the condition that checks for duplicates to allow numbers to appear twice. Update the logic to return False only if a number appears more than twice.

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return True
    # Check if the list is sorted and count occurrences
    count = {}
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        if lst[i] in count:
            count[lst[i]] += 1
        else:
            count[lst[i]] = 1
        # Check if any number appears more than twice
        if count[lst[i]] > 2:
            return False
    # Check the last element for duplicates
    if lst[-1] in count and count[lst[-1]] >= 2:
        return False
    return True
```

This change ensures that the function correctly identifies lists that are sorted in ascending order and contain no number more than twice."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The code has a logical error in the way it checks for duplicates. The current implementation incorrectly returns `False` if any number appears more than once, rather than more than twice. The logic should be adjusted to allow numbers to appear twice but not more than twice.

To fix this, modify the condition that checks for duplicates to allow a number to appear twice:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return True
    # Check if the list is sorted and count occurrences
    count = {}
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        if lst[i] in count:
            count[lst[i]] += 1
        else:
            count[lst[i]] = 1
        # Check if any number appears more than twice
        if count[lst[i]] > 2:
            return False
    # Check the last element for duplicates
    if lst[-1] in count and count[lst[-1]] >= 2:
        return False

This change ensures that the function correctly allows numbers to appear twice but not more than twice, aligning with the task requirements.

Comments on Codes:
"The code has a logical error in the way it checks for duplicates. The current implementation incorrectly returns `False` if any number appears more than once, rather than more than twice. The logic should be adjusted to allow numbers to appear twice but not more than twice.

To fix this, modify the condition that checks for duplicates to allow a number to appear twice:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return True
    # Check if the list is sorted and count occurrences
    count = {}
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        if lst[i] in count:
            count[lst[i]] += 1
        else:
            count[lst[i]] = 1
        # Check if any number appears more than twice
        if count[lst[i]] > 2:
            return False
    # Check the last element for duplicates
    if lst[-1] in count and count[lst[-1]] >= 2:
        return False
    return True
```

This change ensures that the function correctly allows numbers to appear twice but not more than twice, aligning with the task requirements."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The function `is_sorted` only utilizes basic Python data structures and control flow, which are part of the Python standard library. Therefore, there are no additional dependencies required for this project.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any external packages beyond the standard Python library.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The function `is_sorted` only utilizes basic Python data structures and control flow, which are part of the Python standard library. Therefore, there are no additional dependencies required for this project.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```
This indicates that the project does not rely on any external packages beyond the standard Python library. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            
def is_sorted(lst):
    '''
    Given a list of numbers, return whether or not they are sorted
    in ascending order. If list has more than 1 duplicate of the same
    number, return False. Assume no negative numbers and only integers.

    Examples
