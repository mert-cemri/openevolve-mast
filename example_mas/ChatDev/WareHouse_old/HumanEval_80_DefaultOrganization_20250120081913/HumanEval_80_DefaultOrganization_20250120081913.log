To complete the task, we need to implement the function `is_happy` in Python, which checks if a given string is "happy" based on the criteria provided. The task explicitly states not to implement a GUI interface, so we will focus solely on the logic required for the function.

### Core Function

- **Function Name**: `is_happy`
  - **Purpose**: To determine if a string is "happy". A string is considered happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains the implementation of the function `is_happy` which checks if a given string is "happy".
A string is happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct.

def is_happy(s):
    """You are given a string s.

    For example:

    is_happy(aa) => False
    is_happy(abcd) => True
    is_happy(aabb) => False
    is_happy(adb) => True
    is_happy(xyy) => False
    """
    # Check if the string length is less than 3
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False

    # Iterate through the string and check every 3 consecutive characters
    for i in range(len(s) - 2):
        # If any 3 consecutive characters are not distinct, return False
        if s[i] == s[i+1] or s[i+1] == s[i+2] or s[i] == s[i+2]:
            return False

    # If all 3 consecutive characters are distinct, return True
    return True
```

This code implements the `is_happy` function, which checks if a string meets the criteria of being "happy". It iterates through the string, checking each set of three consecutive characters to ensure they are distinct. If any set of three consecutive characters are not distinct, the function returns `False`. If all sets of three consecutive characters are distinct, it returns `True`.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `is_happy` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any external libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. Here is how it would look:

```

```

If you need to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it can simply be an empty file or contain a comment indicating no dependencies are needed.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `is_happy` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any external libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. Here is how it would look:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```
If you need to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it can simply be an empty file or contain a comment indicating no dependencies are needed. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I concur with the Programmer's assessment. The provided code in `main.py` for the `is_happy` function does not require any external libraries or dependencies, as it solely relies on basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would indeed be empty or contain a comment indicating that no external dependencies are needed. Here is how the `requirements.txt` file should look:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project

# Happy String Checker

This software provides a simple utility function to determine if a given string is "happy". A string is considered happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `is_happy(s)`. This function checks whether a given string `s` meets the criteria of being a "happy" string.

### Function: `is_happy(s)`

- **Input**: A string `s`.
- **Output**: A boolean value (`True` or `False`).
  - Returns `True` if the string is happy.
  - Returns `False` if the string is not happy.

#### Examples:

- `is_happy("a")` => `False`
- `is_happy("aa")` => `False`
- `is_happy("abcd")` => `True`
- `is_happy("aabb")` => `False`
- `is_happy("adb")` => `True`
- `is_happy("xyy")` => `False`

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to set up and use. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Steps to Install

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If the code is hosted in a repository, clone it to your local machine. Otherwise, download the `main.py` file.

3. **No Additional Dependencies**: There are no additional packages to install, as specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

To use the `is_happy` function, follow these steps:

1. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**: Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

2. **Run Python Interpreter**: You can test the function directly in the Python interpreter or by creating a script.

### Example Usage in Python Interpreter

```bash
python
```

```python
from main import is_happy

# Test the function with different strings

 # Happy String Checker

This software provides a simple utility function to determine if a given string is "happy". A string is considered happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `is_happy(s)`. This function checks whether a given string `s` meets the criteria of being a "happy" string.

### Function: `is_happy(s)`

- **Input**: A string `s`.
- **Output**: A boolean value (`True` or `False`).
  - Returns `True` if the string is happy.
  - Returns `False` if the string is not happy.

#### Examples:

- `is_happy("a")` => `False`
- `is_happy("aa")` => `False`
- `is_happy("abcd")` => `True`
- `is_happy("aabb")` => `False`
- `is_happy("adb")` => `True`
- `is_happy("xyy")` => `False`

```

```python
from main import is_happy

# Test the function with different strings
print(is_happy("abcd"))  # Output: True
print(is_happy("aabb"))  # Output: False
```

### Example Usage in a Python Script

Create a new Python file, for example `test_happy.py`, and add the following code:

```python
from main import is_happy

# Test the function
print(is_happy("abcd"))  # Output: True
print(is_happy("aabb"))  # Output: False
```

Run the script using:

```bash
python test_happy.py
```
