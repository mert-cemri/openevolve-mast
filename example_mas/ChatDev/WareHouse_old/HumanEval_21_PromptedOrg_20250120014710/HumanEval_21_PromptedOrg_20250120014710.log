To complete the task, we need to implement the `rescale_to_unit` function in Python. This function will take a list of floating-point numbers and apply a linear transformation so that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. Here's how we can achieve this:

1. **Function Name**: `rescale_to_unit`
   - **Purpose**: Transform a list of numbers such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1.

Now, let's write the code for this function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python

'''

Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1.

'''

from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
    [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
    """
    min_num = min(numbers)
    max_num = max(numbers)
    range_num = max_num - min_num
    return [(num - min_num) / range_num for num in numbers]

```

This code defines the `rescale_to_unit` function, which calculates the minimum and maximum values in the list, computes the range, and then applies the linear transformation to each number in the list. The result is a new list where the smallest number is 0 and the largest is 1, with all other numbers scaled proportionally between them.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Based on the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages used. The code only utilizes Python's built-in functions and the `typing` module, which is part of the Python standard library. Therefore, a `requirements.txt` file is not necessary for this project. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would be empty as there are no additional packages required.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

If you plan to expand the project in the future and use additional libraries, you can update the `requirements.txt` file accordingly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

Programmer: Based on the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages used. The code only utilizes Python's built-in functions and the `typing` module, which is part of the Python standard library. Therefore, a `requirements.txt` file is not necessary for this project. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would be empty as there are no additional packages required.
Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:
```

The Programmer is correct in their assessment. The provided code in `main.py` does not utilize any external libraries or packages beyond Python's standard library. Therefore, a `requirements.txt` file is not necessary for this project. However, for completeness and future expansion, you can create an empty `requirements.txt` file as follows:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

If in the future you decide to use additional libraries, you can update this file to include those dependencies.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Rescale to Unit

This software provides a simple utility function to rescale a list of numbers to a unit scale, where the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. This is useful for normalizing data for various applications, such as machine learning preprocessing.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `rescale_to_unit`, which takes a list of floating-point numbers and returns a new list where the numbers are linearly transformed to fit within the range [0, 1].

### Function Definition

```python
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
    [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
    """
```

### How It Works

- **Input**: A list of floating-point numbers with at least two elements.
- **Output**: A list of numbers rescaled to the range [0, 1].

The function calculates the minimum and maximum values in the list, computes the range, and then applies a linear transformation to each number in the list.

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. You can use it directly by including the `main.py` file in your project.

### Quick Install

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the `main.py` file to your project directory.

## Usage

To use the `rescale_to_unit` function, simply import it into your Python script and call it with a list of numbers.

### Example

```python
from main import rescale_to_unit

numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
rescaled_numbers = rescale_to_unit(numbers)
print(rescaled_numbers)  # Output: [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```

This example demonstrates how to import and use the function to rescale a list of numbers.

## Documentation

For further information and examples, please refer to the inline documentation within the `main.py` file. The function is designed to be straightforward and easy to integrate into your existing projects.
