To solve the task, we need to implement the `circular_shift` function in Python. The function should perform a circular shift of the digits of an integer `x` to the right by a specified number of positions `shift`. If the `shift` is greater than the number of digits in `x`, the function should return the digits reversed.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Convert the integer to a string**: This allows us to easily manipulate the digits.
2. **Determine the number of digits**: This helps us decide whether to perform a circular shift or reverse the digits.
3. **Perform the circular shift**: If the shift is less than or equal to the number of digits, perform the circular shift.
4. **Reverse the digits**: If the shift is greater than the number of digits, reverse the digits.
5. **Return the result as a string**: The function should return the result as a string.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to perform a circular shift on the digits of an integer.

def circular_shift(x, shift):
    """Circular shift the digits of the integer x, shift the digits right by shift
    and return the result as a string.
    If shift > number of digits, return digits reversed.
    
    >>> circular_shift(12, 1)
    "21"
    >>> circular_shift(12, 2)
    "12"
    """
    # Convert the integer to a string to manipulate digits
    x_str = str(x)
    num_digits = len(x_str)
    
    # If shift is greater than the number of digits, return the reversed string
    if shift > num_digits:
        return x_str[::-1]
    
    # Calculate the effective shift
    shift = shift % num_digits
    
    # Perform the circular shift
    shifted_str = x_str[-shift:] + x_str[:-shift]
    
    return shifted_str
```

This code defines the `circular_shift` function, which performs the required operations to achieve the desired functionality. The function first checks if the shift is greater than the number of digits and reverses the digits if true. Otherwise, it performs a circular shift by slicing the string appropriately. The result is returned as a string.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `circular_shift` only uses basic Python operations and standard library functions, which do not require any additional packages. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project

# Circular Shift Application

This application provides a function to perform a circular shift on the digits of an integer. The function shifts the digits of the integer to the right by a specified number of positions and returns the result as a string. If the shift value is greater than the number of digits in the integer, the function returns the digits in reverse order.

## Main Function

### `circular_shift(x, shift)`

- **Description**: Circularly shifts the digits of the integer `x` to the right by `shift` positions. If `shift` is greater than the number of digits, the digits are reversed.
- **Parameters**:
  - `x` (int): The integer whose digits are to be shifted.
  - `shift` (int): The number of positions to shift the digits.
- **Returns**: A string representing the shifted digits.
- **Examples**:
  - `circular_shift(12, 1)` returns `"21"`
  - `circular_shift(12, 2)` returns `"12"`
