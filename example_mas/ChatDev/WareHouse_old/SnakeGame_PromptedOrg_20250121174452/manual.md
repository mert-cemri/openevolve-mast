# Snake Game User Manual

Welcome to the Snake Game! This classic game allows you to control a snake using directional inputs to move around the board and eat 'food' items. Each time the snake eats, it grows in length. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundary. The board updates after each move.

- **Snake Movement**: Control the snake using the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to navigate the board.
- **Food Consumption**: The snake grows in length each time it eats the food.
