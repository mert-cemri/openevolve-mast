To solve the task, we need to implement the function `find_closest_elements` that identifies the two closest numbers in a list and returns them in ascending order. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Sort the List**: Sorting the list will help us easily find the closest elements since they will be adjacent in a sorted list.
2. **Initialize Variables**: We will keep track of the minimum difference found and the pair of numbers that have this minimum difference.
3. **Iterate Through the List**: We will iterate through the sorted list and calculate the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers.
4. **Update Minimum Difference**: If a smaller difference is found, update the minimum difference and the corresponding pair of numbers.
5. **Return the Pair**: Finally, return the pair of numbers with the smallest difference.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

main.py

```python

'''

From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

'''

from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    
    # Initialize the minimum difference as infinity and the closest pair
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (sorted_numbers[0], sorted_numbers[1])
    
    # Iterate through the sorted list to find the closest pair
    for i in range(len(sorted_numbers) - 1):
        # Calculate the difference between consecutive numbers
        diff = sorted_numbers[i + 1] - sorted_numbers[i]
        
        # Update the closest pair if a smaller difference is found
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (sorted_numbers[i], sorted_numbers[i + 1])
    
    return closest_pair

```

This code will correctly find and return the two closest numbers in a list, ensuring they are returned in ascending order.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required, as it only uses standard Python libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you want to include a placeholder or a comment, you can do so as follows:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```
This indicates that the project does not rely on any third-party packages. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Find Closest Elements

This software provides a function to find the two closest numbers in a list of floating-point numbers. It is designed to be simple and efficient, requiring no external dependencies.

## Main Functionality

The main function of this software is:

- `find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]`: This function takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the two numbers that are closest to each other in value. The returned numbers are ordered such that the smaller number comes first.

### Example Usage

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    # Sort the list of numbers
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    # Initialize the minimum difference as infinity and the closest pair
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (sorted_numbers[0], sorted_numbers[1])
    # Iterate through the sorted list to find the closest pair
    for i in range(len(sorted_numbers) - 1):
        # Calculate the difference between consecutive numbers
        diff = sorted_numbers[i + 1] - sorted_numbers[i]
        # Update the closest pair if a smaller difference is found
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (sorted_numbers[i], sorted_numbers[i + 1])
    return closest_pair

# Example
result = find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
print(result)  # Output: (2.0, 2.2)
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, so there is no need to install additional packages. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Environment:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Run the Code:**
   - Copy the function `find_closest_elements` into your Python script or interactive environment.
   - Call the function with a list of floating-point numbers to find the two closest numbers.

3. **Example:**
   - Use the provided example in the "Example Usage" section to test the function.

## Documentation

This software is straightforward and does not require extensive documentation. The function is self-contained and can be easily integrated into larger projects where finding the closest pair of numbers is necessary.

        # Calculate the difference between consecutive numbers
        diff = sorted_numbers[i + 1] - sorted_numbers[i]
        # Update the closest pair if a smaller difference is found
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff

# Example
result = find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
print(result)  # Output: (2.0, 2.2)
```
