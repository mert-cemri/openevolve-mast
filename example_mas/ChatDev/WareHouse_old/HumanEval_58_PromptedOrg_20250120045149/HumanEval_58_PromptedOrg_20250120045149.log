To complete the task, we need to implement the `common` function that returns sorted unique common elements from two lists. The function is straightforward and does not require multiple files or classes. We will implement this function in a single file, `main.py`.

Here is the breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Function Name**: `common`
   - **Purpose**: To find and return a sorted list of unique common elements from two input lists.

2. **Steps to Implement**:
   - Convert both lists to sets to remove duplicates and allow for set operations.
   - Find the intersection of these two sets to get common elements.
   - Convert the result back to a list and sort it.
   - Return the sorted list.

Now, let's implement the code in `main.py`.

FILENAME

```python

'''

Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.

'''

def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.
    >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
    [1, 5, 653]
    >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
    [2, 3]

    """
    # Convert lists to sets to remove duplicates and allow set operations
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)
    
    # Find intersection of both sets
    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)
    
    # Convert to list and sort
    result = sorted(common_elements)
    
    return result

```

This code will correctly implement the functionality as described in the task. The `common` function will return a sorted list of unique common elements from the two input lists.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

```

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required since it only uses Python's built-in data structures and functions. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed for the project to run properly.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

The Programmer's response is correct. Since the code provided in `main.py` only utilizes Python's built-in data structures and functions, there are no external dependencies required for the project. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty. This indicates that no additional packages are needed for the project to run properly.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
```

This empty file signifies that the project does not rely on any third-party libraries. If there are no further questions or tasks, I will consider this matter resolved.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

# Common Elements Finder

This software provides a simple utility function to find the sorted unique common elements between two lists. It is designed to be straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's set operations to achieve the desired functionality.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `common(l1, l2)`, which takes two lists as input and returns a sorted list of unique elements that are common to both input lists.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import common

# Example 1
result1 = common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
print(result1)  # Output: [1, 5, 653]

# Example 2
result2 = common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
print(result2)  # Output: [2, 3]
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Change your current directory to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Although there are no external dependencies required for this software, it is recommended to create a virtual environment for your project:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

   If there were dependencies, you would install them using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   However, the `requirements.txt` file is empty as no additional packages are needed.

## How to Use

1. **Import the Function**

   Import the `common` function from the `main.py` file into your Python script.

   ```python
   from main import common
   ```

2. **Call the Function**

   Pass two lists as arguments to the `common` function to get the sorted unique common elements.

   ```python
   result = common(list1, list2)
   ```

3. **Output the Result**

   Print or otherwise use the result as needed.

   ```python
   print(result)
   ```

## Additional Information

This software is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making use of Python's built-in set operations to quickly find common elements between two lists. It is suitable for small to medium-sized lists and can be easily integrated into larger projects as a utility function.

For any issues or contributions, please refer to the project's repository and follow the contribution guidelines.
