    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.

    The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],
    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].

    Example 1:

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

    "Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes
    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.
    If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index.

    The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],
    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].

    Example 1:
        Input: [4,2,3]

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# Pluck Function User Manual

Welcome to the user manual for the `pluck` function. This document will guide you through the main functionalities of the software, how to set up the environment, and how to use the function effectively.

## Overview

The `pluck` function is designed to process an array of non-negative integer nodes, representing a branch of a tree. Its primary purpose is to identify and return the smallest even value node along with its index. If there are multiple nodes with the same smallest even value, the function returns the node with the smallest index. If no even values are present or the array is empty, the function returns an empty list.

### Key Features

- **Identify Smallest Even Node**: Finds the smallest even value in the array.
- **Index Retrieval**: Returns the index of the smallest even node.
- **Handles Empty Arrays**: Returns an empty list if no even numbers are found or if the array is empty.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

To run the `pluck` function, you need to have Python installed on your system. The function does not require any additional libraries or dependencies, making it lightweight and easy to integrate into existing projects.

### Quick Install

1. **Python Installation**: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If the function is part of a larger project, clone the repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

## Usage

To use the `pluck` function, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Function**: If the function is part of a module, import it into your Python script.
   ```python
   from main import pluck
   ```

2. **Call the Function**: Pass an array of non-negative integers to the function.
   ```python
   result = pluck([4, 2, 3])
   print(result)  # Output: [2, 1]
   ```

### Example Usage

Here are some examples to demonstrate how the `pluck` function works:

- **Example 1**:
  ```python
  result = pluck([4, 2, 3])
  print(result)  # Output: [2, 1]
  ```

- **Example 2**:
  ```python
  result = pluck([1, 2, 3])
  print(result)  # Output: [2, 1]
  ```

- **Example 3**:
  ```python
  result = pluck([])
  print(result)  # Output: []
  ```

- **Example 4**:
  ```python
  result = pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2])
  print(result)  # Output: [0, 1]
  ```

## Conclusion

The `pluck` function is a simple yet effective tool for identifying the smallest even node in an array. With no additional dependencies required, it is easy to integrate and use in various applications. For any further assistance or support, please reach out to the development team.

The `pluck` function is designed to process an array of non-negative integer nodes, representing a branch of a tree. Its primary purpose is to identify and return the smallest even value node along with its index. If there are multiple nodes with the same smallest even value, the function returns the node with the smallest index. If no even values are present or the array is empty, the function returns an empty list.

### Key Features

- **Identify Smallest Even Node**: Finds the smallest even value in the array.
- **Index Retrieval**: Returns the index of the smallest even node.
- **Handles Empty Arrays**: Returns an empty list if no even numbers are found or if the array is empty.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

To run the `pluck` function, you need to have Python installed on your system. The function does not require any additional libraries or dependencies, making it lightweight and easy to integrate into existing projects.

### Quick Install

1. **Python Installation**: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If the function is part of a larger project, clone the repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

## Usage

To use the `pluck` function, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Function**: If the function is part of a module, import it into your Python script.
   ```python
   from main import pluck
   ```

2. **Call the Function**: Pass an array of non-negative integers to the function.
   ```python
   result = pluck([4, 2, 3])
   print(result)  # Output: [2, 1]
   ```

### Example Usage

Here are some examples to demonstrate how the `pluck` function works:

- **Example 1**:
  ```python
  result = pluck([4, 2, 3])
  print(result)  # Output: [2, 1]
  ```

- **Example 2**:
  ```python
  result = pluck([1, 2, 3])
  print(result)  # Output: [2, 1]
  ```

- **Example 3**:
  ```python
  result = pluck([])
  print(result)  # Output: []
  ```

- **Example 4**:
  ```python
  result = pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2])
  print(result)  # Output: [0, 1]
  ```
