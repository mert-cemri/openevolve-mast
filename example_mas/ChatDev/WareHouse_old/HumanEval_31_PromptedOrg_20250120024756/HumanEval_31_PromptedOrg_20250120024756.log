To solve the task, we need to implement the `is_prime` function in Python. This function will determine if a given number is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Here's a step-by-step outline of what we need to do:

1. **Function Name**: `is_prime`
   - **Purpose**: To check if a given number is prime.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - If the number is less than or equal to 1, return `False`.
   - If the number is 2, return `True` (2 is the only even prime number).
   - If the number is even and greater than 2, return `False`.
   - For numbers greater than 2, check divisibility from 3 up to the square root of the number. If any divisor is found, return `False`. Otherwise, return `True`.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to determine if a number is prime.

def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.
    >>> is_prime(6)
    False
    >>> is_prime(101)
    True
    >>> is_prime(11)
    True
    >>> is_prime(13441)
    True
    >>> is_prime(61)
    True
    >>> is_prime(4)
    False
    >>> is_prime(1)
    False
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This code will correctly determine if a number is prime based on the logic outlined above. It efficiently checks for primality by reducing the number of potential divisors to check, leveraging the properties of prime numbers.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The `is_prime` function only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not necessary. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that there are no additional packages needed for the project to run properly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

## Quick Install

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Prime Number Checker

This software module provides a function to determine if a given number is prime. It is a simple utility that can be used in various applications where prime number checking is required.

## Main Function

The main function provided by this module is `is_prime(n)`. This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise.

### Function Signature

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise."""
```

### Example Usage

```python
>>> is_prime(6)
False
>>> is_prime(101)
True
>>> is_prime(11)
True
>>> is_prime(13441)
True
>>> is_prime(61)
True
>>> is_prime(4)
False
>>> is_prime(1)
False
```

## Installation

This module does not require any external dependencies, making it easy to integrate into your existing Python projects.

### Quick Install

Simply download the `main.py` file and include it in your project directory. You can then import the `is_prime` function into your scripts as needed.

```bash
# No external dependencies required
```

## How to Use

1. **Download the `main.py` file**: Ensure that the file is in your project directory.

2. **Import the function**: In your Python script, import the `is_prime` function.

    ```python
    from main import is_prime
    ```

3. **Call the function**: Use the `is_prime` function by passing an integer as an argument to check if it is a prime number.

    ```python
    result = is_prime(29)
    print(result)  # Output: True
    ```

## Documentation

The function is designed to be efficient and straightforward. It checks for primality by:

- Returning `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1.
- Returning `True` for the number 2, which is the only even prime number.
- Returning `False` for any other even number.
- Iterating through odd numbers up to the square root of `n` to check for divisibility.

This approach ensures that the function runs efficiently even for larger numbers.
