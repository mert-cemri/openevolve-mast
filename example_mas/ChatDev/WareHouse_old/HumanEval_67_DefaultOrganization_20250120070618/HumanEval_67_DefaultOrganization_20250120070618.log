As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To complete the task, we need to implement the function `fruit_distribution` in Python. The function will calculate the number of mangoes in a basket given a string that specifies the number of apples and oranges, and an integer that represents the total number of fruits in the basket. We will not implement a GUI as per the customer's task requirements.

Let's outline the necessary function:

1. **Function: `fruit_distribution(s, n)`**
   - **Purpose**: Calculate the number of mangoes in the basket.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `s`: A string containing the number of apples and oranges.
     - `n`: An integer representing the total number of fruits in the basket.
   - **Returns**: The number of mangoes in the basket.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

    # Extract numbers from the string
    parts = s.split()
    apples = int(parts[0])
    oranges = int(parts[3])
    
    # Calculate the number of mangoes
    mangoes = n - apples - oranges
    return mangoes

# Example usage
print(fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19))  # Output: 8
print(fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3))   # Output: 2
print(fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100)) # Output: 95
print(fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120)) # Output: 19
```

This code defines the `fruit_distribution` function, which extracts the number of apples and oranges from the input string, calculates the number of mangoes, and returns it. The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how the function works with the provided test cases.

print(fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19))  # Output: 8
print(fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3))   # Output: 2
print(fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100)) # Output: 95
print(fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120)) # Output: 19
```

This code defines the `fruit_distribution` function, which extracts the number of apples and oranges from the input string, calculates the number of mangoes, and returns it. The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how the function works with the provided test cases.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required for it to run properly. The function `fruit_distribution` only uses basic Python functionality, which does not require any additional libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to provide a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any external Python packages.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required for it to run properly. The function `fruit_distribution` only uses basic Python functionality, which does not require any additional libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to provide a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required

This indicates that the project does not rely on any external Python packages. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I confirm that the Programmer's assessment is correct. The `fruit_distribution` function in `main.py` does not require any external libraries or dependencies beyond the standard Python library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would indeed be empty or not needed. However, for the sake of completeness and to adhere to standard practices, you can create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This file serves as a placeholder to indicate that the project does not rely on any additional Python packages. If in the future, the project expands to include features that require external libraries, this file can be updated accordingly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation
