To solve the task, we need to implement a function `right_angle_triangle` that determines if three given sides can form a right-angled triangle. The function will use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the implementation:

1. **Function Name**: `right_angle_triangle`
   - **Purpose**: To check if three given sides form a right-angled triangle.

2. **Logic**:
   - Identify the longest side, which would be the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle.
   - Use the Pythagorean theorem to check if the square of the longest side equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
   - Return `True` if the condition is met, otherwise return `False`.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python
'''
Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
90 degree.
Example:
right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
'''

def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    # Sort the sides to identify the hypotenuse
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    # Check the Pythagorean theorem
    return sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2
```

This code will correctly determine if the given sides form a right-angled triangle by checking the Pythagorean theorem condition.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the given code, there are no external dependencies or packages required to run the function `right_angle_triangle`. The function only uses basic Python operations and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file can be left empty or omitted entirely. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not require any additional Python packages beyond the standard library.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code, there are no external dependencies or packages required to run the function `right_angle_triangle`. The function only uses basic Python operations and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file can be left empty or omitted entirely. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that the project does not require any additional Python packages beyond the standard library. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

To complete the task, you will analyze the customer's requirements and provide recommendations based on your expertise.]

The Programmer's assessment is correct. The function `right_angle_triangle` does not require any external libraries or dependencies as it only uses basic Python operations. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file can be left empty or omitted. However, for completeness, you can include a `requirements.txt` file with a comment indicating that no external dependencies are required. Here is how it would look:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This ensures clarity and completeness in the project documentation. If there are no further tasks or questions, I will consider this matter resolved.

# Right Angle Triangle Checker

This software provides a simple function to determine if three given side lengths can form a right-angled triangle. It uses the Pythagorean theorem to verify if the triangle is right-angled.

## Main Function

The main function of this software is:

### `right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)`

- **Description**: This function takes three arguments, which are the lengths of the sides of a triangle. It returns `True` if the sides form a right-angled triangle and `False` otherwise.
- **Parameters**:
  - `a` (int or float): Length of the first side.
  - `b` (int or float): Length of the second side.
  - `c` (int or float): Length of the third side.
- **Returns**: `bool` - `True` if the sides form a right-angled triangle, `False` otherwise.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5)  # Returns: True
  right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)  # Returns: False
  ```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies. It is implemented in pure Python and can be run in any standard Python environment.

### Quick Install

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/).

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change your directory to the cloned repository:
   ```bash
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Run the Code**: You can use the function in your Python scripts or interactive sessions. Here is an example of how to use it:
   ```python
   from main import right_angle_triangle

   # Example usage
   print(right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5))  # Output: True
   print(right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3))  # Output: False
   ```

## Documentation

For further details on how the function works, you can refer to the docstring provided in the `main.py` file. The function is straightforward and uses basic Python operations to determine if the triangle is right-angled.

## Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please feel free to reach out through the project's issue tracker on the repository page. We welcome feedback and contributions to improve the software.
