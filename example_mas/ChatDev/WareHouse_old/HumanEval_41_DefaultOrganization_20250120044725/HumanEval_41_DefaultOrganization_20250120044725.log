To solve the given task, we need to implement the function `car_race_collision` in Python. The task is to calculate the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road. Since the cars are infinitely sturdy, they continue moving after a collision. The number of collisions will be equal to the number of cars in one set, as each car from one set will collide with exactly one car from the other set.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what needs to be done:

1. **Function Definition**: We need to define the function `car_race_collision` that takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of cars in each set.

2. **Logic Implementation**: Since each car from the left-to-right set will collide with exactly one car from the right-to-left set, the number of collisions will be equal to `n`.

3. **Return the Result**: The function should return the number of collisions, which is `n`.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

```

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `car_race_collision` is a simple mathematical function that does not utilize any libraries outside of Python's standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should be empty or not necessary. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required

This indicates that there are no additional packages needed for this project.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Car Race Collision Calculator

This software is designed to calculate the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road. The cars are infinitely sturdy and continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

## Main Functionality

The main function of this software is:

- **car_race_collision(n: int) -> int**: This function calculates and returns the number of collisions between two sets of cars. Each set contains `n` cars, with one set moving left to right and the other moving right to left. The function returns the number of collisions, which is equal to `n`.

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it simple and straightforward to use. You can run it directly in any Python environment.

### Quick Install

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file to your local machine.

3. No additional installation steps are required since there are no external dependencies.

## How to Use

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

3. Run the Python script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. You can call the `car_race_collision` function within the script or from an interactive Python shell by importing the function:

   ```python
   from main import car_race_collision

   # Example usage
   number_of_collisions = car_race_collision(5)
   print(f"Number of collisions: {number_of_collisions}")
   ```

   This will output the number of collisions based on the number of cars in each set.

## Documentation

The function is documented within the code, providing a clear explanation of its purpose and usage. You can refer to the docstring in the `main.py` file for more details.

For any further assistance or inquiries, please contact our support team.
