# Car Race Collision Calculator

This software is designed to calculate the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road. The cars are infinitely sturdy and continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

## Main Functionality

The main function of this software is:

- **car_race_collision(n: int) -> int**: This function calculates and returns the number of collisions between two sets of cars. Each set contains `n` cars, with one set moving left to right and the other moving right to left. The function returns the number of collisions, which is equal to `n`.

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it simple and straightforward to use. You can run it directly in any Python environment.

### Quick Install

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file to your local machine.

3. No additional installation steps are required since there are no external dependencies.

## How to Use

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

3. Run the Python script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. You can call the `car_race_collision` function within the script or from an interactive Python shell by importing the function:

   ```python
   from main import car_race_collision

   # Example usage
   number_of_collisions = car_race_collision(5)
   print(f"Number of collisions: {number_of_collisions}")
   ```

   This will output the number of collisions based on the number of cars in each set.

## Documentation

The function is documented within the code, providing a clear explanation of its purpose and usage. You can refer to the docstring in the `main.py` file for more details.
