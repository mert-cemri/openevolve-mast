.
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To solve the task, we need to implement the `count_distinct_characters` function. This function will take a string as input and return the number of distinct characters in the string, ignoring case. We will use Python's set data structure to achieve this, as sets inherently store only unique elements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the implementation:

1. **Function Name**: `count_distinct_characters`
   - **Purpose**: To count the number of distinct characters in a given string, ignoring case.

2. **Steps in the Function**:
   - Convert the input string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity.
   - Use a set to store characters, as sets automatically handle uniqueness.
   - Return the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct characters.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python

'''

Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) it consists of.

'''

def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """ Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of
    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
    3
    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
    4
    """
    # Convert the string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity
    lowercase_string = string.lower()
    
    # Use a set to store distinct characters
    distinct_characters = set(lowercase_string)
    
    # Return the number of distinct characters
    return len(distinct_characters)
```

This implementation should meet the requirements specified in the task. The function converts the input string to lowercase, uses a set to collect distinct characters, and returns the count of these characters.

    # Use a set to store distinct characters
    distinct_characters = set(lowercase_string)
    
    # Return the number of distinct characters
    return len(distinct_characters)

This implementation should meet the requirements specified in the task. The function converts the input string to lowercase, uses a set to collect distinct characters, and returns the count of these characters.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Count Distinct Characters

This software provides a simple function to count the number of distinct characters in a given string, regardless of case sensitivity. It is implemented in Python and is designed to be straightforward and efficient.

## Main Function

The core functionality is provided by the `count_distinct_characters` function, which takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in that string, ignoring case differences.

### Function Signature

```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
```

### Example Usage

```python
>>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
3
>>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
4
```

## Installation

To use this function, you need to have Python installed on your machine. The function does not require any external libraries, so no additional dependencies are needed.

### Steps to Install Python

1. **Download Python**: Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for your operating system.

3. **Verify Installation**: Open a terminal or command prompt and type `python --version` to verify that Python is installed correctly.

## How to Use

1. **Create a Python File**: Create a new file named `main.py` and copy the function code into this file.

2. **Run the Function**: You can test the function by calling it with different string inputs. For example, open a Python interpreter or run the `main.py` file with the following code:

   ```python
   from main import count_distinct_characters

   print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Output: 3
   print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))   # Output: 4
   ```

3. **Modify and Extend**: Feel free to modify the function or integrate it into larger projects as needed.

## Documentation

This function is designed to be simple and self-explanatory. For further assistance or to report issues, please contact our support team.
