Given the task at hand, which involves writing a function to solve a specific coding problem, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application" since it involves implementing software code. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `count_up_to(n)` that returns an array of prime numbers less than `n`. The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus solely on the logic to find prime numbers. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Function Definition**: Define the function `count_up_to(n)`.
2. **Prime Checking**: Implement a helper function to check if a number is prime.
3. **Iterate and Collect Primes**: Iterate through numbers less than `n` and collect those that are prime.
4. **Return the Result**: Return the list of prime numbers.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

main.py

```python
'''
This module contains a function to find all prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer n.
'''

def is_prime(num):
    """Check if a number is a prime number."""
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def count_up_to(n):
    """Implement a function that takes a non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n.
    """
    primes = []
    for num in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(num):
            primes.append(num)
    return primes
```

This code defines the `count_up_to` function, which uses a helper function `is_prime` to determine if a number is prime. It iterates through numbers less than `n` and collects those that are prime into a list, which is then returned. This solution meets the requirements specified by the customer.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

pandas>=1.1.4

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required, as it only uses built-in Python functions and libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, to maintain a standard format, you can include a comment indicating that no external packages are needed.
Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I understand the importance of ensuring that our project documentation is clear and complete. Given the information provided by the Programmer, it is clear that the current project does not require any external Python packages. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should reflect this. Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```

This comment serves as a clear indication to anyone reviewing the project that no additional packages need to be installed for the code to function as intended. If there are any changes in the future that introduce new dependencies, this file should be updated accordingly.

# Prime Number Finder

This software provides a simple utility to find all prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, requiring no external dependencies.

## Main Functions

The main function of this software is `count_up_to(n)`, which takes a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list of all prime numbers less than `n`.

### Function Details

- **`count_up_to(n)`**: 
  - **Input**: A non-negative integer `n`.
  - **Output**: A list of prime numbers less than `n`.
  - **Examples**:
    - `count_up_to(5)` returns `[2, 3]`
    - `count_up_to(11)` returns `[2, 3, 5, 7]`
    - `count_up_to(0)` returns `[]`
    - `count_up_to(20)` returns `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]`
    - `count_up_to(1)` returns `[]`
