As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To solve the task, we need to implement the function `select_words` which will take a string `s` and a natural number `n` as inputs and return a list of words from the string that contain exactly `n` consonants. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Split the String**: We will split the input string `s` into individual words.
2. **Identify Consonants**: We will define a set of consonants to check against each character in the words.
3. **Count Consonants**: For each word, we will count the number of consonants.
4. **Filter Words**: We will collect words that have exactly `n` consonants.
5. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the list of words that meet the criteria.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python

'''

Given a string s and a natural number n, implement a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly n consonants, in the order these words appear in the string s.
If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.

Examples:
select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []
select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]

'''

def select_words(s, n):
    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
    words = s.split()
    result = []
    
    for word in words:
        consonant_count = sum(1 for char in word if char.isalpha() and char not in vowels)
        if consonant_count == n:
            result.append(word)
    
    return result

```

This code defines the function `select_words` which processes the input string `s` to find and return words with exactly `n` consonants. It uses a set of vowels to determine consonants and iterates through each word to count consonants, appending those that match the criteria to the result list.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code only uses built-in Python functionalities. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed for the project to run properly.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Select Words Software

This software provides a function to extract words from a given string that contain a specified number of consonants. It is designed to be simple and efficient, with no external dependencies required.

## Main Functionality

The main function of this software is `select_words(s, n)`, which takes two parameters:
- `s`: A string containing words separated by spaces.
- `n`: A natural number representing the exact number of consonants a word must have to be included in the result.

The function returns a list of words from the string `s` that contain exactly `n` consonants, maintaining the order in which they appear in the string. If the string `s` is empty, the function returns an empty list.

### Examples

- `select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4)` returns `["little"]`
- `select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3)` returns `["Mary", "lamb"]`
- `select_words("simple white space", 2)` returns `[]`
- `select_words("Hello world", 4)` returns `["world"]`
- `select_words("Uncle sam", 3)` returns `["Uncle"]`

## Installation

 # Select Words Software

This software provides a function to extract words from a given string that contain a specified number of consonants. It is designed to be simple and efficient, with no external dependencies required.

## Main Functionality

The main function of this software is `select_words(s, n)`, which takes two parameters:
- `s`: A string containing words separated by spaces.
- `n`: A natural number representing the exact number of consonants a word must have to be included in the result.

The function returns a list of words from the string `s` that contain exactly `n` consonants, maintaining the order in which they appear in the string. If the string `s` is empty, the function returns an empty list.

### Examples

- `select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4)` returns `["little"]`
- `select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3)` returns `["Mary", "lamb"]`
- `select_words("simple white space", 2)` returns `[]`
- `select_words("Hello world", 4)` returns `["world"]`
- `select_words("Uncle sam", 3)` returns `["Uncle"]`
