Given the task, the product modality should focus on providing a functional solution to the coding problem. Since the task involves writing a function in Python, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application" as it involves implementing a software tool. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. The task requires writing and testing a Python function, which aligns well with the "Application" modality. This will allow us to focus on developing and delivering a functional piece of software code.

To complete the task, we need to implement the `anti_shuffle` function in Python. The function will take a string as input and return a new string where each word is sorted in ascending order based on ASCII value, while maintaining the original order of words and spaces. Since the task specifies not to implement a GUI, we will focus solely on the function implementation.

Let's outline the necessary function:

1. **Function: `anti_shuffle(s)`**
   - **Purpose:** Takes a string `s` and returns a new string where each word is sorted in ascending order based on ASCII value. The order of words and spaces in the original string should be preserved.
   - **Implementation Details:** 
     - Split the string into words while preserving spaces.
     - Sort each word individually.
     - Reconstruct the string with sorted words and original spaces.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python
'''
This module contains the implementation of the anti_shuffle function
which takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.

def anti_shuffle(s):
    """

    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:
    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'
    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'
    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
    """
    # Split the string into words and spaces
    words = s.split(' ')
    
    # Sort each word individually
    sorted_words = [''.join(sorted(word)) for word in words]
    
    # Join the sorted words with spaces to reconstruct the original sentence structure
    return ' '.join(sorted_words)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(anti_shuffle('Hi'))  # Output: 'Hi'
    print(anti_shuffle('hello'))  # Output: 'ehllo'
    print(anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!'))  # Output: 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
```

This code defines the `anti_shuffle` function, which processes the input string as described and returns the desired output. The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how the function works with different inputs.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
    ascending order based on ascii value.
    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:
    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'
    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'

For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `anti_shuffle` uses only built-in Python functions and libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, indicating that no additional packages need to be installed for the project to run properly.

# Anti-Shuffle Application

This application provides a function called `anti_shuffle` that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it. The ordered version of the string is achieved by sorting the characters of each word in ascending order based on their ASCII values, while maintaining the original order of words and spaces in the sentence.

## Main Functionality

### anti_shuffle Function

- **Purpose**: To reorder the characters of each word in a string in ascending ASCII order.
- **Input**: A string `s` where words are separated by spaces.
- **Output**: A string where each word's characters are sorted, maintaining the original order of words and spaces.

#### Example Usage

```python
from main import anti_shuffle

print(anti_shuffle('Hi'))  # Output: 'Hi'
print(anti_shuffle('hello'))  # Output: 'ehllo'
print(anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!'))  # Output: 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
```

## Installation

### Environment Setup

To run the `anti_shuffle` function, you need to have Python installed on your system. The function does not require any additional dependencies, so no external packages need to be installed.

1. **Install Python**: If you do not have Python installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the `main.py` file to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

3. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change your directory to where the `main.py` file is located.

```bash
cd <repository-directory>
```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**: You can run the script directly from the command line to see the example outputs.

```bash
python main.py
```

2. **Integrate into Your Project**: You can import the `anti_shuffle` function into your own Python projects.

```python
from main import anti_shuffle

# Use the function in your project
result = anti_shuffle('Your string here')
```

## Documentation

The `anti_shuffle` function is documented within the `main.py` file. You can refer to the docstring in the function for a detailed explanation of its purpose and usage.

For further assistance or inquiries, please contact our support team.

```

This manual provides a comprehensive guide to using the `anti_shuffle` function, including installation instructions, usage examples, and integration tips.
