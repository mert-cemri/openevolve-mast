Considering the task at hand, which involves writing a function to split a string into words, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task is related to software development and involves implementing a specific function in Python. An application would allow us to demonstrate the functionality effectively. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, we need to focus on the core functionality of splitting a string into words based on spaces or commas. The task explicitly states not to implement a GUI, so we will disregard the GUI requirement mentioned in the task description and focus solely on the function implementation.

Here's the plan:

1. **Function Name**: `words_string`
   - **Purpose**: To split a given string into words, where words are separated by spaces or commas, and return a list of words.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python
'''

This module contains a function to split a string into words based on spaces or commas.

'''

def words_string(s):
    """
    Splits a string into words separated by commas or spaces and returns a list of words.

    Args:
    s (str): A string of words separated by commas or spaces.

    Returns:
    list: A list of words.

    Examples:
    >>> words_string("Hi, my name is John")
    ['Hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John']
    >>> words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six")
    ['One', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six']
    """
    # Replace commas with spaces and then split by spaces
    return s.replace(',', ' ').split()
```

This code will correctly split the input string into words, handling both spaces and commas as delimiters. The function `words_string` replaces commas with spaces and then uses the `split()` method to separate the string into words, returning them as a list.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.

"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `words_string` only uses basic string operations that are part of Python's standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed for this project.
Here's how the `requirements.txt` file would look:
```
# No external dependencies required
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Words String Splitter

This software module provides a simple function to split a string of words separated by commas or spaces into an array of words. It is designed to be straightforward and efficient, requiring no external dependencies.

## Main Function

The main function provided by this module is `words_string(s)`. This function takes a single string argument and returns a list of words. The string can contain words separated by either commas or spaces.

### Function Definition

```python
def words_string(s):
    """
    Splits a string into words separated by commas or spaces and returns a list of words.
    
    Args:
