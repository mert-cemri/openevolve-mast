Given the task at hand, which involves writing a piece of software code to solve a specific problem, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a functional piece of code, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts on this?

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To solve the task, we need to write a Python function that extracts words from a given sentence whose lengths are prime numbers. We will not implement a GUI as the task explicitly states not to do so. The task requires only the necessary code to solve the problem.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Prime Number Check**: We need a helper function to determine if a number is prime.
2. **Extract Words**: Split the sentence into words.
3. **Filter Words**: Use the prime number check to filter words whose lengths are prime numbers.
4. **Return Result**: Join the filtered words into a single string and return it.

Now, let's write the code for the `main.py` file:

main.py

```python
'''

This module contains a function to extract words from a sentence
whose lengths are prime numbers.

'''

def is_prime(n):
    """
    Check if a number is a prime number.

    :param n: Integer to check for primality
    :return: True if n is a prime number, False otherwise
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    Extract words from a sentence whose lengths are prime numbers.

    :param sentence: A string representing a sentence
    :return: A string containing words with prime lengths
    """
    words = sentence.split()
    prime_length_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    return ' '.join(prime_length_words)
```

This code defines two functions:

- `is_prime(n)`: A helper function to check if a number `n` is a prime number.
- `words_in_sentence(sentence)`: The main function that processes the input sentence, filters words based on their length being a prime number, and returns the result as a string.

This solution adheres to the task requirements and constraints, ensuring that the code is concise and functional without any unnecessary components.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code uses only built-in Python functions and libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any external Python packages.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code uses only built-in Python functions and libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that the project does not rely on any external Python packages. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Programmer correctly pointed out, the provided code does not require any external dependencies or packages since it only utilizes built-in Python functions. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would indeed be empty or not necessary. However, for completeness and to adhere to standard practices, you can include a `requirements.txt` file with a comment indicating the absence of external dependencies:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This serves as a clear indication to anyone reviewing the project that no additional packages need to be installed for the code to function properly.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Prime Length Words Extractor

This software module is designed to extract words from a given sentence whose lengths are prime numbers. It is implemented in Python and does not require any external dependencies.

## Main Functions

### `is_prime(n)`

- **Purpose**: Checks if a given number `n` is a prime number.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `n` (int): The number to check for primality.
- **Returns**: 
  - `True` if `n` is a prime number.
  - `False` otherwise.

### `words_in_sentence(sentence)`

- **Purpose**: Extracts words from a sentence whose lengths are prime numbers.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `sentence` (str): A string representing a sentence.
- **Returns**: 
  - A string containing words from the original sentence that have prime lengths, maintaining their original order.

## Installation

This software does not require any external libraries or dependencies. It is implemented in pure Python. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**: 
   - You can clone the repository or download the `main.py` file to your local machine.

2. **Run the Code**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
