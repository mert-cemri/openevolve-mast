Considering the task at hand, which involves writing and fixing a piece of software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a functional piece of code, which aligns with the creation of a software tool or application. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. Since the task involves writing and fixing code, creating an "Application" is the most appropriate modality. This will allow us to focus on the functionality and ensure the code works as desired.

To complete the task, we need to implement the `rolling_max` function in Python. The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus solely on the logic of the function. The function should take a list of integers and return a list where each element is the maximum value found in the list up to that point.

Let's outline the necessary function:

1. **Function: `rolling_max`**
   - **Purpose**: To compute the rolling maximum of a list of integers.
   - **Input**: A list of integers.
   - **Output**: A list of integers representing the rolling maximum values.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains the implementation of the rolling_max function which computes the rolling maximum of a list of integers.

'''

from typing import List

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment
    in the sequence.
    >>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    """
    if not numbers:
        return []

    max_so_far = numbers[0]
    result = [max_so_far]

    for num in numbers[1:]:
        if num > max_so_far:
            max_so_far = num
        result.append(max_so_far)

    return result
```

This code defines the `rolling_max` function, which iterates over the input list, keeping track of the maximum value encountered so far and appending it to the result list. This ensures that each position in the result list contains the maximum value found up to that point in the input list.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.

"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required beyond the standard Python library. The `rolling_max` function only uses basic Python features and the `typing` module, which is part of the standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, as no additional packages are needed.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
```
This indicates that there are no external dependencies required for the project. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I agree with the Programmer's assessment. The `rolling_max` function utilizes only the standard Python library, specifically the `typing` module, which does not require any external packages. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, indicating that no additional dependencies are needed for this project.

This application provides a simple utility function to compute the rolling maximum of a list of integers. The rolling maximum is the highest value encountered in the list up to each point in the sequence.

## Main Function

### `rolling_max`

- **Description**: This function takes a list of integers and returns a new list where each element is the maximum value encountered in the list up to that point.
- **Usage**: 
  ```python
  from main import rolling_max
  
  result = rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
  print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
  ```
- **Parameters**: 
  - `numbers` (List[int]): A list of integers for which the rolling maximum is to be computed.
- **Returns**: 
  - List[int]: A list of integers representing the rolling maximum values.

## Installation
