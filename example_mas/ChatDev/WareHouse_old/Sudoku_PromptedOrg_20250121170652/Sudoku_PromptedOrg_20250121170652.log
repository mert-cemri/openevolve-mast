The program should allow the player to input values for specific cells, check for mistakes, and confirm when the puzzle is completed..
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To develop a classic Sudoku puzzle solver/creator, we will need to implement several core components. Here's a breakdown of the necessary classes and functions:

1. **SudokuBoard**: This class will represent the Sudoku board.
   - `__init__(self)`: Initialize a 9x9 grid.
   - `is_valid_move(self, row, col, num)`: Check if placing a number in a specific cell is valid.
   - `place_number(self, row, col, num)`: Place a number on the board.
   - `remove_number(self, row, col)`: Remove a number from the board.
   - `is_complete(self)`: Check if the board is completely and correctly filled.

2. **SudokuSolver**: This class will handle solving the Sudoku puzzle.
   - `solve(self, board)`: Solve the Sudoku puzzle using backtracking.

3. **SudokuGame**: This class will manage the game logic.
   - `__init__(self)`: Initialize the game with a Sudoku board.
   - `input_value(self, row, col, num)`: Allow the player to input a value.
   - `check_completion(self)`: Check if the puzzle is completed.

4. **main()**: The main function to run the application.

Now, let's implement the code for each file:

### sudoku_board.py

```python
'''

This module defines the SudokuBoard class which represents the Sudoku board and provides methods to manipulate and validate the board.

'''

class SudokuBoard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]

    def is_valid_move(self, row, col, num):
        # Check if the number is not already in the row, column, or 3x3 subgrid
        for i in range(9):
            if self.grid[row][i] == num or self.grid[i][col] == num:
                return False
        
        start_row, start_col = 3 * (row // 3), 3 * (col // 3)
        for i in range(3):
            for j in range(3):
                if self.grid[start_row + i][start_col + j] == num:
                    return False
        
        return True

    def place_number(self, row, col, num):
        if self.is_valid_move(row, col, num):
            self.grid[row][col] = num
            return True
        return False

    def remove_number(self, row, col):
        self.grid[row][col] = 0

    def is_complete(self):
        for row in self.grid:
            if 0 in row:
                return False
        return True
```

### sudoku_solver.py

```python
'''

This module defines the SudokuSolver class which provides a method to solve a Sudoku puzzle using backtracking.

'''

from sudoku_board import SudokuBoard

class SudokuSolver:
    def solve(self, board):
        for row in range(9):
            for col in range(9):
                if board.grid[row][col] == 0:
                    for num in range(1, 10):
                        if board.place_number(row, col, num):
                            if self.solve(board):
                                return True
                            board.remove_number(row, col)
                    return False
        return True
```

### sudoku_game.py

```python
'''

This module defines the SudokuGame class which manages the game logic and allows player interaction.

'''

from sudoku_board import SudokuBoard
from sudoku_solver import SudokuSolver

class SudokuGame:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = SudokuBoard()
        self.solver = SudokuSolver()

    def input_value(self, row, col, num):
        return self.board.place_number(row, col, num)

    def check_completion(self):
        return self.board.is_complete()
```

### main.py

```python
'''

This is the main module that runs the Sudoku application, allowing users to interact with the Sudoku game.

'''

from sudoku_game import SudokuGame

def main():
    game = SudokuGame()
    # Example interaction
    game.input_value(0, 0, 5)
    game.input_value(0, 1, 3)
    # More interactions can be added here

    if game.check_completion():
        print("Congratulations! The Sudoku puzzle is complete.")
    else:
        print("The Sudoku puzzle is not yet complete.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code provides a basic structure for a Sudoku solver/creator application. It allows for placing numbers, checking for valid moves, and solving the puzzle using backtracking. The main function demonstrates a simple interaction with the game.

The highest priority comment is regarding user interaction and feedback. The current implementation lacks a mechanism for the user to input values interactively and receive feedback on mistakes. The program should allow users to input values for specific cells, check for mistakes, and confirm when the puzzle is completed, as per the task requirements.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
1. Implement a user interface (either command-line or graphical) that allows users to input values for specific cells.
2. Add functionality to check for mistakes immediately after a user inputs a value. This can be done by modifying the `input_value` method in the `SudokuGame` class to return feedback on whether the move was valid or not.
3. Provide clear instructions and feedback to the user, such as indicating invalid moves or confirming when the puzzle is completed.

By addressing these points, the application will better meet the user's requirements for interaction and feedback.

Comments on Codes:
"The highest priority comment is regarding user interaction and feedback. The current implementation lacks a mechanism for the user to input values interactively and receive feedback on mistakes. The program should allow users to input values for specific cells, check for mistakes, and confirm when the puzzle is completed, as per the task requirements.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
1. Implement a user interface (either command-line or graphical) that allows users to input values for specific cells.
2. Add functionality to check for mistakes immediately after a user inputs a value. This can be done by modifying the `input_value` method in the `SudokuGame` class to return feedback on whether the move was valid or not.
3. Provide clear instructions and feedback to the user, such as indicating invalid moves or confirming when the puzzle is completed.

By addressing these points, the application will better meet the user's requirements for interaction and feedback."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

The program should allow the player to input values for specific cells, check for mistakes, and confirm when the puzzle is completed..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The current implementation lacks a feature to generate a Sudoku puzzle, which is a key part of the task requirement. The code only provides functionality for solving and interacting with a Sudoku puzzle, but not for creating one. To address this, you should implement a method within the `SudokuBoard` class to generate a valid Sudoku puzzle. This could involve creating a partially filled grid that adheres to Sudoku rules, ensuring there is a unique solution. Additionally, ensure that the user can interact with this generated puzzle in the `SudokuGame` class.

To fix this, you can follow these steps:

1. **Add a Puzzle Generator Method:**
   - Implement a method in the `SudokuBoard` class to generate a valid Sudoku puzzle. This can be done by filling the grid with a complete solution and then removing numbers while ensuring the puzzle remains solvable with a unique solution.

2. **Integrate Puzzle Generation in the Game:**
   - Modify the `SudokuGame` class to initialize the board with a generated puzzle. This can be done in the constructor or through a separate method that the user can call to start a new game.

3. **Update User Interaction:**
   - Ensure that the user can start a new game with a generated puzzle and interact with it as currently implemented.

By implementing these changes, the application will fully meet the user's requirements by allowing both puzzle creation and solving.

Comments on Codes:
"The current implementation lacks a feature to generate a Sudoku puzzle, which is a key part of the task requirement. The code only provides functionality for solving and interacting with a Sudoku puzzle, but not for creating one. To address this, you should implement a method within the `SudokuBoard` class to generate a valid Sudoku puzzle. This could involve creating a partially filled grid that adheres to Sudoku rules, ensuring there is a unique solution. Additionally, ensure that the user can interact with this generated puzzle in the `SudokuGame` class.

To fix this, you can follow these steps:

1. **Add a Puzzle Generator Method:**
   - Implement a method in the `SudokuBoard` class to generate a valid Sudoku puzzle. This can be done by filling the grid with a complete solution and then removing numbers while ensuring the puzzle remains solvable with a unique solution.

2. **Integrate Puzzle Generation in the Game:**
   - Modify the `SudokuGame` class to initialize the board with a generated puzzle. This can be done in the constructor or through a separate method that the user can call to start a new game.

3. **Update User Interaction:**
   - Ensure that the user can start a new game with a generated puzzle and interact with it as currently implemented.

By implementing these changes, the application will fully meet the user's requirements by allowing both puzzle creation and solving."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Add a Puzzle Generator Method:\n   - Implement a method in the SudokuBoard class to generate a valid Sudoku puzzle. This can be done by filling the grid with a complete solution and then removing numbers while ensuring the puzzle remains solvable with a unique solution.\n\n2. Integrate Puzzle Generation in the Game:\n   - Modify the SudokuGame class to initialize the board with a generated puzzle. This can be done in the constructor or through a separate method that the user can call to start a new game.\n\n3. Update User Interaction:\n   - Ensure that the user can start a new game with a generated puzzle and interact with it as currently implemented.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the application will fully meet the user's requirements by allowing both puzzle creation and solving."} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The highest priority issue in the provided code is that the `SudokuSolver` class is being used in the `SudokuBoard` class's `generate_puzzle` method without being properly instantiated or imported. The `SudokuSolver` class is defined in a separate module (`sudoku_solver.py`), but it is not imported in `sudoku_board.py`. This will lead to a `NameError` when trying to use `SudokuSolver()` in the `generate_puzzle` method.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
1. Import the `SudokuSolver` class in `sudoku_board.py` by adding the following line at the top of the file:
   ```python
   from sudoku_solver import SudokuSolver
   ```

This will ensure that the `SudokuSolver` class is available for use in the `SudokuBoard` class, allowing the `generate_puzzle` method to function correctly.

Comments on Codes:
"The highest priority issue in the provided code is that the `SudokuSolver` class is being used in the `SudokuBoard` class's `generate_puzzle` method without being properly instantiated or imported. The `SudokuSolver` class is defined in a separate module (`sudoku_solver.py`), but it is not imported in `sudoku_board.py`. This will lead to a `NameError` when trying to use `SudokuSolver()` in the `generate_puzzle` method.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
1. Import the `SudokuSolver` class in `sudoku_board.py` by adding the following line at the top of the file:
   ```python

This will ensure that the `SudokuSolver` class is available for use in the `SudokuBoard` class, allowing the `generate_puzzle` method to function correctly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Software Test Engineer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to design and execute tests to ensure the quality and functionality of software products. You develop test plans, create test cases, and report on software performance. You identify defects and collaborate with the development team to resolve them.
You need to ensure that the software is working as expected and meets the customer's requirements.

You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with programmers and code reviewers.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a classic Sudoku puzzle solver/creator that uses a 9x9 grid. Each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain the digits 1 through 9 exactly once. The program should allow the player to input values for specific cells, check for mistakes, and confirm when the puzzle is completed..
To complete the task, you will design and implement test procedures, report issues found, and verify that the software meets the customer's requirements.]

The error message indicates that there is a circular import issue between the `sudoku_board.py` and `sudoku_solver.py` modules. Here's a summary of the problem:

1. **Circular Import**: 
   - In `sudoku_board.py`, the `SudokuBoard` class imports `SudokuSolver` from `sudoku_solver.py`.
   - In `sudoku_solver.py`, the `SudokuSolver` class imports `SudokuBoard` from `sudoku_board.py`.

This creates a circular dependency because each module is trying to import the other before it has been fully initialized. Python cannot resolve this circular import, leading to the `ImportError`.

### Solution:
To resolve this issue, you can refactor the code to eliminate the circular dependency. Here are a few approaches:

1. **Combine Classes**: If feasible, combine the `SudokuBoard` and `SudokuSolver` classes into a single module if they are tightly coupled and don't need to be separated.

2. **Dependency Injection**: Modify the `SudokuSolver` class to accept a board as a parameter in its methods instead of importing `SudokuBoard`.

3. **Reorganize Imports**: Move the import statements inside the functions or methods where they are used, to delay the import until after the module is initialized.

By implementing one of these solutions, you can break the circular dependency and resolve the import error.

Error Summary of Test Reports:
"The error message indicates that there is a circular import issue between the `sudoku_board.py` and `sudoku_solver.py` modules. Here's a summary of the problem:

1. **Circular Import**: 
   - In `sudoku_board.py`, the `SudokuBoard` class imports `SudokuSolver` from `sudoku_solver.py`.
   - In `sudoku_solver.py`, the `SudokuSolver` class imports `SudokuBoard` from `sudoku_board.py`.

This creates a circular dependency because each module is trying to import the other before it has been fully initialized. Python cannot resolve this circular import, leading to the `ImportError`.

### Solution:
To resolve this issue, you can refactor the code to eliminate the circular dependency. Here are a few approaches:

1. **Combine Classes**: If feasible, combine the `SudokuBoard` and `SudokuSolver` classes into a single module if they are tightly coupled and don't need to be separated.

2. **Dependency Injection**: Modify the `SudokuSolver` class to accept a board as a parameter in its methods instead of importing `SudokuBoard`.

3. **Reorganize Imports**: Move the import statements inside the functions or methods where they are used, to delay the import until after the module is initialized.

By implementing one of these solutions, you can break the circular dependency and resolve the import error."

Explanation:
- In `sudoku_board.py`, I moved the import statement for `SudokuSolver` inside the `generate_puzzle` method to avoid the circular import issue.
- In `sudoku_solver.py`, I removed the import statement for `SudokuBoard` since it is not needed for the `SudokuSolver` class to function. The `solve` method now takes a `board` parameter, which is expected to be an instance of `SudokuBoard`.

Python cannot resolve this circular import, leading to the ImportError.\n\n### Solution:\nTo resolve this issue, you can refactor the code to eliminate the circular dependency. Here are a few approaches:\n\n1. Combine Classes: If feasible, combine the SudokuBoard and SudokuSolver classes into a single module if they are tightly coupled and don't need to be separated.\n\n2. Dependency Injection: Modify the SudokuSolver class to accept a board as a parameter in its methods instead of importing SudokuBoard.\n\n3. Reorganize Imports: Move the import statements inside the functions or methods where they are used, to delay the import until after the module is initialized.\n\nBy implementing one of these solutions, you can break the circular dependency and resolve the import error."} |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Software Test Engineer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to design and execute tests to ensure the quality and functionality of software products. You develop test plans, create test cases, and report on software performance. You identify defects and collaborate with the development team to resolve them.
You need to ensure that the software is working as expected and meets the customer's requirements.
Check the edge cases and special cases and instances for the task we are doing. Do not miss any cases. Do not suffice with generic and superficial cases.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with programmers and code reviewers.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a classic Sudoku puzzle solver/creator that uses a 9x9 grid. Each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain the digits 1 through 9 exactly once. The program should allow the player to input values for specific cells, check for mistakes, and confirm when the puzzle is completed..
To complete the task, you will design and implement test procedures, report issues found, and verify that the software meets the customer's requirements.]

The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `generate_puzzle` method of the `SudokuBoard` class. Specifically, the error occurs when attempting to create a new `SudokuBoard` instance with `SudokuBoard(board_copy)`. The `SudokuBoard` class's `__init__` method is defined to take no arguments other than `self`, but the code is attempting to pass `board_copy` as an argument.

Here is a summary of the bug:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `SudokuBoard`:** The `SudokuBoard` class is being initialized with an argument (`board_copy`), but its `__init__` method does not accept any arguments. This results in a `TypeError`.

To fix this issue, you need to modify the `SudokuBoard` class to accept an optional argument in its `__init__` method for initializing the board with a given grid. Here's a possible solution:

```python
class SudokuBoard:
    def __init__(self, grid=None):
        if grid:
            self.grid = grid
        else:
            self.grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]
```

With this change, the `SudokuBoard` can be initialized with an existing grid, allowing the `generate_puzzle` method to pass `board_copy` correctly.

Error Summary of Test Reports:
"The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `generate_puzzle` method of the `SudokuBoard` class. Specifically, the error occurs when attempting to create a new `SudokuBoard` instance with `SudokuBoard(board_copy)`. The `SudokuBoard` class's `__init__` method is defined to take no arguments other than `self`, but the code is attempting to pass `board_copy` as an argument.

Here is a summary of the bug:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `SudokuBoard`:** The `SudokuBoard` class is being initialized with an argument (`board_copy`), but its `__init__` method does not accept any arguments. This results in a `TypeError`.

To fix this issue, you need to modify the `SudokuBoard` class to accept an optional argument in its `__init__` method for initializing the board with a given grid. Here's a possible solution:

```python
class SudokuBoard:
    def __init__(self, grid=None):
        if grid:
            self.grid = grid
        else:
            self.grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]
```

With this change, the `SudokuBoard` can be initialized with an existing grid, allowing the `generate_puzzle` method to pass `board_copy` correctly."
Note that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary. Now, use the format exemplified above and modify the problematic codes based on the error summary. Output the codes that you fixed based on the test reported and corresponding explanations (strictly follow the format defined above, including FILENAME, LANGUAGE, DOCSTRING and CODE; incomplete "TODO" codes are strictly prohibited). If no bugs are reported, please return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of ChatDev. Your primary responsibilities include overseeing all technical aspects of the company. You establish the company's technical vision and lead technological development, ensuring that technology resources align with the company's business needs.
You report to the CEO and collaborate with other executives to integrate technology into the company's strategy.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a classic Sudoku puzzle solver/creator that uses a 9x9 grid. Each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain the digits 1 through 9 exactly once. The program should allow the player to input values for specific cells, check for mistakes, and confirm when the puzzle is completed..
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

Based on the provided code snippets, it appears that the project does not explicitly use any external libraries or packages that need to be included in a `requirements.txt` file. The code primarily relies on Python's standard library. However, if you plan to expand the project or if there are any hidden dependencies not shown in the code snippets, you might need to update the `requirements.txt` file accordingly.

For now, the `requirements.txt` file can be left empty or you can include a comment indicating that no external dependencies are required:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

If in the future you decide to add features that require additional libraries (e.g., a graphical user interface or advanced numerical computations), you would update this file to include those dependencies.

Programmer: Based on the provided code snippets, it appears that the project does not explicitly use any external libraries or packages that need to be included in a `requirements.txt` file. The code primarily relies on Python's standard library. However, if you plan to expand the project or if there are any hidden dependencies not shown in the code snippets, you might need to update the `requirements.txt` file accordingly.
For now, the `requirements.txt` file can be left empty or you can include a comment indicating that no external dependencies are required:

The program should allow the player to input values for specific cells, check for mistakes, and confirm when the puzzle is completed..
To complete the task, you will analyze the customer's requirements and provide recommendations based on your expertise.]

As the CEO, I appreciate the thorough analysis and response provided by the Programmer. Based on the current codebase, it seems that the project does not require any external libraries beyond Python's standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file can indeed be left empty or contain a comment indicating the absence of external dependencies.

However, I would like to ensure that our solution is robust and scalable for future enhancements. Here are a few strategic points to consider:

1. **Documentation**: Ensure that the code is well-documented, with clear comments and explanations for each function and class. This will facilitate future development and maintenance.

2. **Testing**: Implement a suite of unit tests to verify the correctness of the Sudoku solver and creator functionalities. This will help catch any potential bugs and ensure the reliability of the application.

3. **User Interface**: Consider the possibility of adding a graphical user interface (GUI) in the future to enhance user experience. If this is pursued, the `requirements.txt` file will need to be updated with the necessary GUI libraries (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt).

4. **Scalability**: Keep in mind potential scalability issues if the application is expanded to include more complex features or larger grids. Ensure that the code is modular and can be easily extended.

5. **Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a feedback mechanism for users to report issues or suggest improvements. This will help us continuously improve the product based on user input.

With these strategic considerations in mind, let's proceed with the current implementation and keep the `requirements.txt` file as follows:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

If there are any further developments or changes needed, please keep me informed. Let's continue to align our efforts with our mission of changing the digital world through programming.

2. **Testing**: Implement a suite of unit tests to verify the correctness of the Sudoku solver and creator functionalities. This will help catch any potential bugs and ensure the reliability of the application.

3. **User Interface**: Consider the possibility of adding a graphical user interface (GUI) in the future to enhance user experience. If this is pursued, the `requirements.txt` file will need to be updated with the necessary GUI libraries (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt).

4. **Scalability**: Keep in mind potential scalability issues if the application is expanded to include more complex features or larger grids. Ensure that the code is modular and can be easily extended.

5. **Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a feedback mechanism for users to report issues or suggest improvements. This will help us continuously improve the product based on user input.

With these strategic considerations in mind, let's proceed with the current implementation and keep the `requirements.txt` file as follows:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

If there are any further developments or changes needed, please keep me informed. Let's continue to align our efforts with our mission of changing the digital world through programming.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)
