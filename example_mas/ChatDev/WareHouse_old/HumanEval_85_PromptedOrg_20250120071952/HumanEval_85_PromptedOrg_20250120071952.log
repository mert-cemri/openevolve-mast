.
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `add(lst)` that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of even numbers that are located at odd indices in the list. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Function Name**: `add`
   - **Purpose**: To sum the even numbers that are located at odd indices in the given list.

2. **Logic**:
   - Iterate over the list using an index.
   - Check if the index is odd.
   - If the element at that index is even, add it to a running total.
   - Return the total sum.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

Given a non-empty list of integers lst. Add the even elements that are at odd indices.

Examples:
    add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 2 

'''

def add(lst):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):  # Start from index 1 and step by 2 to get odd indices
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:  # Check if the element at the odd index is even
            total += lst[i]
    return total

# Example usage:
# result = add([4, 2, 6, 7])
# print(result)  # Output should be 2
```

This code will correctly sum the even numbers located at odd indices in the list, as specified in the task.

The task has been completed correctly. The provided code in `main.py` effectively solves the problem by adding the even elements that are at odd indices in a list.

Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            
def add(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices..


    Examples:
        add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 2

To complete the task, you will provide strategic guidance and instructions to your team, ensuring that the solution meets the customer's needs and aligns with the company's objectives.]

# Add Function User Manual

This manual provides instructions on how to use the `add` function, which is designed to sum the even elements that are located at odd indices in a given non-empty list of integers.

## Main Functionality

The `add` function is a simple utility that processes a list of integers and returns the sum of even numbers that are found at odd indices. This function is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to filter and sum specific elements from a list based on their position and value.

### Function Definition

```python
def add(lst):
    """
    Given a non-empty list of integers lst, add the even elements that are at odd indices.

    Parameters:
    lst (list): A non-empty list of integers.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of the even elements at odd indices.
    
    Example:
    add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 2
    """
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):  # Start from index 1 and step by 2 to get odd indices
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:  # Check if the element at the odd index is even
            total += lst[i]
    return total
```

## Installation

No additional dependencies are required to use this function. It is implemented in pure Python and can be used in any Python environment.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Environment:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Create a Python Script:**
   - Copy the function definition into a Python file, e.g., `main.py`.

3. **Call the Function:**
   - You can call the `add` function by passing a list of integers as an argument. For example:

   ```python
   result = add([4, 2, 6, 7])
   print(result)  # Output will be 2
   ```

4. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script using a Python interpreter. In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing `main.py` and run:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Usage

Here is an example of how you can use the `add` function:

```python
# Example list
numbers = [10, 3, 4, 8, 5, 12]

# Call the add function
sum_even_at_odd_indices = add(numbers)

# Output the result
print(f"The sum of even numbers at odd indices is: {sum_even_at_odd_indices}")
```

In this example, the function will sum the even numbers located at indices 1, 3, and 5, resulting in an output of `8 + 12 = 20`.

## Conclusion

The `add` function is a straightforward and efficient utility for summing even integers located at odd indices in a list. It requires no additional libraries and can be easily integrated into any Python project.
