Given the task at hand, which involves writing and correcting a piece of software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task is inherently related to software development and requires implementing a functional piece of code. An application modality would allow us to focus on the code logic and ensure it works as desired without any additional presentation layers. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. Since the task involves writing and correcting software code, an "Application" modality is indeed the most appropriate choice. This will allow us to focus solely on the code functionality and ensure it meets the customer's requirements.

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To address the customer's task, we need to implement a function `correct_bracketing` that checks if every opening bracket "<" has a corresponding closing bracket ">". The task specifically asks for a solution without any GUI, so we will focus on implementing the function in a single Python file.

Here's the plan:

1. **Function: `correct_bracketing`**
   - **Purpose**: To determine if a string of brackets is correctly bracketed, meaning every "<" has a corresponding ">".
   - **Logic**: Use a counter to track the number of unmatched opening brackets. Increment the counter for each "<" and decrement for each ">". If the counter is negative at any point, or not zero at the end, the string is incorrectly bracketed.

Now, let's implement the solution in the `main.py` file.

### main.py

```python
'''

Function to check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

'''

def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    count = 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            count += 1
        elif char == '>':
            count -= 1
        # If count is negative, there are unmatched closing brackets
        if count < 0:
            return False
    # If count is zero, all brackets are matched
    return count == 0

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(correct_bracketing("<"))        # False
    print(correct_bracketing("<>"))       # True
    print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))   # True
    print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))     # False
```

This code defines the `correct_bracketing` function, which checks if the input string of brackets is correctly balanced. The function iterates through each character in the string, updating a counter based on whether the character is an opening or closing bracket. If the counter becomes negative at any point, it indicates an unmatched closing bracket, and the function returns `False`. If the counter is zero at the end, it means all brackets are matched, and the function returns `True`.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the given code, there are no external dependencies or packages required, as it only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, to adhere to best practices, you can still create an empty `requirements.txt` file to indicate that no additional packages are needed.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.

```
"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code, there are no external dependencies or packages required, as it only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, to adhere to best practices, you can still create an empty `requirements.txt` file to indicate that no additional packages are needed.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I agree with the Programmer's assessment. The provided code for the `correct_bracketing` function does not require any external libraries or packages beyond the standard Python library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, indicating that no additional dependencies are necessary for this project.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

This file serves as a placeholder to document that the project does not rely on any external packages, which is a good practice for maintaining clarity and organization in the project's structure.

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha
