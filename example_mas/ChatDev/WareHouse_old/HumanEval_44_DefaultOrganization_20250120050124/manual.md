# Change Base Software

This software provides a function to convert a given integer from base 10 to another numerical base less than 10. The function returns the string representation of the number in the new base.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str`. This function takes two arguments:
- `x`: A non-negative integer that you want to convert.
- `base`: The base to which you want to convert the number `x`. The base must be between 2 and 9.

### Example Usage

```python
print(change_base(8, 3))  # Output: '22'
print(change_base(8, 2))  # Output: '1000'
print(change_base(7, 2))  # Output: '111'
```

## Installation

There are no external dependencies required for this software, so you can run it with a standard Python environment.

### Quick Install

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How to Use

2. **Run the Script**: You can run the script directly using Python. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `main.py`. Then execute:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Modify the Code**: You can modify the `main.py` file to test other numbers and bases by changing the arguments in the `print` statements.
