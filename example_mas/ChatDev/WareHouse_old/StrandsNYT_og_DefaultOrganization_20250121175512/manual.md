# NYT Strands Puzzle Game

Welcome to the NYT Strands Puzzle Game! This interactive application allows players to connect word segments to form valid words or phrases. Each connected segment should produce a meaningful solution, and players receive confirmation for correct strand formations.

## Main Functions

- **Interactive Word Segments**: Players can click on word segments to select or deselect them. Selected segments are highlighted for easy identification.
- **Validation of Formed Words**: The game checks if the selected segments form a valid word or phrase from the predefined list.
- **User Feedback**: Players receive immediate feedback on their selections, indicating whether the formed word is correct or if they need to try again.

## Installation

### Environment Setup

To run the NYT Strands Puzzle Game, you need to have Python installed on your system. The game uses the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface, which is included with Python's standard library.

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**: You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have access to the code repository, clone it to your local machine.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the project files are located.

### Dependencies

The current setup does not require any external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. However, ensure that Tkinter is available in your Python installation.

## How to Play

1. **Launch the Game**: Run the `main.py` file to start the game. You can do this by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Game Interface**: Once the game starts, a window will appear displaying word segments as clickable buttons.

3. **Select Segments**: Click on the word segments to select them. Selected segments will be highlighted in light blue.

4. **Form Words**: Try to connect segments to form valid words or phrases. The goal is to select segments in the correct order to form a word from the predefined list.

5. **Receive Feedback**: After selecting segments, the game will provide feedback. If the formed word is correct, the segments will turn green. If not, you will be prompted to try again.

6. **Deselect Segments**: If you wish to change your selection, simply click on a highlighted segment to deselect it.

## Troubleshooting

- **Tkinter Errors**: If you encounter errors related to Tkinter, ensure that your Python installation includes Tkinter. On some systems, you may need to install it separately.

- **Display Issues**: If the application does not display correctly, ensure that your system supports GUI applications and that you have a display environment set up.
