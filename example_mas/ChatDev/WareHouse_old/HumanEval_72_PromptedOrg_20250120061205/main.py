'''
This module contains a function to determine if an object will fly based on its balance and weight.
'''
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    '''
    Returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.
    The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w.
    Example:
    will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) ➞ False 
    # 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.
    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) ➞ False
    # it's balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.
    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) ➞ True
    # 3+2+3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.
    will_it_fly([3], 5) ➞ True
    # 3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.
    '''
    # Check if the list is palindromic
    is_balanced = q == q[::-1]
    # Calculate the sum of the elements
    total_weight = sum(q)
    # Check if the sum is less than or equal to the maximum weight
    is_within_weight = total_weight <= w
    # Return True if both conditions are met
    return is_balanced and is_within_weight
