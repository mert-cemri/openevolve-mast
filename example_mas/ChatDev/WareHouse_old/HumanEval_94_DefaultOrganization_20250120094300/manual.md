# Prime Digit Sum Finder

This software provides a simple utility to find the largest prime number in a given list of integers and return the sum of its digits. It is designed to be efficient and easy to use, with no external dependencies required.

## Main Functions

The main function of this software is `skjkasdkd(lst)`, which performs the following tasks:
- Iterates through a list of integers.
- Identifies the largest prime number in the list.
- Calculates and returns the sum of the digits of this largest prime number.

### Supporting Functions

1. **is_prime(n)**: 
   - Checks if a given number `n` is a prime number.
   - Returns `True` if `n` is prime, otherwise `False`.

2. **sum_of_digits(n)**:
   - Computes the sum of the digits of a given number `n`.
   - Returns the sum as an integer.
