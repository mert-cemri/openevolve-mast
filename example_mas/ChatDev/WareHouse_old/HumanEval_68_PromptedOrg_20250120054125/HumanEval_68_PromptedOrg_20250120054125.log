    "Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes
    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.
    If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index.

    The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],
    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].

    Example 1:
        Input: [4,2,3]

        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.

    Example 2:
        Input: [1,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To solve the task, we need to implement the `pluck` function in Python. This function will iterate through the given array, identify the smallest even number, and return it along with its index. If there are no even numbers or the array is empty, it will return an empty list.

Here is the plan:

1. **Function Name**: `pluck`
   - **Purpose**: To find the smallest even number in an array and return it along with its index.
   - **Input**: A list of non-negative integers.
   - **Output**: A list containing the smallest even number and its index, or an empty list if no even numbers are found.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

You report to the technical lead or CTO and work closely with programmers.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are the Chief Product Officer (CPO) of ChatDev. Your primary responsibilities include defining and overseeing the product strategy and roadmap, ensuring that products meet customer needs and align with the company's overall strategy. You work closely with cross-functional teams to guide product development from conception to launch.
You report to the CEO and collaborate with other executives to align product initiatives with company objectives.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            
def pluck(arr):
    """
    "Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes
    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.
    If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index.

    The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],
    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].

    Example 1:

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

# Pluck Function User Manual

Welcome to the user manual for the `pluck` function. This document will guide you through the main functionalities of the software, how to install the necessary environment dependencies, and how to use the function effectively.

## Introduction

The `pluck` function is designed to process an array of non-negative integers and identify the smallest even number within it. The function returns this number along with its index in the array. If there are multiple occurrences of the smallest even number, the function will return the first occurrence. If no even numbers are present, or if the array is empty, the function will return an empty list.

## Main Functionality

- **Identify Smallest Even Number**: The function scans through the provided array to find the smallest even number.
- **Return Index**: Along with the smallest even number, the function returns the index of its first occurrence.
- **Handle Edge Cases**: If the array is empty or contains no even numbers, the function returns an empty list.

## Installation

The `pluck` function is implemented in Python. To use it, you need to have Python installed on your system. There are no additional dependencies required for this function.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or Download the Code**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the `pluck` function. You can clone the repository or download the file directly.

3. **Run the Function**: You can run the function using any Python environment or directly from the command line.

## How to Use

1. **Import the Function**: If you are using the function in another script, make sure to import it:

   ```python
   from main import pluck
   ```

2. **Call the Function**: Pass an array of non-negative integers to the function:

   ```python
   result = pluck([4, 2, 3])
   print(result)  # Output: [2, 1]
   ```

3. **Interpret the Output**: The function will return a list containing the smallest even number and its index. If no even numbers are found, it will return an empty list.

   ```python
   result = pluck([1, 3, 5])
   print(result)  # Output: []
   ```

## Examples

- **Example 1**: Input: `[4, 2, 3]`  
  Output: `[2, 1]`  
  Explanation: 2 is the smallest even number and is at index 1.

- **Example 2**: Input: `[5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]`  
  Output: `[0, 1]`  
  Explanation: 0 is the smallest even number, and the first occurrence is at index 1.

- **Example 3**: Input: `[]`  
  Output: `[]`  
  Explanation: The array is empty, so the output is an empty list.

## Conclusion

The `pluck` function is a simple yet effective tool for identifying the smallest even number in an array of non-negative integers. It is easy to integrate into larger projects and requires no additional dependencies. We hope this manual helps you understand and utilize the function effectively. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to reach out.
