Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and testing a function in Python, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to focus on implementing and verifying the functionality of the code. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, we need to implement the function `any_int` in Python as specified by the customer. The function should take three numbers and return `True` if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two and all numbers are integers. Otherwise, it should return `False`.

Since the customer explicitly requested not to implement a GUI interface and to only write the necessary code, we will focus solely on implementing the function in a single file, `main.py`.

Here is the implementation:

main.py

```python
'''
This module contains the function any_int which checks if one of the three given numbers
is equal to the sum of the other two, provided all numbers are integers.
'''

def any_int(x, y, z):
    '''
    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.

    Examples:
    any_int(5, 2, 7) ➞ True
    any_int(3, 2, 2) ➞ False
    any_int(3, -2, 1) ➞ True
    any_int(3.6, -2.2, 2) ➞ False
    '''
    # Check if all numbers are integers
    if not all(isinstance(i, int) for i in (x, y, z)):
        return False
    
    # Check if any one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two
    return x == y + z or y == x + z or z == x + y
```

This code defines the `any_int` function, which checks the conditions specified in the task. It first verifies that all inputs are integers and then checks if any one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two. If both conditions are met, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The function `any_int` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should be empty or not necessary. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not require any additional packages beyond the standard Python library.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:
