Given the task at hand, which involves writing and fixing a piece of software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task is centered around developing a functional piece of software code, which aligns with the capabilities of an Application product modality. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" is indeed the most appropriate product modality for this task, as it involves writing and fixing a piece of software code. This aligns well with the nature of an Application, which is designed to implement software solutions. Let's proceed with this modality.

To solve the task, we need to implement the `correct_bracketing` function in Python. This function will check if every opening bracket `<` has a corresponding closing bracket `>`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Function Name**: `correct_bracketing`
   - **Purpose**: To determine if a string of brackets is correctly balanced, meaning every `<` has a corresponding `>`.

2. **Logic**:
   - Use a counter to keep track of the number of unmatched opening brackets `<`.
   - Iterate through each character in the string:
     - If the character is `<`, increment the counter.
     - If the character is `>`, decrement the counter.
     - If at any point the counter becomes negative, return `False` because it means there is a closing bracket `>` without a matching opening bracket `<`.
   - After iterating through the string, if the counter is zero, return `True` (all brackets are matched); otherwise, return `False`.

Now, let's implement this logic in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python

'''

This module contains the function correct_bracketing which checks if a string of brackets is correctly balanced.

'''

def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """ brackets is a string of "<" and ">".

    >>> correct_bracketing("<")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("<>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
    False
    """
    balance = 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '>':
            balance -= 1
        if balance < 0:
            return False
    return balance == 0

```

This code should correctly implement the functionality as described in the task. The function `correct_bracketing` will return `True` if the brackets are balanced and `False` otherwise.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the given code, there are no external dependencies or packages required as it only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you want to include a Python version specification, you can do so. Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

```
# No external packages required
# Optionally specify Python version
# python_version >= "3.6"
```

If you want to specify a minimum Python version, you can uncomment the last line and adjust the version as needed.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```

```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code, there are no external dependencies or packages required as it only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you want to include a Python version specification, you can do so. Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:
```
# No external packages required
# Optionally specify Python version
# python_version >= "3.6"
```
If you want to specify a minimum Python version, you can uncomment the last line and adjust the version as needed. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

The programmer has correctly identified that the given code does not require any external dependencies or packages, as it only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would indeed be empty. However, specifying a minimum Python version can be a good practice to ensure compatibility. Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

```
# No external packages required
# Optionally specify Python version
# python_version >= "3.6"
```

If you decide to specify a minimum Python version, you can uncomment the last line and adjust the version as needed. This file format aligns with the project's requirements and ensures that anyone using the code knows that no additional packages are needed.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

### Function Definition

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """ brackets is a string of "<" and ">".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
    """
```

### Example Usage

```python
>>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
