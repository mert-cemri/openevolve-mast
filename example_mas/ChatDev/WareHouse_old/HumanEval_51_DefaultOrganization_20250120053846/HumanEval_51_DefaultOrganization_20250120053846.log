Given the task at hand, which involves writing a function to remove vowels from a string, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task involves implementing a software tool using Python, which aligns with the capabilities of an Application. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" is indeed the most appropriate product modality for this task, as it involves implementing a Python function to manipulate text. This aligns well with the nature of software tools and applications.

To complete the task, we need to implement the `remove_vowels` function in Python. The task specifically asks for a solution without a GUI, so we will focus on creating a simple Python script that fulfills the requirements.

### Core Function

- **remove_vowels(text):** This function will take a string as input and return a new string with all vowels removed. It will handle both uppercase and lowercase vowels.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python
'''

This module contains a function to remove vowels from a given string.

'''

def remove_vowels(text):
    """
    remove_vowels is a function that takes a string and returns a string without vowels.
    >>> remove_vowels('')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")
    'bcdf\nghjklm'
    >>> remove_vowels('abcdef')
    'bcdf'
    >>> remove_vowels('aaaaa')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels('aaBAA')
    'B'
    >>> remove_vowels('zbcd')
    'zbcd'
    """
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return ''.join(char for char in text if char not in vowels)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
```

### Explanation

- **remove_vowels Function:** This function uses a generator expression within the `join` method to iterate over each character in the input string `text`. It checks if the character is not in the string `vowels`, which contains all lowercase and uppercase vowels. If the character is not a vowel, it is included in the resulting string.

- **doctest:** The `doctest` module is used to run the examples provided in the function's docstring. This helps ensure that the function behaves as expected.

This implementation meets the requirements by providing a functional solution to remove vowels from a string without any additional GUI components.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

The error message indicates that there is an issue with the leading whitespace in the docstring of the `remove_vowels` function. Specifically, the error is pointing to line 6 of the docstring, which contains the example `remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")`.

The problem arises because the expected output `'bcdf\nghjklm'` is not aligned correctly with the other lines in the docstring. In Python's doctest, the expected output lines must have consistent leading whitespace to match the indentation level of the `>>>` prompt.

To fix this issue, ensure that the expected output lines in the docstring are aligned properly with the `>>>` prompt. Here's the corrected version of the docstring:

```python
def remove_vowels(text):
    """
    remove_vowels is a function that takes a string and returns a string without vowels.
    >>> remove_vowels('')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")

    'zbcd'
    """
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return ''.join(char for char in text if char not in vowels)
```

Make sure that the expected output lines are aligned with the `>>>` prompt, and this should resolve the `ValueError` related to inconsistent leading whitespace.

Error Summary of Test Reports:
"The error message indicates that there is an issue with the leading whitespace in the docstring of the `remove_vowels` function. Specifically, the error is pointing to line 6 of the docstring, which contains the example `remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")`.

The problem arises because the expected output `'bcdf\nghjklm'` is not aligned correctly with the other lines in the docstring. In Python's doctest, the expected output lines must have consistent leading whitespace to match the indentation level of the `>>>` prompt.

To fix this issue, ensure that the expected output lines in the docstring are aligned properly with the `>>>` prompt. Here's the corrected version of the docstring:

```python
def remove_vowels(text):
    """
    remove_vowels is a function that takes a string and returns a string without vowels.
    >>> remove_vowels('')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")
    'bcdf\nghjklm'
    >>> remove_vowels('abcdef')
    'bcdf'
    >>> remove_vowels('aaaaa')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels('aaBAA')
    'B'
    >>> remove_vowels('zbcd')
    'zbcd'
    """
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return ''.join(char for char in text if char not in vowels)
```

Make sure that the expected output lines are aligned with the `>>>` prompt, and this should resolve the `ValueError` related to inconsistent leading whitespace."
Note that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary. Now, use the format exemplified above and modify the problematic codes based on the error summary. Output the codes that you fixed based on the test reported and corresponding explanations (strictly follow the format defined above, including FILENAME, LANGUAGE, DOCSTRING and CODE; incomplete "TODO" codes are strictly prohibited). If no bugs are reported, please return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The error message indicates that there is an issue with the leading whitespace in the docstring of the `remove_vowels` function. Specifically, the error is pointing to line 6 of the docstring, which is part of the example:

```python
>>> remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")
'bcdf\nghjklm'
```

The problem arises because the expected output line `'bcdf\nghjklm'` has inconsistent leading whitespace compared to the other lines in the docstring. In Python's doctest, the expected output must have the same indentation as the `>>>` line that precedes it.

To fix this issue, ensure that all lines in the docstring have consistent leading whitespace. Here's the corrected version of the docstring:

```python
def remove_vowels(text):
    """
    remove_vowels is a function that takes a string and returns a string without vowels.
    >>> remove_vowels('')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")

    """
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return ''.join(char for char in text if char not in vowels)

Make sure that the expected output lines are aligned with the `>>>` lines, and this should resolve the issue with the doctest.

Error Summary of Test Reports:
"The error message indicates that there is an issue with the leading whitespace in the docstring of the `remove_vowels` function. Specifically, the error is pointing to line 6 of the docstring, which is part of the example:

```python
>>> remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")
'bcdf\nghjklm'
```

The problem arises because the expected output line `'bcdf\nghjklm'` has inconsistent leading whitespace compared to the other lines in the docstring. In Python's doctest, the expected output must have the same indentation as the `>>>` line that precedes it.

To fix this issue, ensure that all lines in the docstring have consistent leading whitespace. Here's the corrected version of the docstring:

```python
def remove_vowels(text):
    """
    remove_vowels is a function that takes a string and returns a string without vowels.
    >>> remove_vowels('')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")

    'zbcd'
    """
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return ''.join(char for char in text if char not in vowels)
```

Make sure that the expected output lines are aligned with the `>>>` lines, and this should resolve the issue with the doctest."
Note that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary. Now, use the format exemplified above and modify the problematic codes based on the error summary. Output the codes that you fixed based on the test reported and corresponding explanations (strictly follow the format defined above, including FILENAME, LANGUAGE, DOCSTRING and CODE; incomplete "TODO" codes are strictly prohibited). If no bugs are reported, please return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the provided Python code, the only external library used is `doctest`, which is part of Python's standard library. Therefore, there are no additional external dependencies required for this project. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file to document this, it would simply be empty or you could include a comment indicating that no external packages are needed.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

This comment is optional, but it can be helpful for anyone reviewing the project to understand that the absence of listed packages is intentional.
