# Greatest Common Divisor Calculator

This software provides a simple and efficient way to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers without leaving a remainder.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is:

- `greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int`: This function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their greatest common divisor. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD.

### Example Usage

```python
>>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
1
>>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
5
```

## Installation

This software is implemented in Python and does not require any external dependencies. To use the software, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.

3. **Run the Python Script**: You can run the script using the Python interpreter. Open a Python shell or create a new Python script and import the `greatest_common_divisor` function.

```bash
python
```

```python
from main import greatest_common_divisor

# Example usage
result = greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
print(f"The GCD of 25 and 15 is: {result}")
```

## Documentation

The function is documented with docstrings that provide information on how to use it. You can also run the function with different integer inputs to calculate their GCD.
