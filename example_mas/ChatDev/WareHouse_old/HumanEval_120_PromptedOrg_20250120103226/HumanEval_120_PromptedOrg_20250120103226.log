We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To solve the given task, we need to implement a function named `maximum` that takes an array of integers and a positive integer `k`, and returns a sorted list of the maximum `k` numbers in the array. The function should handle edge cases and adhere to the constraints provided.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what needs to be done:

1. **Function Definition**: Define the function `maximum(arr, k)` which takes two parameters: `arr` (a list of integers) and `k` (an integer).

2. **Edge Case Handling**: Ensure that the function handles cases where `k` is zero, which should return an empty list.

3. **Sorting and Slicing**: Sort the array in descending order to easily access the largest `k` elements. Then, slice the first `k` elements from this sorted list.

4. **Final Sorting**: Sort the resulting list of `k` maximum elements in ascending order before returning, as specified in the examples.

5. **Return the Result**: Return the sorted list of maximum `k` elements.

Now, let's implement this in the `main.py` file.

```python

Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list

Example 2:

Example 3:

    Output: [2]

Note:
    1. The length of the array will be in the range of [1, 1000].
    2. The elements in the array will be in the range of [-1000, 1000].
    3. 0 <= k <= len(arr)

def maximum(arr, k):

    # Sort the array in descending order

    max_k_elements = sorted_arr[:k]

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

# Maximum K Elements Finder

This software provides a simple and efficient way to find the maximum `k` numbers from a given list of integers. It is designed to handle arrays with lengths ranging from 1 to 1000 and integer values between -1000 and 1000. The software returns a sorted list of the `k` largest numbers in ascending order.

## Main Functionality

The main function of this software is:

- **maximum(arr, k):** Given an array `arr` of integers and a positive integer `k`, this function returns a sorted list of length `k` with the maximum `k` numbers in `arr`.

### Examples

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `arr = [-3, -4, 5]`, `k = 3`
   - Output: `[-4, -3, 5]`

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `arr = [4, -4, 4]`, `k = 2`
   - Output: `[4, 4]`

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1]`, `k = 1`
   - Output: `[2]`

## Installation

This software is implemented in Python and does not require any external dependencies. You can use it directly in your Python environment.

### Quick Install

To use this software, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**

   Change into the directory where the `main.py` file is located:

   ```bash
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**

   You can run the code by executing the `main.py` file. Ensure you have your Python environment set up correctly.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Use the Function:**

   You can use the `maximum` function in your Python scripts by importing it from `main.py`. Here is an example of how to use it:

   ```python
   from main import maximum

   arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1]
   k = 1
   result = maximum(arr, k)
   print(result)  # Output: [2]
   ```

## Documentation

For more detailed documentation, please refer to the comments within the `main.py` file. The function is well-documented with examples and edge cases to help you understand its usage.

## Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please feel free to reach out to our support team or open an issue in the repository.

---

This user manual provides all the necessary information to install, use, and understand the functionality of the Maximum K Elements Finder software. Enjoy using the software to solve your array processing tasks efficiently!

This software provides a simple and efficient way to find the maximum `k` numbers from a given list of integers. It is designed to handle arrays with lengths ranging from 1 to 1000 and integer values between -1000 and 1000. The software returns a sorted list of the `k` largest numbers in ascending order.

## Main Functionality

The main function of this software is:

- **maximum(arr, k):** Given an array `arr` of integers and a positive integer `k`, this function returns a sorted list of length `k` with the maximum `k` numbers in `arr`.

### Examples

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `arr = [-3, -4, 5]`, `k = 3`
   - Output: `[-4, -3, 5]`

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `arr = [4, -4, 4]`, `k = 2`
   - Output: `[4, 4]`

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1]`, `k = 1`
   - Output: `[2]`
