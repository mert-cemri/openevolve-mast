Given the task at hand, which involves writing a piece of software code to solve a specific problem, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a functional piece of code, which aligns with the nature of software applications. What are your thoughts on this?

To solve the task, we need to implement the `prime_fib` function that returns the n-th Fibonacci number that is also a prime number. Here's how we can break down the task:

1. **Fibonacci Sequence Generator**: We need a function to generate Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Prime Checker**: A function to check if a number is prime.
3. **Main Function**: The `prime_fib` function that uses the above two utilities to find the n-th prime Fibonacci number.

Let's define the necessary functions and then implement them in the `main.py` file.

### Core Functions and Purpose

- **is_prime(num: int) -> bool**: Checks if a given number is prime.
- **fibonacci_generator() -> Generator[int, None, None]**: Generates Fibonacci numbers indefinitely.
- **prime_fib(n: int) -> int**: Finds the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime.

Now, let's implement these functions in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python
'''

This module contains the implementation of the prime_fib function which returns the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime.

def is_prime(num: int) -> bool:
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:

    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def fibonacci_generator():
    """Generate Fibonacci numbers indefinitely."""
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield b
        a, b = b, a + b

    """

    fib_gen = fibonacci_generator()
    count = 0
    while True:

        if is_prime(fib_num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return fib_num

```

This code defines the necessary functions to solve the task. The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime, the `fibonacci_generator` function generates Fibonacci numbers, and the `prime_fib` function uses these utilities to find the n-th prime Fibonacci number.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
