To address the customer's task, we need to implement the `parse_nested_parens` function in Python. The task does not require a GUI, contrary to the additional instructions provided. Therefore, we will focus solely on implementing the function to solve the problem as described.

### Core Function

- **Function Name**: `parse_nested_parens`
  - **Purpose**: To calculate the deepest level of nested parentheses for each group of parentheses in a given string.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Split the Input String**: The input string is split into separate groups of parentheses using spaces as delimiters.
2. **Calculate Nesting Levels**: For each group, calculate the maximum depth of nested parentheses.
3. **Return the Results**: Return a list of integers representing the maximum nesting level for each group.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

#### main.py

```python
# main.py

from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """ Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.
    For each of the group, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.
    E.g. (()()) has maximum two levels of nesting while ((())) has three.

    >>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
    [2, 3, 1, 3]
    """
    def max_nesting_level(paren_group: str) -> int:
        max_depth = 0
        current_depth = 0
        for char in paren_group:
            if char == '(':
                current_depth += 1
                if current_depth > max_depth:
                    max_depth = current_depth
            elif char == ')':
                current_depth -= 1
        return max_depth

    groups = paren_string.split()
    return [max_nesting_level(group) for group in groups]

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_input = '(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'
    print(parse_nested_parens(example_input))  # Output: [2, 3, 1, 3]
```

### Explanation

- **max_nesting_level Function**: This helper function calculates the maximum depth of nested parentheses for a single group by iterating through each character and adjusting the current depth accordingly.
- **parse_nested_parens Function**: This function splits the input string into groups and applies the `max_nesting_level` function to each group, collecting the results in a list.

This implementation directly addresses the customer's task without unnecessary complexity or GUI elements.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Based on the provided code, there are no external libraries or packages being used other than the standard Python library. Therefore, a `requirements.txt` file is not necessary for this project. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can leave it empty or include a comment indicating that no additional packages are required.

Here is an example of what the `requirements.txt` file could look like:

```

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external libraries or packages being used other than the standard Python library. Therefore, a `requirements.txt` file is not necessary for this project. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can leave it empty or include a comment indicating that no additional packages are required.
Here is an example of what the `requirements.txt` file could look like:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```
This file serves as a placeholder to indicate that the project does not rely on any third-party packages. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Parse Nested Parentheses

This software provides a function to analyze strings containing multiple groups of nested parentheses and determine the deepest level of nesting for each group. It is a simple utility written in Python, designed to handle strings of parentheses and return a list of integers representing the maximum nesting depth for each group.

## Main Functions

The core function of this software is:

- `parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]`: This function takes a string input where multiple groups of nested parentheses are separated by spaces. It returns a list of integers, each representing the deepest level of nesting for the corresponding group of parentheses.

### Example

Given the input string `'(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'`, the function will return `[2, 3, 1, 3]`, indicating the maximum nesting levels for each group of parentheses.

## Installation

### Environment Setup

This project does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to set up. You only need Python installed on your system.

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If the code is hosted in a repository, clone it to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

4. **Run the Script**: You can execute the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

To use the `parse_nested_parens` function, you can either run the provided `main.py` script or import the function into your own Python scripts.

### Running the Script

The `main.py` script includes an example usage of the `parse_nested_parens` function. Simply run the script to see the output for the example input:

 # Parse Nested Parentheses

This software provides a function to analyze strings containing multiple groups of nested parentheses and determine the deepest level of nesting for each group. It is a simple utility written in Python, designed to handle strings of parentheses and return a list of integers representing the maximum nesting depth for each group.

## Main Functions

The core function of this software is:

- `parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]`: This function takes a string input where multiple groups of nested parentheses are separated by spaces. It returns a list of integers, each representing the deepest level of nesting for the corresponding group of parentheses.

### Example

Given the input string `'(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'`, the function will return `[2, 3, 1, 3]`, indicating the maximum nesting levels for each group of parentheses.
