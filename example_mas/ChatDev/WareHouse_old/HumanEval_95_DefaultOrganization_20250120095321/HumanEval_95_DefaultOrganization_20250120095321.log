Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and testing a piece of software code, I believe the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This would allow us to implement the code and ensure it functions as required. What are your thoughts on this?

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To complete the task, we need to implement the `check_dict_case` function as specified in the task description. Since the task explicitly states not to implement a GUI interface or anything redundant, we will focus solely on the function implementation in Python. 

Here is the implementation of the function in the `main.py` file:

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to check if all keys in a dictionary are either all lowercase strings or all uppercase strings.

    all_lower = all(key.islower() for key in keys)
    all_upper = all(key.isupper() for key in keys)

```

This code defines the `check_dict_case` function, which checks if all keys in a given dictionary are either all lowercase strings or all uppercase strings. If the dictionary is empty or contains non-string keys, the function returns `False`.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# CheckDictCase

A simple Python utility to verify if all keys in a dictionary are either all lowercase strings or all uppercase strings.

## Overview

The `check_dict_case` function is designed to help you determine the case consistency of dictionary keys. It checks if all keys are strings and whether they are all in lowercase or uppercase. If the dictionary is empty or contains non-string keys, the function will return `False`.

## Features

- **Case Consistency Check**: Determines if all keys in a dictionary are either all lowercase or all uppercase strings.
- **Validation**: Ensures that all keys are strings before performing the case check.
- **Empty Dictionary Handling**: Returns `False` if the dictionary is empty.

## Installation

This utility does not require any external dependencies. You only need Python installed on your system.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**: (if applicable)
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Ensure Python is Installed**: Verify that Python is installed on your system by running:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

3. **Run the Script**: No additional installation steps are required. You can directly use the function in your Python environment.

## Usage

To use the `check_dict_case` function, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Function**: Ensure the function is available in your script or Python environment.
   ```python
   from main import check_dict_case
   ```

2. **Call the Function**: Pass a dictionary to the function to check the case consistency of its keys.
   ```python
   result = check_dict_case({"a": "apple", "b": "banana"})
   print(result)  # Output: True

   result = check_dict_case({"a": "apple", "A": "banana", "B": "banana"})
   print(result)  # Output: False
   ```

## Examples

Here are some examples to illustrate the usage of the `check_dict_case` function:

- **All Lowercase Keys**:
  ```python
  print(check_dict_case({"a": "apple", "b": "banana"}))  # Output: True
  ```

- **Mixed Case Keys**:
  ```python
  print(check_dict_case({"a": "apple", "A": "banana", "B": "banana"}))  # Output: False
  ```

- **Non-String Key**:
  ```python
  print(check_dict_case({"a": "apple", 8: "banana", "a": "apple"}))  # Output: False
  ```

- **All Uppercase Keys**:
  ```python
  print(check_dict_case({"STATE": "NC", "ZIP": "12345"}))  # Output: True
  ```

## Conclusion

The `check_dict_case` function is a straightforward utility for checking the case consistency of dictionary keys. It is easy to use and integrates seamlessly into any Python project without requiring additional dependencies.
