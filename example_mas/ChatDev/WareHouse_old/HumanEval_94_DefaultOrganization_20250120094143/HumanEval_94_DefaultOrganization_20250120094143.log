We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

    For lst = [0,8,1,2,1,7] the output should be 7
    """
.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To solve the customer's task, we need to implement a function that finds the largest prime number in a list and returns the sum of its digits. We will focus on writing the necessary code in Python without implementing a GUI, as the task explicitly states not to include anything redundant.

Here is the plan:

1. **Function `is_prime(n)`**: This function will check if a number `n` is a prime number.
2. **Function `sum_of_digits(n)`**: This function will calculate the sum of the digits of a number `n`.
3. **Function `skjkasdkd(lst)`**: This function will find the largest prime number in the list `lst` and return the sum of its digits.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

main.py

```python
'''

This module contains the implementation of the function `skjkasdkd` which finds the largest prime number in a list and returns the sum of its digits.

'''

def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is a prime number."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def sum_of_digits(n):
    """Calculate the sum of the digits of a number."""
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

def skjkasdkd(lst):
    """You are given a list of integers.
    You need to find the largest prime value and return the sum of its digits.
    """
    largest_prime = None
    for num in lst:
        if is_prime(num):
            if largest_prime is None or num > largest_prime:
                largest_prime = num
    if largest_prime is not None:
        return sum_of_digits(largest_prime)
    return 0  # If there is no prime number in the list
```

This code defines the necessary functions to solve the task. The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime, the `sum_of_digits` function calculates the sum of the digits of a number, and the `skjkasdkd` function finds the largest prime number in the list and returns the sum of its digits.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses standard Python libraries and functions. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty or can be omitted entirely. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses standard Python libraries and functions. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty or can be omitted entirely. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that no additional packages need to be installed for the project to function. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Prime Number Digit Sum Finder

This software module is designed to find the largest prime number in a given list of integers and return the sum of its digits. It is implemented in Python and does not require any external dependencies.

## Main Functions

### 1. `is_prime(n)`
- **Purpose**: Checks if a given number `n` is a prime number.
- **Input**: An integer `n`.
