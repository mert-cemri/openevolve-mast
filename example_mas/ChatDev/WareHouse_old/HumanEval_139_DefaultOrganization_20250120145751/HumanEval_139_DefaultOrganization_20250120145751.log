To solve the task, we need to implement the `special_factorial` function in Python. The function should compute the Brazilian factorial as described. Since the task specifies not to implement a GUI, we will focus solely on the logic required for the function.

### Core Function

- **Function Name:** `special_factorial`
  - **Purpose:** Calculate the Brazilian factorial of a given integer `n`.
  - **Parameters:** `n` (integer) - the number for which the Brazilian factorial is to be calculated.
  - **Returns:** The Brazilian factorial of `n`.

### Implementation

Let's implement the `special_factorial` function in a single file named `main.py`.

FILENAME

```python
# main.py

'''
The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
where n > 0

For example:
>>> special_factorial(4)
288

The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
factorial of this integer.
'''

def factorial(x):
    """Calculate the factorial of a given number x."""
    if x == 0 or x == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return x * factorial(x - 1)

def special_factorial(n):
    """Calculate the Brazilian factorial of a given number n."""
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= factorial(i)
    return result

# Example usage:
# print(special_factorial(4))  # Output should be 288
```

### Explanation

1. **Factorial Function (`factorial`)**: This helper function computes the factorial of a given number `x` using recursion. It is used to calculate the factorial of each number from 1 to `n`.

2. **Special Factorial Function (`special_factorial`)**: This function calculates the Brazilian factorial by iterating from 1 to `n`, computing the factorial of each number, and multiplying them together to get the final result.

This code will correctly compute the Brazilian factorial for any positive integer `n`.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code only uses Python's built-in functionality to calculate factorials. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed for this project.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
```
This empty file signifies that the project does not require any external Python packages to run. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Special Factorial Calculator

This software provides a function to calculate the Brazilian factorial of a given integer. The Brazilian factorial is defined as the product of the factorials of all integers from 1 to n.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `special_factorial(n)`, which calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given integer `n`. The Brazilian factorial is defined as:

\[ \text{brazilian\_factorial}(n) = n! \times (n-1)! \times (n-2)! \times \ldots \times 1! \]

For example, `special_factorial(4)` will return 288, as calculated by:

\[ 4! \times 3! \times 2! \times 1! = 24 \times 6 \times 2 \times 1 = 288 \]

## Installation

This software is written in Python and does not require any external dependencies. You can run it in any Python environment. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv myenv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows:
       ```bash
       myenv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On macOS and Linux:
       ```bash
       source myenv/bin/activate
       ```

3. **No additional packages are required**: Since there are no dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`, you can proceed to use the software directly.

## Usage

To use the `special_factorial` function, follow these steps:

1. **Open the main.py file**: This file contains the implementation of the `special_factorial` function.

2. **Call the function**: You can call the function with any positive integer as an argument. For example:
   ```python
   print(special_factorial(4))  # Output: 288
   ```

3. **Run the script**: Execute the script to see the result. You can run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the `special_factorial` function:

```python
def special_factorial(n):
    """Calculate the Brazilian factorial of a given number n."""
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= factorial(i)
    return result

# Example usage:
print(special_factorial(4))  # Output should be 288
```

This will calculate the Brazilian factorial of 4 and print the result, which is 288.

## Conclusion

This software provides a simple yet powerful function to calculate the Brazilian factorial of a given integer. It is easy to use and does not require any additional dependencies. Simply call the `special_factorial` function with your desired input to get the result.

1. **Open the main.py file**: This file contains the implementation of the `special_factorial` function.

2. **Call the function**: You can call the function with any positive integer as an argument. For example:
   ```python
   print(special_factorial(4))  # Output: 288
   ```

3. **Run the script**: Execute the script to see the result. You can run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the `special_factorial` function:

```python
def special_factorial(n):
    """Calculate the Brazilian factorial of a given number n."""
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= factorial(i)
    return result

# Example usage:
print(special_factorial(4))  # Output should be 288
```

This will calculate the Brazilian factorial of 4 and print the result, which is 288.

## Conclusion

This software provides a simple yet powerful function to calculate the Brazilian factorial of a given integer. It is easy to use and does not require any additional dependencies. Simply call the `special_factorial` function with your desired input to get the result.
