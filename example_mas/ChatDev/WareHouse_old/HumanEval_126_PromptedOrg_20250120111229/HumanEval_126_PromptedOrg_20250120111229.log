We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To solve the task, we need to implement the `is_sorted` function in Python. This function will check if a list of integers is sorted in ascending order and ensure that no number appears more than twice consecutively. Here's a breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Function Name**: `is_sorted`
2. **Purpose**: To determine if a list of integers is sorted in ascending order and does not contain more than one duplicate of the same number consecutively.
3. **Input**: A list of integers.
4. **Output**: A boolean value (`True` or `False`).

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python

'''

is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]) ➞ True
is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]) ➞ False

'''

def is_sorted(lst):
    # Check if the list is sorted in ascending order
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    
    # Check for more than one duplicate of the same number
    for i in range(len(lst) - 2):
        if lst[i] == lst[i + 1] == lst[i + 2]:
            return False
    
    return True

```

This code defines the `is_sorted` function, which iterates through the list to check if it is sorted in ascending order and if any number appears more than twice consecutively. If either condition is violated, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

The code correctly checks if the list is sorted in ascending order and ensures that no number appears more than twice consecutively. However, there is a logical issue: the code should also ensure that no number appears more than twice in total, not just consecutively. 

To fix this, we need to count the occurrences of each number in the list and ensure none appear more than twice.

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    # Check if the list is sorted in ascending order
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    # Check for more than one duplicate of the same number
    from collections import Counter
    count = Counter(lst)
    for value in count.values():
        if value > 2:
            return False
    return True
```

This revision uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count occurrences of each number and ensures no number appears more than twice.

Comments on Codes:
"The code correctly checks if the list is sorted in ascending order and ensures that no number appears more than twice consecutively. However, there is a logical issue: the code should also ensure that no number appears more than twice in total, not just consecutively. 

To fix this, we need to count the occurrences of each number in the list and ensure none appear more than twice.

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    # Check if the list is sorted in ascending order
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    # Check for more than one duplicate of the same number
    from collections import Counter
    count = Counter(lst)
    for value in count.values():
        if value > 2:
            return False
    return True
```

This revision uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count occurrences of each number and ensures no number appears more than twice."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The code correctly checks if the list is sorted in ascending order and ensures there are no more than one duplicate of the same number. However, the condition for duplicates should be adjusted to allow only one duplicate, not more. The current code incorrectly allows two duplicates. Here's the fix:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    # Check if the list is sorted in ascending order
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    # Check for more than one duplicate of the same number
    from collections import Counter
    count = Counter(lst)
    for value in count.values():
        if value > 2:  # Change this condition to value > 1
            return False
    return True
```

Change the condition `if value > 2` to `if value > 1` to ensure the function returns `False` if there are more than one duplicate of the same number.

 The code correctly checks if the list is sorted in ascending order and ensures there are no more than one duplicate of the same number. However, the condition for duplicates should be adjusted to allow only one duplicate, not more. The current code incorrectly allows two duplicates. Here's the fix:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    # Check if the list is sorted in ascending order
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    # Check for more than one duplicate of the same number
    from collections import Counter
    count = Counter(lst)
    for value in count.values():
        if value > 2:  # Change this condition to value > 1
            return False
    return True
```

Change the condition `if value > 2` to `if value > 1` to ensure the function returns `False` if there are more than one duplicate of the same number.

Comments on Codes:
"The code correctly checks if the list is sorted in ascending order and ensures there are no more than one duplicate of the same number. However, the condition for duplicates should be adjusted to allow only one duplicate, not more. The current code incorrectly allows two duplicates. Here's the fix:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    # Check if the list is sorted in ascending order
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    # Check for more than one duplicate of the same number
    from collections import Counter
    count = Counter(lst)
    for value in count.values():
        if value > 2:  # Change this condition to value > 1
            return False
    return True
```

Change the condition `if value > 2` to `if value > 1` to ensure the function returns `False` if there are more than one duplicate of the same number."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The code incorrectly checks for duplicates. The condition `if value > 1` should be `if value > 2` to correctly identify more than one duplicate of the same number.

To fix this, update the condition in the loop that checks for duplicates:

```python

    # Check if the list is sorted in ascending order
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:

Based on the provided code, the only external library used is `collections`, which is part of Python's standard library and does not need to be included in the `requirements.txt` file. Therefore, no additional packages are required for this project. The `requirements.txt` file can be left empty or not included at all. However, if you wish to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, the only external library used is `collections`, which is part of Python's standard library and does not need to be included in the `requirements.txt` file. Therefore, no additional packages are required for this project. The `requirements.txt` file can be left empty or not included at all. However, if you wish to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required

As the CEO, I confirm that the Programmer's assessment is correct. The provided code only utilizes Python's standard library, specifically the `collections` module, which does not require listing in a `requirements.txt` file. Therefore, the project does not have any external dependencies. 

For completeness and clarity, the `requirements.txt` file can be created with a comment indicating that no external dependencies are required. Here is how it should look:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This ensures that anyone reviewing the project understands that no additional packages need to be installed for the code to function as intended.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

# is_sorted Function User Manual

## Introduction

The `is_sorted` function is a Python utility designed to determine if a list of integers is sorted in ascending order. Additionally, it checks if the list contains more than one duplicate of any number, in which case it returns `False`. This function is useful for validating data sequences where order and uniqueness are important.

## Main Functions

- **Check Ascending Order**: The function verifies if the list is sorted in ascending order.
- **Duplicate Check**: It ensures that no number appears more than twice in the list.

## Installation

### Environment Setup

The `is_sorted` function does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to integrate into any Python environment. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

Since there are no external dependencies, you can directly use the function in your Python scripts. Simply copy the function code into your script or module.

## Usage

### Function Definition

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    '''
    Given a list of numbers, return whether or not they are sorted
    in ascending order. If list has more than 1 duplicate of the same
    number, return False. Assume no negative numbers and only integers.
    '''
    # Check if the list is sorted in ascending order
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    # Check for more than one duplicate of the same number
    from collections import Counter
    count = Counter(lst)
    for value in count.values():
        if value > 2:
            return False
    return True
```

### How to Use

1. **Import the Function**: If you have saved the function in a separate module, import it into your script.

   ```python
   from your_module_name import is_sorted
   ```

2. **Call the Function**: Pass a list of integers to the `is_sorted` function.

   ```python
   result = is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
   print(result)  # Output: True
   ```

3. **Interpret the Result**: The function returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order and does not contain more than one duplicate of any number. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Examples

- **Example 1**: A sorted list with no duplicates.

  ```python
  is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  # Returns: True
  ```

- **Example 2**: A list with numbers not in order.

  ```python
  is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5])  # Returns: False
  ```

- **Example 3**: A list with more than one duplicate of a number.

  ```python
  is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4])  # Returns: False
  ```

## Conclusion

The `is_sorted` function is a simple yet effective tool for checking the order and uniqueness of elements in a list. It can be easily integrated into any Python project without the need for additional libraries or dependencies.
