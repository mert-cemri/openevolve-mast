To address the customer's task, we need to implement the `monotonic` function in Python to determine if a list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. The task specifically asks not to implement a GUI, so we will focus solely on the function implementation in a single file, `main.py`.

### Core Function
- **monotonic(l: list)**: This function will check if the list `l` is either monotonically increasing or decreasing. It will return `True` if the list is monotonic, otherwise `False`.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python

'''

This module contains a function to check if a list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.

'''

def monotonic(l: list) -> bool:
    """Return True if list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.
    
    >>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
    True
    >>> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])
    False
    >>> monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])
    True
    """
    if not l:
        return True
    
    increasing = decreasing = True

    for i in range(1, len(l)):
        if l[i] > l[i - 1]:
            decreasing = False
        if l[i] < l[i - 1]:
            increasing = False

    return increasing or decreasing

```

This code defines the `monotonic` function, which checks if the list is either monotonically increasing or decreasing by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the previous one. If the list is empty, it returns `True` as an empty list can be considered trivially monotonic.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the given code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `monotonic` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. Here is how it would look:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

If you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can simply leave it empty or include a comment indicating that there are no dependencies.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `monotonic` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. Here is how it would look:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
If you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can simply leave it empty or include a comment indicating that there are no dependencies. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I agree with the Programmer's assessment. The provided code for the `monotonic` function does not require any external libraries or dependencies, as it solely relies on Python's built-in capabilities. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file can be left empty or include a comment to indicate that there are no dependencies needed for this project. Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

# Monotonic List Checker

This software provides a simple utility function to check if a list of numbers is monotonically increasing or decreasing. It is implemented in Python and does not require any external dependencies.

## Main Function

### `monotonic(l: list) -> bool`

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.

- **Parameters:**
  - `l` (list): A list of numbers to be checked.

- **Returns:**
  - `bool`: `True` if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, `False` otherwise.

- **Examples:**
  ```python
  >>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
  True
  >>> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])
  False
  >>> monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])
  True
  ```

## Installation

Since this software does not require any external libraries, you only need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   - Change into the directory where the `main.py` file is located:
     ```bash
     cd <repository-directory>
     ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   - You can run the script directly using Python to test the `monotonic` function:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

4. **Using the Function:**
   - You can import the `monotonic` function into your own Python scripts and use it as needed:
     ```python
     from main import monotonic

     result = monotonic([1, 2, 3, 4])
     print(result)  # Output: True
     ```

## Documentation

For further details on how the function works, refer to the docstring provided in the `main.py` file. The function is designed to be straightforward and easy to integrate into larger projects where list monotonicity needs to be checked.
