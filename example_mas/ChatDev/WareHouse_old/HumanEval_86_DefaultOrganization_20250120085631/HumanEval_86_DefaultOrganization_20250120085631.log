Considering the task at hand, which involves writing a function to manipulate a string, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a software tool using Python, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" is indeed the most appropriate product modality for this task, as it involves writing and executing Python code to solve the problem. This aligns well with the nature of the task, which is to develop a software function. Let's proceed with this modality.

You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
    ascending order based on ascii value.
    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:
    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'
    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'
    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'

To complete the task, we need to implement the `anti_shuffle` function in Python. The function will take a string and return an ordered version of it, where each word is sorted based on ASCII values while maintaining the order of words and spaces. As per the task requirements, we will only focus on the necessary code for this function without implementing any GUI.

Here is the implementation of the `anti_shuffle` function in the `main.py` file:

main.py

```python
'''
This module contains the implementation of the anti_shuffle function.

def anti_shuffle(s):
    """
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.

    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:
    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'
    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'
    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
    """
    # Split the input string into words while keeping spaces
    words = s.split(' ')
    
    # Sort each word by its characters' ASCII values
    sorted_words = [''.join(sorted(word)) for word in words]
    
    # Join the sorted words with a space to form the final result
    return ' '.join(sorted_words)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(anti_shuffle('Hi'))  # Output: 'Hi'
    print(anti_shuffle('hello'))  # Output: 'ehllo'
    print(anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!'))  # Output: 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
```

This code defines the `anti_shuffle` function, which processes the input string by splitting it into words, sorting each word's characters, and then joining them back together while preserving the spaces. The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how the function works with different inputs.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Based on the provided code, there are no external libraries or packages being used that would require specification in a `requirements.txt` file. The code relies solely on Python's built-in functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed for this specific project.

However, if you want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can simply create an empty one:

```
# requirements.txt

```

This indicates that no additional packages are required beyond the standard Python library.

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external libraries or packages being used that would require specification in a `requirements.txt` file. The code relies solely on Python's built-in functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed for this specific project.
However, if you want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can simply create an empty one:
```
# requirements.txt
```
This indicates that no additional packages are required beyond the standard Python library. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

```bash
cd <project-directory>
```

Replace `<project-directory>` with the name of the cloned directory.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

The Anti-Shuffle software does not have any external dependencies, so you can skip this step. However, ensure that your Python environment is set up correctly.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of the Anti-Shuffle software is encapsulated in the `anti_shuffle` function. This function takes a string as input and returns a new string where each word's characters are sorted in ascending order based on their ASCII values.

### Function Definition

```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    """
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
    ascending order based on ascii value.
    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.
    """
```

### Example Usage

Here are some examples of how to use the `anti_shuffle` function:

```python
# Example 1
result = anti_shuffle('Hi')
print(result)  # Output: 'Hi'

# Example 2
result = anti_shuffle('hello')
print(result)  # Output: 'ehllo'

# Example 3
result = anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!')
print(result)  # Output: 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
```

## How to Use

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.
