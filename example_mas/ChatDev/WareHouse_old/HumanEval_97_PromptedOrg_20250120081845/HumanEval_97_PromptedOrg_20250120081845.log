Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and fixing a piece of software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a function in Python, which aligns with the development of a software tool or application. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, we need to implement the `multiply` function that takes two integers and returns the product of their unit digits. The unit digit of a number can be obtained using the modulus operation with 10. Let's proceed with the implementation.

### Core Function

- **Function `multiply(a, b)`**: This function will take two integers as input, extract their unit digits, and return the product of these unit digits.

Now, let's write the code for the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to multiply the unit digits of two integers.

'''

def multiply(a, b):
    """
    Complete the function that takes two integers and returns 
    the product of their unit digits.
    Assume the input is always valid.
    
    Examples:
    multiply(148, 412) should return 16.
    multiply(19, 28) should return 72.
    multiply(2020, 1851) should return 0.
    multiply(14, -15) should return 20.
    """
    # Extract the unit digits
    unit_digit_a = abs(a) % 10
    unit_digit_b = abs(b) % 10
    
    # Return the product of the unit digits
    return unit_digit_a * unit_digit_b
```

This code defines the `multiply` function, which extracts the unit digits of the two input integers using the modulus operation and returns their product. The use of `abs()` ensures that the function works correctly even if the numbers are negative, as the unit digit is considered without regard to the sign.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `multiply` only uses basic Python operations and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed for the project to run properly.

# Multiply Unit Digits

This software provides a simple function to multiply the unit digits of two integers. It is designed to be straightforward and efficient, with no external dependencies required.

## Main Function

The main function of this software is:

- `multiply(a, b)`: This function takes two integers as input and returns the product of their unit digits. The unit digit of a number is the last digit of its absolute value. For example, the unit digit of -15 is 5.

### Examples

- `multiply(148, 412)` returns `16`.
- `multiply(19, 28)` returns `72`.
- `multiply(2020, 1851)` returns `0`.
- `multiply(14, -15)` returns `20`.

## Installation

There are no external dependencies required for this project. You only need Python installed on your system to run the code.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the repository**: Download or clone the repository containing the `main.py` file.

3. **Run the code**: You can run the code directly using Python. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing `main.py`, and execute the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

To use the `multiply` function, you can either import it into another Python script or run it directly in a Python environment.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import multiply

result = multiply(148, 412)
print(result)  # Output: 16
```

You can replace `148` and `412` with any other integers to get the product of their unit digits.

## Documentation

For further details on how the function works, refer to the docstring within the `main.py` file. The docstring provides a brief explanation of the function's purpose, input parameters, and expected output.

This software is designed to be simple and efficient, focusing solely on the task of multiplying unit digits without any additional features or complexities.

 # Multiply Unit Digits

This software provides a simple function to multiply the unit digits of two integers. It is designed to be straightforward and efficient, with no external dependencies required.

## Main Function

The main function of this software is:

- `multiply(a, b)`: This function takes two integers as input and returns the product of their unit digits. The unit digit of a number is the last digit of its absolute value. For example, the unit digit of -15 is 5.

### Examples

- `multiply(148, 412)` returns `16`.
- `multiply(19, 28)` returns `72`.
- `multiply(2020, 1851)` returns `0`.
- `multiply(14, -15)` returns `20`.
