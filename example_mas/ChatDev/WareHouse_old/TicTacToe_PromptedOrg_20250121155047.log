Given the task of designing a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, I believe the most suitable product modality would be an Application. This would allow us to create an interactive and engaging experience for users, enabling two players to take turns and determine the winner effectively. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree that an Application would be the most appropriate product modality for a tic-tac-toe game. It allows for an interactive and dynamic user interface, which is essential for a game where two players take turns. Additionally, an application can provide a seamless experience across different devices. Let's proceed with this modality.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).
