To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To solve the task, we need to implement the `get_row` function in Python. This function will search for a given integer `x` in a 2D list and return a list of tuples representing the coordinates of `x` in the list. The coordinates should be sorted by rows in ascending order and by columns in descending order within each row.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Name**: `get_row`
   - **Purpose**: To find all occurrences of an integer `x` in a 2D list and return their coordinates sorted as specified.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - Iterate through each row of the list.
   - For each row, iterate through each element to find occurrences of `x`.
   - Collect the coordinates (row index, column index) of each occurrence.
   - Sort the list of coordinates first by row index in ascending order and then by column index in descending order for each row.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

    get_row([], 1) == []

    """
    coordinates = []
    for row_index, row in enumerate(lst):
        for col_index, value in enumerate(row):
            if value == x:

    # Sort the coordinates: first by row in ascending order, then by column in descending order
    coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))
    
    return coordinates

This code defines the `get_row` function, which performs the required operations to find and sort the coordinates of the integer `x` in the given 2D list. The function is fully implemented and ready to be used as specified in the task description.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# User Manual for `get_row` Function

## Introduction

The `get_row` function is a Python utility designed to locate all occurrences of a specified integer within a 2D list (nested lists). It returns the coordinates of these occurrences, sorted by specific criteria. This function is useful for data analysis tasks where you need to identify and sort specific data points within a matrix-like structure.

## Main Functionality

### `get_row(lst, x)`

- **Purpose**: To find all occurrences of an integer `x` in a 2D list `lst` and return their coordinates.
- **Parameters**:
  - `lst`: A list of lists, where each sublist represents a row in a 2D structure. Rows can have varying lengths.
  - `x`: The integer value to search for within the 2D list.
- **Returns**: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents the coordinates `(row_index, column_index)` of the integer `x` in the 2D list. The coordinates are sorted first by row index in ascending order, and then by column index in descending order within each row.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example 1
result = get_row([
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6],
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
], 1)
print(result)  # Output: [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]

# Example 2
result = get_row([], 1)
print(result)  # Output: []

# Example 3
result = get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3)
print(result)  # Output: [(2, 2)]
```
