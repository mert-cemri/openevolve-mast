To solve the task, we need to implement the `is_prime` function that determines if a given number is prime. The function should return `True` if the number is prime and `False` otherwise. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Let's outline the necessary function:

1. **Function: `is_prime(n)`**
   - **Purpose**: To check if a given number `n` is a prime number.
   - **Logic**:
     - If `n` is less than or equal to 1, return `False` (since 1 and numbers less than 1 are not prime).
     - If `n` is 2, return `True` (2 is the only even prime number).
     - If `n` is even and greater than 2, return `False` (even numbers greater than 2 are not prime).
     - For odd numbers greater than 2, check divisibility from 3 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, return `False`. Otherwise, return `True`.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python

'''

Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.

'''

def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.
    >>> is_prime(6)
    False
    >>> is_prime(101)
    True
    >>> is_prime(11)
    True
    >>> is_prime(13441)
    True
    >>> is_prime(61)
    True
    >>> is_prime(4)
    False
    >>> is_prime(1)
    False
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This code defines the `is_prime` function, which checks whether a given number `n` is prime by following the outlined logic. The function is efficient for checking primality by reducing unnecessary checks and only iterating up to the square root of `n`.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

The Programmer has correctly identified that the `is_prime` function does not require any external libraries or packages. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty. This is because the function relies solely on Python's built-in capabilities, which do not necessitate any additional dependencies.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

This empty file indicates that no additional packages need to be installed for the project to run properly. If there are any future changes or additions to the project that require external packages, the `requirements.txt` file should be updated accordingly.

 <INFO> The Programmer has correctly identified that the `is_prime` function does not require any external libraries or packages. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty. This is because the function relies solely on Python's built-in capabilities, which do not necessitate any additional dependencies.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Prime Number Checker

This software provides a simple function to determine if a given number is prime. It is implemented in Python and can be used to check the primality of numbers efficiently.

## Main Function

The main function provided by this software is `is_prime(n)`. This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if the number is prime and `False` otherwise.

### Function Details

- **Function Name:** `is_prime`
- **Input:** An integer `n`
- **Output:** A boolean value (`True` or `False`)
- **Description:** The function checks if the input number `n` is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.

### Example Usage

```python
>>> is_prime(6)
False
>>> is_prime(101)
True
>>> is_prime(11)
True
>>> is_prime(13441)
True
>>> is_prime(61)
True
>>> is_prime(4)
False
>>> is_prime(1)
False
```

## Installation

To use this software, you need to have Python installed on your system. The function does not require any external dependencies, so no additional packages are needed.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed:** You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Clone or download the repository:** Obtain the `main.py` file containing the `is_prime` function.

3. **Run the function:** You can use the function in your Python scripts or interactively in a Python shell.

## How to Use

1. **Open a Python environment:** You can use an IDE like PyCharm, VSCode, or a simple text editor with a terminal.

2. **Import the function:** If you have saved the `main.py` file in your project, you can import the function using:
   ```python
   from main import is_prime
   ```

3. **Call the function:** Use the `is_prime` function with any integer to check its primality:
   ```python
   result = is_prime(29)
   print(result)  # Output: True
   ```

## Documentation

For further information and examples, you can refer to the docstring provided within the `is_prime` function in the `main.py` file. The docstring includes example usages and expected outputs.
