To complete the task, we need to implement the `mean_absolute_deviation` function in Python. The task specifically requests not to implement a GUI, so we will focus solely on the function implementation. Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Name**: `mean_absolute_deviation`
   - **Purpose**: Calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers.
   
2. **Steps to Implement**:
   - Calculate the mean of the input list.
   - Compute the absolute deviation of each element from the mean.
   - Calculate the average of these absolute deviations to get the MAD.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0
    """
    if not numbers:
        return 0.0

    mean_value = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    deviations = [abs(x - mean_value) for x in numbers]
    mad = sum(deviations) / len(deviations)
    return mad
```

This code defines the `mean_absolute_deviation` function, which calculates the mean of the input list, computes the absolute deviations from the mean, and then averages these deviations to return the Mean Absolute Deviation. The function handles an empty list by returning `0.0`.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `mean_absolute_deviation` only uses standard Python libraries and functions. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed for the project.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```

This software provides a simple function to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. The Mean Absolute Deviation is a measure of variability that represents the average absolute difference between each element in a dataset and the mean of that dataset.

## Main Function

The main function provided by this software is `mean_absolute_deviation`, which takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation as a floating-point number.

### Function Signature

```python
def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
```

### Example Usage

```python
>>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
1.0
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. To use the software, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Obtain the source code by cloning the repository or downloading the source files.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.

3. **Run the Code**: You can run the code directly in a Python environment. Open a Python interpreter and import the function:

    ```python
    from main import mean_absolute_deviation
    ```

4. **Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation**: Use the `mean_absolute_deviation` function by passing a list of numbers:

    ```python
    numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
    mad = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)
    print(f"The Mean Absolute Deviation is: {mad}")
    ```

## Notes

- The function handles empty lists by returning `0.0` as the Mean Absolute Deviation.
- Ensure that the input list contains only numbers (floats or integers) for accurate results.

## Conclusion

This software provides a straightforward and efficient way to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation of a dataset. It is designed to be simple to use and does not require any additional setup or dependencies.
