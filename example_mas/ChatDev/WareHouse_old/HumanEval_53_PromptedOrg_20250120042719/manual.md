# Add Function

This software provides a simple function to add two integers. It is designed to be straightforward and efficient, making it easy to integrate into larger projects or use as a standalone utility.

## Main Function

The primary function provided by this software is:

- `add(x: int, y: int) -> int`: This function takes two integer arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns their sum. It is a simple utility function that can be used in various applications where integer addition is required.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import add

result1 = add(2, 3)
print(result1)  # Output: 5

result2 = add(5, 7)
print(result2)  # Output: 12
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it easy to set up and use. You can simply download the `main.py` file and include it in your project.

### Steps to Install

1. **Download the Code**: Obtain the `main.py` file from the repository or source where it is hosted.
