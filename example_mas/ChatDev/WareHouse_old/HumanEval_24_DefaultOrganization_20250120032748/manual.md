# Largest Divisor Finder

This software provides a simple utility function to find the largest divisor of a given integer `n` that is smaller than `n`. It is implemented in Python and is designed to be straightforward and efficient for basic numerical computations.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this software is encapsulated in the `largest_divisor` function. This function takes a single integer input `n` and returns the largest integer that divides `n` evenly and is smaller than `n`.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import largest_divisor

result = largest_divisor(15)
print(result)  # Output: 5
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   This project does not require any external dependencies beyond the Python standard library. Therefore, no additional installation steps are necessary.

## How to Use

1. **Import the Function**

   Import the `largest_divisor` function from the `main.py` file in your Python script:

   ```python
   from main import largest_divisor
   ```

2. **Call the Function**

   Pass an integer to the `largest_divisor` function to find its largest divisor smaller than itself:

   ```python
   result = largest_divisor(15)
   print(result)  # Output: 5
   ```

3. **Run Your Script**

   Execute your script to see the results:

   ```bash
   python your_script.py
   ```
