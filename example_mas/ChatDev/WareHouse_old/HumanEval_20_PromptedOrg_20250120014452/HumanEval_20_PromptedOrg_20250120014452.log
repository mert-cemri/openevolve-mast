Given the task is to write a piece of software code that solves a specific problem, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application" since it involves implementing a software tool using Python. This aligns with the requirement to write and test a functional code snippet. What are your thoughts on this?

To solve the task, we need to implement the `find_closest_elements` function in Python. This function will take a list of floating-point numbers and return a tuple containing the two numbers that are closest to each other. The returned tuple should have the smaller number first.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Sort the List**: Sorting the list will help us easily find the closest numbers because the closest numbers will be adjacent to each other in a sorted list.

2. **Initialize Variables**: We will initialize variables to keep track of the minimum difference found and the pair of numbers that have this minimum difference.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: We will iterate through the sorted list and calculate the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers. If a smaller difference is found, we update our variables.

4. **Return the Result**: After iterating through the list, we return the pair of numbers with the smallest difference.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

main.py

```python

'''

From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

'''

from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("The list must contain at least two numbers.")
    
    # Sort the list to make it easier to find the closest elements
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Initialize the minimum difference and the closest pair
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (numbers[0], numbers[1])
    
    # Iterate through the sorted list to find the closest pair
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        diff = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i], numbers[i + 1])
    
    return closest_pair

```

This code will correctly find and return the two closest numbers from the list, ensuring they are returned in the order of the smaller number first.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code only uses Python's built-in functions and types. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, indicating that no additional packages need to be installed for the project to run properly.

# Find Closest Elements

This software provides a function to find the two closest numbers in a list of floating-point numbers. It is designed to be simple and efficient, ensuring that users can quickly identify the closest pair of numbers from any given list.

## Main Functionality

The main function of this software is:

- **find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:** This function takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the two numbers that are closest to each other in value. The numbers in the tuple are returned in ascending order.

### Example Usage

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("The list must contain at least two numbers.")
    # Sort the list to make it easier to find the closest elements
    numbers.sort()
    # Initialize the minimum difference and the closest pair
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (numbers[0], numbers[1])
    # Iterate through the sorted list to find the closest pair
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        diff = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i], numbers[i + 1])
    return closest_pair

# Example
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))  # Output: (2.0, 2.2)
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]))  # Output: (2.0, 2.0)
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it easy to use in any Python environment. Simply ensure that you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Clone or download the script**: Save the `main.py` script to your local machine.

3. **Run the script**: You can execute the script using a Python interpreter to test the function with your own list of numbers.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare your list of numbers**: Ensure your list contains at least two floating-point numbers.

2. **Call the function**: Use the `find_closest_elements` function by passing your list as an argument.

3. **Receive the result**: The function will return a tuple with the two closest numbers in ascending order.

 # Find Closest Elements

This software provides a function to find the two closest numbers in a list of floating-point numbers. It is designed to be simple and efficient, ensuring that users can quickly identify the closest pair of numbers from any given list.

## Main Functionality

The main function of this software is:

- **find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:** This function takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the two numbers that are closest to each other in value. The numbers in the tuple are returned in ascending order.

### Example Usage

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("The list must contain at least two numbers.")
    # Sort the list to make it easier to find the closest elements
    numbers.sort()
    # Initialize the minimum difference and the closest pair
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (numbers[0], numbers[1])
    # Iterate through the sorted list to find the closest pair
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        diff = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i], numbers[i + 1])
    return closest_pair

# Example
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))  # Output: (2.0, 2.2)
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]))  # Output: (2.0, 2.0)
```

## Installation
