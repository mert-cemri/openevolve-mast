Task:

            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            
def get_row(lst, x):
    """
    You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists,
    which is similar to matrix, however, unlike matrices,
    each row may contain a different number of columns.
    Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list,
    and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that
    each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0.
    Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order.
    Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.
    
    Examples:
    get_row([
      [1,2,3,4,5,6],
      [1,2,3,4,1,6],
      [1,2,3,4,5,1]
    ], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]
    get_row([], 1) == []
    get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]
