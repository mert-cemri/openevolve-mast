Given the task at hand, which involves writing a piece of software code to solve a specific problem, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a functional piece of software, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, we need to implement the `factorize` function in Python, which returns a list of prime factors for a given integer. The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus solely on the function implementation. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Name**: `factorize`
   - **Purpose**: To compute and return the list of prime factors of a given integer `n`.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - We will iterate over possible factors starting from 2.
   - For each factor, we will divide `n` as long as it is divisible by the factor.
   - We will append each factor to the result list as many times as it divides `n`.
   - We will continue this process until `n` becomes 1.
   - The function will return the list of factors.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
# main.py

'''
This module contains a function to factorize a given integer into its prime factors.
'''

from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors.
    
    >>> factorize(8)
    [2, 2, 2]
    >>> factorize(25)
    [5, 5]
    >>> factorize(70)
    [2, 5, 7]
    """
    factors = []
    divisor = 2
    while n > 1:
        while n % divisor == 0:
            factors.append(divisor)
            n //= divisor
        divisor += 1
    return factors
```

This code defines the `factorize` function, which calculates and returns the list of prime factors of the input integer `n`. The function is implemented in a straightforward manner, iterating over potential divisors and dividing `n` until it is reduced to 1.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required beyond the standard Python library. The function `factorize` only uses basic Python functionality and the `typing` module, which is part of the standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, as there are no additional packages needed.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Prime Factorization Software

This software provides a simple and efficient way to factorize a given integer into its prime factors. It is designed to return a list of prime factors in ascending order, with each factor appearing as many times as it divides the number.

## Main Functionality

The main functionality of this software is encapsulated in the `factorize` function, which takes an integer as input and returns a list of its prime factors.

### Function: `factorize`

- **Input:** An integer `n`.
- **Output:** A list of integers representing the prime factors of `n`.

#### Example Usage

```python
>>> factorize(8)
[2, 2, 2]
>>> factorize(25)
[5, 5]
>>> factorize(70)
[2, 5, 7]
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it easy to set up and use. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - You can clone the repository from your version control system.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.

3. **Run the Script:**
   - You can run the script directly using Python.
   - Example command:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```

## How to Use

1. **Import the Function:**
   - In your Python script or interactive shell, import the `factorize` function from `main.py`.

   ```python
   from main import factorize
   ```

2. **Call the Function:**
   - Pass the integer you want to factorize as an argument to the `factorize` function.

   ```python
   result = factorize(56)
   print(result)  # Output: [2, 2, 2, 7]
   ```

3. **Interpret the Results:**
   - The function will return a list of prime factors. Each factor will appear as many times as it divides the input number.

## Additional Information

- **No External Libraries Required:** This software is built using only Python's standard library, ensuring compatibility and ease of use.
- **Efficient Algorithm:** The algorithm efficiently finds and lists all prime factors of a given integer.
