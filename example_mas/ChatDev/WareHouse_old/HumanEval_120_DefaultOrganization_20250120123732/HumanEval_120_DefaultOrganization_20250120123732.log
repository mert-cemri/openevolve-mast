As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To solve the task, we need to implement the `maximum` function in Python, which will return a sorted list of the maximum `k` numbers from the given array `arr`. The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus solely on implementing the function as specified.

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Name**: `maximum`
   - **Purpose**: To return a sorted list of the maximum `k` numbers from the array `arr`.
   
2. **Parameters**:
   - `arr`: A list of integers.
   - `k`: A positive integer representing the number of maximum elements to return.

3. **Return Value**:
   - A sorted list of the maximum `k` numbers from `arr`.

4. **Approach**:
   - Sort the array in descending order.
   - Select the first `k` elements from the sorted array.
   - Sort these `k` elements in ascending order before returning them.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python
'''
Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list 
of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.

Example 1:

    Input: arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3
    Output: [-4, -3, 5]

Example 2:

    Input: arr = [4, -4, 4], k = 2
    Output: [4, 4]

Example 3:

    Input: arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1
    Output: [2]

Note:
    1. The length of the array will be in the range of [1, 1000].
    2. The elements in the array will be in the range of [-1000, 1000].
    3. 0 <= k <= len(arr)
'''

def maximum(arr, k):
    # Sort the array in descending order
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    # Take the first k elements
    max_k_elements = sorted_arr[:k]
    # Sort these k elements in ascending order
    return sorted(max_k_elements)
```

This code fulfills the requirements by implementing the `maximum` function as described. It sorts the array in descending order to find the largest `k` elements, then sorts those elements in ascending order before returning them. This approach ensures that the function behaves as expected according to the examples and constraints provided.

    return sorted(max_k_elements)
```

This code fulfills the requirements by implementing the `maximum` function as described. It sorts the array in descending order to find the largest `k` elements, then sorts those elements in ascending order before returning them. This approach ensures that the function behaves as expected according to the examples and constraints provided.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

DOCSTRING

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

```

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

As the Programmer correctly pointed out, the code provided in `main.py` does not utilize any external libraries or packages. It solely relies on Python's built-in functions. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would indeed be empty, as there are no additional dependencies needed.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

# Maximum K Elements Finder

This software provides a simple function to find and return the maximum `k` numbers from a given list of integers. The result is returned as a sorted list in ascending order.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `maximum(arr, k)`, which performs the following tasks:

- Takes an array `arr` of integers and a positive integer `k`.
- Returns a sorted list of length `k` containing the maximum `k` numbers from `arr`.

### Example Usage

1. **Example 1:**

   ```python
   arr = [-3, -4, 5]
   k = 3
   result = maximum(arr, k)
   print(result)  # Output: [-4, -3, 5]
   ```

2. **Example 2:**

   ```python
   arr = [4, -4, 4]
   k = 2
   result = maximum(arr, k)
   print(result)  # Output: [4, 4]
   ```

3. **Example 3:**

   ```python
   arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1]
   k = 1
   result = maximum(arr, k)
   print(result)  # Output: [2]
   ```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to use. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   If the code is hosted in a repository, clone it using:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**

   You can directly run the `main.py` file to test the function:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Import the Function:**

   If you want to use the function in your own scripts, import it as follows:

   ```python
   from main import maximum
   ```

2. **Call the Function:**

   Use the `maximum` function by passing the required parameters:

   ```python
   result = maximum(arr, k)
   ```

3. **Output:**

   The function will return a sorted list of the maximum `k` numbers from the input array.

## Documentation

For further details on the function and its usage, refer to the docstring provided within the `main.py` file. The docstring includes examples and notes on input constraints.

   print(result)  # Output: [4, 4]
   ```

3. **Example 3:**

   ```python
   arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1]
   k = 1
   result = maximum(arr, k)
   print(result)  # Output: [2]
   ```
