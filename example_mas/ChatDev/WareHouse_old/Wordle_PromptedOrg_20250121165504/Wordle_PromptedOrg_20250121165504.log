Given the customer's requirement for a wordle game that is playable from the Linux Terminal and does not require a dedicated UX or GUI platform, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application" implemented via Python. This allows us to create a text-based game that can be executed directly in the terminal. What are your thoughts on this choice?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" implemented via Python is indeed the most suitable product modality for creating a text-based wordle game that can be played in the Linux Terminal. This approach aligns well with the customer's requirements and allows for straightforward implementation of the game's logic and user interaction.

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Design a standard wordle game by providing a daily 5-letter English language word. The game should allow a player to take 6 turns to guess the word. Correct guess for each letter is colored by green (correct letter in correct position), grey for invalid letter, or yellow for correct letter in wrong position.

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To implement the Wordle game in Python, we will create a simple command-line application. The application will consist of a single file for simplicity, as the task is straightforward and does not require complex architecture. Here's a breakdown of the core functions and their purposes:

1. **main()**: The main function to run the game loop.
2. **get_daily_word()**: Function to retrieve or generate the daily word.
3. **get_user_guess()**: Function to get a valid guess from the user.
4. **evaluate_guess()**: Function to evaluate the user's guess and provide feedback.
5. **display_feedback()**: Function to display the feedback for each guess.
6. **play_game()**: Function to manage the game flow, including attempts and win/lose conditions.

Now, let's implement the code in a single file named `wordle.py`.

Here is a new customer's task: Design a standard wordle game by providing a daily 5-letter English language word. The game should allow a player to take 6 turns to guess the word. Correct guess for each letter is colored by green (correct letter in correct position), grey for invalid letter, or yellow for correct letter in wrong position. It should be playable from Linux Terminal, and does not require me to access a dedicated UX or GUI platform, i.e. print the results on terminal at each stage and let me play it there by entering inputs. If the player guesses the word within the allowed number of attempts, they win. If not, the solution is revealed..

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Design a standard wordle game by providing a daily 5-letter English language word. The game should allow a player to take 6 turns to guess the word. Correct guess for each letter is colored by green (correct letter in correct position), grey for invalid letter, or yellow for correct letter in wrong position. It should be playable from Linux Terminal, and does not require me to access a dedicated UX or GUI platform, i.e. print the results on terminal at each stage and let me play it there by entering inputs. If the player guesses the word within the allowed number of attempts, they win. If not, the solution is revealed..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Based on the provided code, it appears that there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run. The code uses only standard Python libraries and functions. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can create an empty one as follows:

```
# requirements.txt

# No external dependencies required for this project.
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any third-party packages and can run with a standard Python installation.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, it appears that there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run. The code uses only standard Python libraries and functions. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can create an empty one as follows:
```
# requirements.txt
# No external dependencies required for this project.
```
This indicates that the project does not rely on any third-party packages and can run with a standard Python installation. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

Here is a new customer's task: Design a standard wordle game by providing a daily 5-letter English language word. The game should allow a player to take 6 turns to guess the word. Correct guess for each letter is colored by green (correct letter in correct position), grey for invalid letter, or yellow for correct letter in wrong position. It should be playable from Linux Terminal, and does not require me to access a dedicated UX or GUI platform, i.e. print the results on terminal at each stage and let me play it there by entering inputs. If the player guesses the word within the allowed number of attempts, they win. If not, the solution is revealed..
To complete the task, you will provide strategic guidance and instructions to your team, ensuring that the solution meets the customer's needs and aligns with the company's objectives.]
