# MinSubArraySum

A simple Python application to find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array from a given list of integers.

## Overview

The `minSubArraySum` function is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array within a list of integers. This can be useful in various computational problems where identifying the smallest possible sum of contiguous elements is required.

### Main Function

- **minSubArraySum(nums):** 
  - **Input:** A list of integers `nums`.
  - **Output:** An integer representing the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array.
  - **Example Usage:**
    ```python
    print(minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]))  # Output: 1
    print(minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]))        # Output: -6
    ```

## Installation

This application does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to set up and use. You only need Python installed on your system.

### Steps to Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed:** 
   - You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the repository or download the script:**
   - Clone the repository using Git:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
   - Or download the `main.py` file directly from the source.

3. **Navigate to the directory containing `main.py`:**
   ```bash
   cd <directory-path>
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the script:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.
   - Execute the script using Python:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Modify the input:**
   - You can modify the list of integers in the `main.py` file to test different scenarios. Simply change the input list in the example usage section of the script.

3. **Understand the output:**
   - The script will print the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array for the provided list of integers.

## Additional Information

- **No external libraries are required**, making this script lightweight and easy to integrate into other projects.
- The algorithm efficiently computes the minimum sub-array sum using a linear time complexity approach, ensuring quick results even for larger lists.

Feel free to modify and adapt the script to suit your specific needs or integrate it into larger projects.
