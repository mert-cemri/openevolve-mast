Given the nature of the task, which involves writing a function to count even and odd digits in an integer, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task involves implementing a software tool using Python, which aligns with the "Application" modality. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. The task requires implementing a Python function, which fits well within the "Application" modality as it involves creating a software tool. Let's proceed with that.

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To solve the task, we need to implement the function `even_odd_count` in Python. This function will take an integer as input and return a tuple containing the count of even and odd digits in the number. The function should handle both positive and negative integers.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Function Name**: `even_odd_count`
   - **Purpose**: To count the number of even and odd digits in a given integer.
   
2. **Parameters**:
   - `num`: An integer whose digits will be analyzed.

3. **Return Value**:
   - A tuple `(even_count, odd_count)` where `even_count` is the number of even digits and `odd_count` is the number of odd digits in the integer.

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - Convert the integer to a string to iterate over each digit.
   - Ignore the negative sign if present.
   - Check each digit to determine if it is even or odd.
   - Count the even and odd digits separately.
   - Return the counts as a tuple.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

Given an integer, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively.

Example:
    even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)
    even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)

'''

def even_odd_count(num):
    # Convert the number to a string and ignore the negative sign if present
    num_str = str(abs(num))
    
    # Initialize counters for even and odd digits
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string representation of the number
    for digit in num_str:
        # Convert the character back to an integer
        digit = int(digit)
        
        # Check if the digit is even or odd and update the respective counter
        if digit % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
    
    # Return the counts as a tuple
    return (even_count, odd_count)

# Example usage:
# print(even_odd_count(-12))  # Output: (1, 1)
# print(even_odd_count(123))  # Output: (1, 2)
```

This code should fulfill the requirements of the task by correctly counting the even and odd digits in any given integer.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

# Even Odd Count

This software provides a simple function to count the number of even and odd digits in a given integer. It is designed to be straightforward and efficient, making it easy to integrate into larger applications or use as a standalone utility.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this software is encapsulated in the `even_odd_count` function. This function takes an integer as input and returns a tuple containing the count of even and odd digits in the number.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import even_odd_count

# Example 1
result = even_odd_count(-12)
print(result)  # Output: (1, 1)

# Example 2
result = even_odd_count(123)
print(result)  # Output: (1, 2)
```

## Installation

This software is implemented in Python and does not require any external dependencies beyond the standard Python library. To use the software, ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change into the directory containing the `main.py` file.

   ```bash
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Run the Code**: You can directly run the Python script or import the function into your own scripts.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Import the Function**: Import the `even_odd_count` function from the `main.py` file into your Python script.

   ```python
   from main import even_odd_count
   ```

2. **Call the Function**: Pass an integer to the `even_odd_count` function to get the count of even and odd digits.

   ```python
   result = even_odd_count(4567)
   print(result)  # Output: (2, 2)
   ```

## Documentation

The `even_odd_count` function is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. It handles both positive and negative integers by ignoring the sign and focusing solely on the digits.

- **Input**: An integer (e.g., `-123`, `456`)
