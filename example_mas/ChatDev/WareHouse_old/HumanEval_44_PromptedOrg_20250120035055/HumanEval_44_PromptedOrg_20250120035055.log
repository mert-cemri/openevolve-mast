To solve the task, we need to implement the `change_base` function that converts a given integer `x` to a specified base and returns its string representation. The base is assumed to be less than 10. We will implement this function in a single file named `main.py`.

### Core Function:
- **change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str**: This function will take an integer `x` and a base `base` as input and return the string representation of `x` in the specified base.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to convert a given integer to a specified base and return its string representation.

'''

def change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str:
    """Change numerical base of input number x to base.
    return string representation after the conversion.
    base numbers are less than 10.
    
    Args:
    x (int): The number to be converted.
    base (int): The base to convert the number to.
    
    Returns:
    str: The string representation of the number in the specified base.
    
    Examples:
    >>> change_base(8, 3)
    '22'
    >>> change_base(8, 2)
    '1000'
    >>> change_base(7, 2)
    '111'
    """
    if x == 0:
        return "0"
    
    digits = []
    while x > 0:
        remainder = x % base
        digits.append(str(remainder))
        x = x // base
    
    # Reverse the digits since the conversion process gives us the least significant digit first
    digits.reverse()
    
    return ''.join(digits)
```

This code defines the `change_base` function, which converts a given integer `x` to a specified base `base` and returns the result as a string. The function handles the conversion by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting the remainders, which represent the digits of the number in the new base. The digits are collected in reverse order, so they are reversed before returning the final string.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Change Base User Manual

Welcome to the Change Base software! This tool allows you to convert a given integer to a specified base and return its string representation. This is particularly useful for understanding how numbers are represented in different numeral systems.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this software is encapsulated in the `change_base` function. This function takes two arguments: an integer `x` and a `base` to which you want to convert the number. The function returns a string representation of the number in the specified base.

### Function Signature

```python
def change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str:
```

### Parameters

- `x (int)`: The number to be converted.
- `base (int)`: The base to convert the number to. The base should be less than 10.

### Returns

- `str`: The string representation of the number in the specified base.

### Examples

```python
>>> change_base(8, 3)
'22'
>>> change_base(8, 2)
'1000'
>>> change_base(7, 2)
'111'
```

## Installation

To use the Change Base software, you need to have Python installed on your system. The software does not require any additional dependencies, so you can directly run the code.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or download the repository**: You can clone the repository using Git or download the ZIP file and extract it.

3. **Navigate to the directory**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

## Usage

Once you have the environment set up, you can use the `change_base` function by executing the `main.py` file or by importing the function into your own Python scripts.

### Running the Script

To run the script and see the function in action, open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing `main.py`, and execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Importing the Function

If you wish to use the `change_base` function in your own scripts, you can import it as follows:

```python
from main import change_base

# Example usage
result = change_base(8, 3)
print(result)  # Output: '22'
```

## Documentation
