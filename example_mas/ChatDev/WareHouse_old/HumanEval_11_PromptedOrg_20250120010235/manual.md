# Binary XOR String Function

This software provides a simple function to perform a binary XOR operation on two binary strings. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, with no external dependencies required.

## Main Functionality

The main function of this software is `string_xor`, which takes two binary strings as input and returns their XOR result as a binary string. The XOR operation is performed bit by bit, comparing corresponding bits from each string and returning '1' if they are different and '0' if they are the same.

### Example

```python
>>> string_xor('010', '110')
'100'
```

## Installation

There are no external dependencies required for this software, so installation is straightforward. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Clone or download the repository**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the `string_xor` function.

## How to Use

1. **Import the function**: In your Python script, import the `string_xor` function from the `main.py` file.

2. **Call the function**: Use the `string_xor` function by passing two binary strings as arguments.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import string_xor

result = string_xor('1010', '1100')
print(result)  # Output: '0110'
```

## Documentation

The function is self-contained and does not require any additional setup or configuration. It is designed to be used in any Python environment where you can execute Python scripts.
