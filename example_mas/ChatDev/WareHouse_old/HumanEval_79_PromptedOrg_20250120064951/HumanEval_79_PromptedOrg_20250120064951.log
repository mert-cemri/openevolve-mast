Given the task is to write a function that converts a decimal number to a binary string with specific formatting, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application" since it involves implementing a software tool using Python. This aligns with our previous products that involve coding and software development. What are your thoughts?

I agree that the task involves implementing a software tool using Python, which fits well with the "Application" modality. This allows us to focus on the functionality of the code without any additional interfaces or formats. Let's proceed with this modality.

To complete the task, we need to implement a single function `decimal_to_binary` that converts a decimal number to its binary representation and formats it with 'db' at the beginning and the end. Since the task is straightforward and does not require multiple files or classes, we will implement this function directly in the `main.py` file.

Here's the plan:

1. **Function Name**: `decimal_to_binary`
2. **Purpose**: Convert a decimal number to a binary string with 'db' at the start and end.
3. **Input**: A decimal integer.
4. **Output**: A string in the format "db<binary_representation>db".

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to convert a decimal number to a binary string
with 'db' at the beginning and end.

def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """Convert a decimal number to a binary string with 'db' at the beginning and end.

    # Convert the decimal number to binary and remove the '0b' prefix
    binary_representation = bin(decimal)[2:]
    # Format the result with 'db' at the beginning and end
    return f"db{binary_representation}db"
```

This code will correctly convert a decimal number to its binary representation and format it as specified in the task description.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Decimal to Binary Converter

This software module provides a simple function to convert a decimal number into a binary string, with a specific format that includes 'db' at the beginning and end of the string.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this module is `decimal_to_binary(decimal)`. This function takes an integer in decimal form and returns a string representing its binary form, enclosed with 'db' at both the start and the end.

### Function Details

- **Function Name:** `decimal_to_binary`
- **Input:** An integer (`decimal`) which is the decimal number you want to convert.
- **Output:** A string that represents the binary form of the input number, formatted with 'db' at the beginning and end.

#### Example Usage

```python
result = decimal_to_binary(15)
print(result)  # Output: "db1111db"

result = decimal_to_binary(32)
print(result)  # Output: "db100000db"
```

## Installation

This module does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to use. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install
