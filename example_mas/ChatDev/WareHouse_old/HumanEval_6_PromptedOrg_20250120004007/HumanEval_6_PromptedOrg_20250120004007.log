To solve the task, we need to implement a function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string of multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces and returns a list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Function Definition**: We'll define the function `parse_nested_parens` which takes a single string argument and returns a list of integers.

2. **Split the Input String**: We'll split the input string by spaces to get individual groups of parentheses.

3. **Calculate Nesting Level**: For each group, we'll iterate through the characters and use a counter to track the current level of nesting. We'll also keep track of the maximum level of nesting encountered.

4. **Return the Result**: We'll collect the maximum nesting level for each group and return it as a list.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to parse nested parentheses and determine the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses.

def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:

    For each of the group, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.
    E.g. (()()) has maximum two levels of nesting while ((())) has three.

    >>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
    [2, 3, 1, 3]
    """
    # Split the input string into separate groups of parentheses
    groups = paren_string.split()
    
    # List to store the maximum nesting level for each group
    max_nesting_levels = []
    
    # Iterate over each group of parentheses
    for group in groups:
        current_level = 0
        max_level = 0
        
        # Iterate over each character in the group
        for char in group:
            if char == '(':
                current_level += 1
                # Update the maximum level if the current level is greater
                if current_level > max_level:
                    max_level = current_level
            elif char == ')':
                current_level -= 1
        
        # Append the maximum level for this group to the result list
        max_nesting_levels.append(max_level)
    
    return max_nesting_levels
```

This code defines the `parse_nested_parens` function, which processes the input string to determine the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses. The function splits the input string into groups, calculates the nesting level for each group, and returns a list of these levels.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external libraries or packages being used that would require listing in a `requirements.txt` file. The code only uses the built-in `typing` module, which is part of the Python standard library and does not need to be included in a `requirements.txt` file.
Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no additional dependencies:
```
# No external dependencies required
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

```python
def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
```

### Example Usage

```python
>>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```

In this example, the function returns a list `[2, 3, 1, 3]`, indicating the maximum nesting levels for each group of parentheses in the input string.
