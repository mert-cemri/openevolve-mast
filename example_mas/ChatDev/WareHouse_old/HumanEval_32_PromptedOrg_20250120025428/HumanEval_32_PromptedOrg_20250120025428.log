We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To complete the task, we need to implement the `find_zero` function to find a root of the polynomial defined by the coefficients in the list `xs`. The `poly` function is already implemented correctly to evaluate the polynomial at a given point `x`. We will use a numerical method to find the root, such as the Newton-Raphson method, which is suitable for finding roots of real-valued functions.

Here's the plan:

1. **Function `poly(xs: list, x: float)`:** This function evaluates the polynomial at a given point `x`. It is already implemented correctly.

2. **Function `find_zero(xs: list)`:** This function will implement the Newton-Raphson method to find a root of the polynomial. It will:
   - Start with an initial guess for the root.
   - Iterate using the Newton-Raphson formula until the function value is close to zero.
   - Return the root found.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python

'''

This module contains functions to evaluate a polynomial and find its root using the Newton-Raphson method.

    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def derivative(xs: list, x: float):
    """

    return xs[1] + 2 * xs[2] * x + .... n * xs[n] * x^(n-1)
    """
    return sum([i * coeff * math.pow(x, i - 1) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs) if i > 0])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """ 
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial.

    and the largest non-zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.
    
    >>> round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2) # f(x) = 1 + 2x
    -0.5
    >>> round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3

    max_iterations = 1000
    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        fx = poly(xs, x)
        if abs(fx) < tolerance:
            return x
        dfx = derivative(xs, x)
        if dfx == 0:
            raise ValueError("Derivative is zero. No solution found.")
        x -= fx / dfx
    raise ValueError("Exceeded maximum iterations. No solution found.")
```

This code implements the `find_zero` function using the Newton-Raphson method to find a root of the polynomial. The `derivative` function is used to calculate the derivative of the polynomial, which is necessary for the Newton-Raphson iteration. The function iterates until the polynomial value is close to zero or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Based on the provided code, the only external library used is `math`, which is a standard Python library and does not need to be included in the `requirements.txt` file. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no additional dependencies required.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

# Polynomial Solver

This software provides functionality to evaluate polynomials and find their roots using the Newton-Raphson method. It is designed to handle polynomials with coefficients provided in a list format and can find a single root of the polynomial.

## Main Functions

### 1. `poly(xs: list, x: float) -> float`

This function evaluates a polynomial at a given point `x`. The polynomial is defined by its coefficients provided in the list `xs`, where each element corresponds to the coefficient of the term with the respective power.

- **Parameters:**
  - `xs`: A list of coefficients `[a0, a1, a2, ..., an]` for the polynomial `a0 + a1*x + a2*x^2 + ... + an*x^n`.
  - `x`: The point at which to evaluate the polynomial.

- **Returns:** The value of the polynomial at point `x`.

### 2. `derivative(xs: list, x: float) -> float`

This function evaluates the derivative of the polynomial at a given point `x`.

- **Parameters:**
  - `xs`: A list of coefficients `[a0, a1, a2, ..., an]` for the polynomial.
  - `x`: The point at which to evaluate the derivative.

- **Returns:** The value of the derivative of the polynomial at point `x`.

### 3. `find_zero(xs: list) -> float`

This function finds a root of the polynomial using the Newton-Raphson method. It assumes that the polynomial has an even number of coefficients and that the largest non-zero coefficient guarantees a solution.

- **Parameters:**
  - `xs`: A list of coefficients `[a0, a1, a2, ..., an]` for the polynomial.

- **Returns:** A root of the polynomial.

- **Exceptions:** Raises a `ValueError` if the derivative is zero or if the maximum number of iterations is exceeded without finding a solution.

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies. It uses Python's built-in `math` library.

### Quick Install

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

No additional packages are required, so you can directly run the software using Python.

## Usage

To use this software, you can create a Python script or use an interactive Python shell. Below are examples of how to use the main functions:

```python
import math

# Example usage of poly function
coefficients = [1, 2]  # Represents the polynomial f(x) = 1 + 2x
x_value = 3
result = poly(coefficients, x_value)
print(f"The value of the polynomial at x = {x_value} is {result}")

# Example usage of find_zero function
coefficients = [-6, 11, -6, 1]  # Represents the polynomial (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3)
root = find_zero(coefficients)
print(f"A root of the polynomial is {root}")
```

## Documentation

For further details on the functions and their usage, refer to the function docstrings in the code. The software is designed to be straightforward and easy to integrate into other Python projects.
