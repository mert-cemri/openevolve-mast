To solve the task, we need to implement the function `separate_paren_groups` which will take a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses and return a list of those groups as separate strings. The groups are balanced and not nested within each other. Spaces in the input string should be ignored.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can implement this:

1. **Initialize Variables**: We need a list to store the separate groups and a temporary string to build each group. We'll also need a counter to track the balance of parentheses.

2. **Iterate Over Characters**: Loop through each character in the input string.

3. **Ignore Spaces**: If the character is a space, continue to the next character.

4. **Track Parentheses**:
   - If the character is an opening parenthesis '(', increment the counter and add the character to the temporary string.
   - If the character is a closing parenthesis ')', decrement the counter and add the character to the temporary string.

5. **Check for Balanced Group**: When the counter returns to zero, it indicates that a balanced group has been formed. Add the temporary string to the list of groups and reset the temporary string.

6. **Return the List**: After iterating through the string, return the list of balanced groups.

Now, let's implement this in the `main.py` file:

FILENAME

```python

'''

This module contains the function `separate_paren_groups` which separates groups of nested parentheses from a string.

'''

from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
    separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
    Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
    Ignore any spaces in the input string.
    >>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
    ['()', '(())', '(()())']
    """
    groups = []
    current_group = ""
    balance = 0

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == ' ':
            continue
        current_group += char
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        elif char == ')':
            balance -= 1
        
        if balance == 0 and current_group:
            groups.append(current_group)
            current_group = ""

    return groups

```

This code will correctly separate the groups of parentheses as specified in the task.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
