Given the requirements for a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, it seems that an "Application" would be the most suitable product modality. This would allow us to implement the game with interactive features and visual elements, providing a seamless experience for two players to take turns and determine the winner. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree that an "Application" would be the most appropriate product modality for a tic-tac-toe game. It allows us to create an interactive and engaging user interface, which is essential for a game where two players take turns. Additionally, an application can provide the necessary logic to determine the winner efficiently. Let's proceed with this modality.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of ChatDev. Your primary responsibilities include overseeing all technical aspects of the company. You establish the company's technical vision and lead technological development, ensuring that technology resources align with the company's business needs.
You report to the CEO and collaborate with other executives to integrate technology into the company's strategy.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner..
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface in Python, we'll need to create a few core components. Here's a breakdown of the necessary classes and functions:

1. **Game**: This class will manage the overall game state, including the board, current player, and game status.
   - `__init__`: Initialize the game board and set the starting player.
   - `display_board`: Print the current state of the board.
   - `make_move`: Allow a player to make a move if the chosen cell is empty.
   - `check_winner`: Determine if there's a winner or if the game is a draw.
   - `switch_player`: Change the current player after a move.

2. **Player**: This class will represent a player in the game.
   - `__init__`: Initialize the player with a symbol (X or O).

3. **main**: This function will run the game loop, allowing two players to take turns until the game ends.

Now, let's implement the code in separate files.

### game.py

```python
'''

This module contains the Game class that manages the tic-tac-toe game state, including the board, current player, and game status.

'''

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        '''Initialize the game board and set the starting player.'''
        self.board = [' ' for _ in range(9)]
        self.current_player = 'X'
        self.winner = None

    def display_board(self):
        '''Print the current state of the board.'''
        for row in [self.board[i:i+3] for i in range(0, 9, 3)]:
            print('|'.join(row))
            print('-' * 5)

    def make_move(self, position):
        '''Allow a player to make a move if the chosen cell is empty.'''
        if self.board[position] == ' ':
            self.board[position] = self.current_player

        return False

    def check_winner(self):

            [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8],  # Vertical
            [0, 4, 8], [2, 4, 6]              # Diagonal
        ]
        for condition in win_conditions:
            if self.board[condition[0]] == self.board[condition[1]] == self.board[condition[2]] != ' ':
                return True
        return False

    def switch_player(self):
        '''Change the current player after a move.'''
        self.current_player = 'O' if self.current_player == 'X' else 'X'
```

### player.py

```python
'''

This module contains the Player class that represents a player in the tic-tac-toe game.

'''

class Player:
    def __init__(self, symbol):
        '''Initialize the player with a symbol (X or O).'''
        self.symbol = symbol
```

### main.py

```python
'''

This is the main module that runs the tic-tac-toe game loop, allowing two players to take turns until the game ends.

'''

from game import Game
from player import Player

def main():
    '''Run the game loop.'''
    game = Game()
    players = [Player('X'), Player('O')]

    while not game.winner and ' ' in game.board:
        game.display_board()
        position = int(input(f"Player {game.current_player}, enter your move (0-8): "))
        if not game.make_move(position):
            print("Invalid move. Try again.")

    game.display_board()
    if game.winner:
        print(f"Player {game.winner} wins!")
    else:
        print("It's a draw!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code provides a simple command-line interface for a tic-tac-toe game, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner. The game continues until a player wins or the board is full, resulting in a draw.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The code is mostly well-structured and meets the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with user input handling in `main.py`. The `input()` function does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values or integers outside the range 0-8), which could cause the program to crash.

### Comment:
The code does not handle invalid inputs for the move position, which can lead to a crash if a user enters a non-integer or an integer outside the valid range (0-8).

### Suggestion:
Add input validation to ensure that the user enters a valid integer within the range 0-8. You can use a try-except block to handle non-integer inputs and check the range explicitly.

### Revised Code Snippet:
```python
def main():
    '''Run the game loop.'''
    game = Game()
    players = [Player('X'), Player('O')]
    while not game.winner and ' ' in game.board:
        game.display_board()
        while True:
            try:
                position = int(input(f"Player {game.current_player}, enter your move (0-8): "))
                if position < 0 or position > 8:
                    raise ValueError("Position out of range.")
                if game.make_move(position):
                    break
                else:
                    print("Invalid move. Try again.")
            except ValueError as e:
                print(f"Invalid input: {e}. Please enter a number between 0 and 8.")
    game.display_board()
    if game.winner:
        print(f"Player {game.winner} wins!")
    else:
        print("It's a draw!")
```

This revision ensures that the program handles invalid inputs gracefully, enhancing the user experience and robustness of the application.

"The code is mostly well-structured and meets the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with user input handling in `main.py`. The `input()` function does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values or integers outside the range 0-8), which could cause the program to crash.

### Comment:
The code does not handle invalid inputs for the move position, which can lead to a crash if a user enters a non-integer or an integer outside the valid range (0-8).

### Suggestion:
Add input validation to ensure that the user enters a valid integer within the range 0-8. You can use a try-except block to handle non-integer inputs and check the range explicitly.

### Revised Code Snippet:
```python
def main():
    '''Run the game loop.'''
    game = Game()
    players = [Player('X'), Player('O')]
    while not game.winner and ' ' in game.board:
        game.display_board()
        while True:
            try:
                position = int(input(f"Player {game.current_player}, enter your move (0-8): "))
                if position < 0 or position > 8:
                    raise ValueError("Position out of range.")
                if game.make_move(position):
                    break
                else:
                    print("Invalid move. Try again.")
            except ValueError as e:
                print(f"Invalid input: {e}. Please enter a number between 0 and 8.")
    game.display_board()
    if game.winner:
        print(f"Player {game.winner} wins!")
    else:
        print("It's a draw!")
```

This revision ensures that the program handles invalid inputs gracefully, enhancing the user experience and robustness of the application."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The code generally meets the requirements, but there is a potential issue with user experience and input validation. The game currently uses numeric input (0-8) for board positions, which may not be intuitive for all users. Additionally, there is no user interface beyond the console, which may not be considered "user-friendly" as per the task requirement.

To improve user experience and align with the task requirement for a "user-friendly interface," consider implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like Tkinter or PyQt. This would allow users to click on the board to make moves, which is more intuitive than entering numbers.

Here's a suggestion to start addressing this:

1. **Implement a GUI**: Use Tkinter to create a simple window with buttons representing each cell on the tic-tac-toe board. This will allow players to click on the buttons to make their moves.

2. **Update Input Handling**: Replace the console input with button click events to update the board state.

3. **Enhance User Feedback**: Provide visual feedback for invalid moves and display the winner or draw status in the GUI.

By implementing these changes, the game will be more aligned with the task's requirement for a user-friendly interface.

Comments on Codes:
"The code generally meets the requirements, but there is a potential issue with user experience and input validation. The game currently uses numeric input (0-8) for board positions, which may not be intuitive for all users. Additionally, there is no user interface beyond the console, which may not be considered "user-friendly" as per the task requirement.

To improve user experience and align with the task requirement for a "user-friendly interface," consider implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like Tkinter or PyQt. This would allow users to click on the board to make moves, which is more intuitive than entering numbers.

Here's a suggestion to start addressing this:

1. **Implement a GUI**: Use Tkinter to create a simple window with buttons representing each cell on the tic-tac-toe board. This will allow players to click on the buttons to make their moves.

2. **Update Input Handling**: Replace the console input with button click events to update the board state.

3. **Enhance User Feedback**: Provide visual feedback for invalid moves and display the winner or draw status in the GUI.

By implementing these changes, the game will be more aligned with the task's requirement for a user-friendly interface."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

This would allow users to click on the board to make moves, which is more intuitive than entering numbers.\n\nHere\'s a suggestion to start addressing this:\n\n1. Implement a GUI: Use Tkinter to create a simple window with buttons representing each cell on the tic-tac-toe board. This will allow players to click on the buttons to make their moves.\n\n2. Update Input Handling: Replace the console input with button click events to update the board state.\n\n3. Enhance User Feedback: Provide visual feedback for invalid moves and display the winner or draw status in the GUI.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the game will be more aligned with the task\'s requirement for a user-friendly interface.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The code is generally well-structured and meets most of the requirements. However, there is a logical issue in the `on_button_click` function in `main.py`. The current player's symbol is updated on the button after the move is made, which is incorrect. The button should display the symbol of the player who made the move, not the next player. 

**Comment with the highest priority:**
The `on_button_click` function updates the button text with the current player's symbol after the move is made, which results in displaying the next player's symbol instead of the current player's symbol. This needs to be corrected to ensure the correct player's symbol is displayed on the button.

**Suggestion for revision:**
Modify the `on_button_click` function to update the button text with the symbol of the player who made the move before switching the player.

```python
def on_button_click(position, buttons, game):
    '''Handle button click events to make moves.'''
    if game.make_move(position):
        buttons[position].config(text=game.current_player)
        if game.winner:
            messagebox.showinfo("Game Over", f"Player {game.winner} wins!")
            reset_game(buttons, game)
        elif ' ' not in game.board:
            messagebox.showinfo("Game Over", "It's a draw!")
            reset_game(buttons, game)
        else:
            game.switch_player()  # Move this line here to switch player after updating the button
```

This change ensures that the button displays the correct player's symbol immediately after a move is made.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is generally well-structured and meets most of the requirements. However, there is a logical issue in the `on_button_click` function in `main.py`. The current player's symbol is updated on the button after the move is made, which is incorrect. The button should display the symbol of the player who made the move, not the next player. 

**Comment with the highest priority:**
The `on_button_click` function updates the button text with the current player's symbol after the move is made, which results in displaying the next player's symbol instead of the current player's symbol. This needs to be corrected to ensure the correct player's symbol is displayed on the button.

**Suggestion for revision:**
Modify the `on_button_click` function to update the button text with the symbol of the player who made the move before switching the player.

```python
def on_button_click(position, buttons, game):
    '''Handle button click events to make moves.'''
    if game.make_move(position):
        buttons[position].config(text=game.current_player)
        if game.winner:
            messagebox.showinfo("Game Over", f"Player {game.winner} wins!")
            reset_game(buttons, game)
        elif ' ' not in game.board:
            messagebox.showinfo("Game Over", "It's a draw!")
            reset_game(buttons, game)
        else:
            game.switch_player()  # Move this line here to switch player after updating the button
```

This change ensures that the button displays the correct player's symbol immediately after a move is made."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

The error message you encountered is related to the use of the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python. The specific error is:

```
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error occurs when the Tkinter library is trying to create a window, but it cannot find a display to render the GUI. This is typically an issue when running the code in an environment that does not support GUI operations, such as a headless server or a virtual environment without a graphical display.

Here is a summary of the problem:

1. **Environment Issue**: The error indicates that the environment where the code is being executed does not have access to a graphical display. This is common in environments like remote servers or virtual machines that do not have a GUI.

2. **Tkinter Dependency**: The code relies on Tkinter to create a GUI for the tic-tac-toe game. If the environment does not support GUI operations, Tkinter will not be able to create the necessary windows.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following:

- **Run Locally**: If possible, run the code on a local machine with a graphical display.
- **Use a Virtual Display**: If you need to run the code on a server, consider using a virtual display tool like Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to simulate a display environment.
- **Modify for CLI**: Alternatively, modify the code to run in a command-line interface (CLI) environment instead of using Tkinter, if a GUI is not strictly necessary.

Error Summary of Test Reports:
"The error message you encountered is related to the use of the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python. The specific error is:

```
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error occurs when the Tkinter library is trying to create a window, but it cannot find a display to render the GUI. This is typically an issue when running the code in an environment that does not support GUI operations, such as a headless server or a virtual environment without a graphical display.

Here is a summary of the problem:

1. **Environment Issue**: The error indicates that the environment where the code is being executed does not have access to a graphical display. This is common in environments like remote servers or virtual machines that do not have a GUI.

2. **Tkinter Dependency**: The code relies on Tkinter to create a GUI for the tic-tac-toe game. If the environment does not support GUI operations, Tkinter will not be able to create the necessary windows.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following:

- **Run Locally**: If possible, run the code on a local machine with a graphical display.
- **Use a Virtual Display**: If you need to run the code on a server, consider using a virtual display tool like Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to simulate a display environment.
- **Modify for CLI**: Alternatively, modify the code to run in a command-line interface (CLI) environment instead of using Tkinter, if a GUI is not strictly necessary."
Note that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary. Now, use the format exemplified above and modify the problematic codes based on the error summary. Output the codes that you fixed based on the test reported and corresponding explanations (strictly follow the format defined above, including FILENAME, LANGUAGE, DOCSTRING and CODE; incomplete "TODO" codes are strictly prohibited). If no bugs are reported, please return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The error encountered in the test report is an `EOFError`, which occurs when the `input()` function in Python tries to read input from the user, but it reaches the end of the file (EOF) without receiving any input. This typically happens in environments where standard input is not available, such as automated testing environments or certain IDEs.

Here is a summary of the issue:

1. **Location of the Error**: The error occurs in the `get_player_move()` function within the `main.py` file, specifically at the line where `input()` is called to get the player's move.

2. **Cause of the Error**: The `EOFError` is caused by the `input()` function trying to read from standard input, but no input is available. This is common in environments where user interaction is not possible, such as when running automated tests or scripts without a console.

3. **Potential Solutions**:
   - If this code is being tested in an environment without standard input, consider mocking the `input()` function to simulate user input during testing.
   - Alternatively, if the code is intended to run in such environments, modify the code to accept input through other means, such as command-line arguments or configuration files.

In summary, the `EOFError` is not due to a bug in the logic of the code itself but rather an issue with how the code is being executed in an environment that does not support interactive input.

"
Error Summary of Test Reports:
"The error encountered in the test report is an `EOFError`, which occurs when the `input()` function in Python tries to read input from the user, but it reaches the end of the file (EOF) without receiving any input. This typically happens in environments where standard input is not available, such as automated testing environments or certain IDEs.

Here is a summary of the issue:

1. **Location of the Error**: The error occurs in the `get_player_move()` function within the `main.py` file, specifically at the line where `input()` is called to get the player's move.

2. **Cause of the Error**: The `EOFError` is caused by the `input()` function trying to read from standard input, but no input is available. This is common in environments where user interaction is not possible, such as when running automated tests or scripts without a console.

3. **Potential Solutions**:
   - If this code is being tested in an environment without standard input, consider mocking the `input()` function to simulate user input during testing.
   - Alternatively, if the code is intended to run in such environments, modify the code to accept input through other means, such as command-line arguments or configuration files.

In summary, the `EOFError` is not due to a bug in the logic of the code itself but rather an issue with how the code is being executed in an environment that does not support interactive input."
Note that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary. Now, use the format exemplified above and modify the problematic codes based on the error summary. Output the codes that you fixed based on the test reported and corresponding explanations (strictly follow the format defined above, including FILENAME, LANGUAGE, DOCSTRING and CODE; incomplete "TODO" codes are strictly prohibited). If no bugs are reported, please return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

As the CEO, I appreciate the detailed work done by the Programmer and CTO. The current implementation of the tic-tac-toe game is straightforward and relies solely on Python's built-in capabilities, which means there are no external dependencies at this time. This is a good starting point for the project.

However, to ensure that we are prepared for any future enhancements or changes that might require additional libraries, I recommend including a `requirements.txt` file for completeness. This file can currently state that there are no external dependencies, but it will serve as a placeholder for any future updates.

Here is the suggested content for the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This approach aligns with our mission of maintaining high-quality standards and being prepared for future developments. If there are any further enhancements or if the project scope changes, we can easily update this file to include any necessary libraries.

Let's proceed with this approach and ensure that the project is well-documented and ready for any future expansions. If there are any questions or additional requirements, please feel free to reach out.

 As the CEO, I appreciate the detailed work done by the Programmer and CTO. The current implementation of the tic-tac-toe game is straightforward and relies solely on Python's built-in capabilities, which means there are no external dependencies at this time. This is a good starting point for the project.

However, to ensure that we are prepared for any future enhancements or changes that might require additional libraries, I recommend including a `requirements.txt` file for completeness. This file can currently state that there are no external dependencies, but it will serve as a placeholder for any future updates.

Here is the suggested content for the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This approach aligns with our mission of maintaining high-quality standards and being prepared for future developments. If there are any further enhancements or if the project scope changes, we can easily update this file to include any necessary libraries.

Let's proceed with this approach and ensure that the project is well-documented and ready for any future expansions. If there are any questions or additional requirements, please feel free to reach out.

# Tic-Tac-Toe Game User Manual

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game! This user-friendly application allows two players to take turns playing the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The game is developed in Python and runs in a command-line interface.

## Main Functions

The Tic-Tac-Toe Game provides the following main functions:

- **Game Initialization**: Sets up the game board and determines the starting player.
- **Player Turns**: Allows two players to take turns making moves on the board.
- **Winner Determination**: Checks for a winner or a draw after each move.
- **Board Display**: Shows the current state of the board after each move.
- **Player Switching**: Alternates between players after each valid move.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

To run the Tic-Tac-Toe Game, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the game files to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Game Directory**: Change to the directory where the game files are located.

   ```bash
   cd <directory-name>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The game does not require any external dependencies, so you can skip this step.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the `main.py` file to start the game.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Game Instructions**: Once the game starts, you will see the initial empty board and a welcome message.

3. **Player Moves**: Players take turns entering their moves. When prompted, enter a position number (1-9) corresponding to the desired cell on the board:

   ```
   1 | 2 | 3
   ---------
   4 | 5 | 6
   ---------
   7 | 8 | 9
   ```

4. **Game Progression**: After each move, the board is updated and displayed. The game checks for a winner or a draw.

5. **Winning the Game**: The first player to align three of their symbols (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

6. **Restarting the Game**: To play again, simply run the `main.py` file once more.

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid Input**: If you enter an invalid position or a non-numeric input, the game will prompt you to try again.
- **Position Taken**: If you choose a position that is already occupied, you will be asked to select a different position.

Enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe! If you encounter any issues or have questions, please contact our support team for assistance.

6. **Restarting the Game**: To play again, simply run the `main.py` file once more.

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid Input**: If you enter an invalid position or a non-numeric input, the game will prompt you to try again.
- **Position Taken**: If you choose a position that is already occupied, you will be asked to select a different position.
