To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To complete the task, we need to implement the `correct_bracketing` function in Python. The function should check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the given string. Since the task explicitly states not to implement a GUI interface or anything redundant, we will focus solely on the logic required to solve the problem.

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Name**: `correct_bracketing`
   - **Purpose**: To determine if a string of brackets is correctly balanced.
   
2. **Logic**:
   - Use a counter to track the balance of brackets.
   - Iterate through each character in the string:
     - Increment the counter for an opening bracket '('.
     - Decrement the counter for a closing bracket ')'.
     - If the counter goes negative at any point, return `False` (indicating more closing brackets than opening ones).
   - After the loop, check if the counter is zero. If it is, return `True` (indicating all brackets are balanced), otherwise return `False`.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file:

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to check if a string of brackets is correctly balanced.

'''

def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    brackets is a string of "(" and ")".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("(")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("()")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("(()())")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing(")(()")
    False
    """
    balance = 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        elif char == ')':
            balance -= 1
        if balance < 0:
            return False
    return balance == 0
```

This code defines the `correct_bracketing` function, which checks if the input string of brackets is balanced. It uses a simple counter to ensure that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket and returns the appropriate boolean value based on the balance of brackets.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `correct_bracketing` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, to maintain a standard format, you can include a comment indicating that no dependencies are needed.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

Here is a conversation between two roles: Programmer: ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.

```
"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `correct_bracketing` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, to maintain a standard format, you can include a comment indicating that no dependencies are needed.
Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

# Correct Bracketing

This software module provides a simple utility function to check if a string of brackets is correctly balanced. It is designed to ensure that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.

## Main Function

The main function provided in this module is `correct_bracketing`.

### `correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool`

- **Description**: This function takes a string of brackets as input and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

- **Parameters**: 
  - `brackets` (str): A string consisting of the characters `(` and `)`.

- **Returns**: 
  - `bool`: `True` if the brackets are correctly balanced, `False` otherwise.

- **Examples**:
  ```python
  >>> correct_bracketing("(")
  False
  >>> correct_bracketing("()")
  True
  >>> correct_bracketing("(()())")
  True
  >>> correct_bracketing(")(()")
  False
  ```

## Installation

This project does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to set up and use.

### Quick Install

Since there are no external dependencies, you can directly use the provided `main.py` file in your Python environment.

1. **Clone the repository** or download the `main.py` file to your local machine.

2. **Ensure you have Python installed**. This module is compatible with Python 3.x.

3. **Run the module** using your preferred Python interpreter.

## How to Use

1. **Import the function** in your Python script or interactive session:

   ```python
   from main import correct_bracketing
   ```

2. **Call the function** with a string of brackets to check if they are correctly balanced:

   ```python
   result = correct_bracketing("(()())")
   print(result)  # Output: True
   ```

3. **Test with different inputs** to ensure the function behaves as expected:

   ```python
   print(correct_bracketing("("))      # Output: False
   print(correct_bracketing("()"))     # Output: True
   print(correct_bracketing(")(()"))   # Output: False
   ```

This simple utility can be integrated into larger applications where bracket validation is necessary, such as parsing expressions or validating user input in mathematical or programming contexts.
