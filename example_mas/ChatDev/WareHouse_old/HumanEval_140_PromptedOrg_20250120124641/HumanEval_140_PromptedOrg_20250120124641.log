To solve the task, we need to implement the `fix_spaces` function in Python. The function will replace all spaces in a string with underscores, and if there are more than two consecutive spaces, it will replace them with a hyphen. We will implement this functionality in a single file named `main.py`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Function Name**: `fix_spaces`
   - **Purpose**: To process a given string by replacing spaces with underscores and replacing more than two consecutive spaces with a hyphen.

2. **Logic**:
   - Iterate through the string to identify spaces.
   - Count consecutive spaces.
   - Replace single spaces with underscores.
   - Replace more than two consecutive spaces with a hyphen.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Use a loop to traverse the string.
   - Use a counter to track consecutive spaces.
   - Use a list to build the new string with the required replacements.

Now, let's implement the code in `main.py`.

    """
    result = []
    space_count = 0
    
    for char in text:
        if char == ' ':
            space_count += 1
        else:
            if space_count == 1:
                result.append('_')
            elif space_count > 2:
                result.append('-')
            elif space_count == 2:
                result.extend(['_', '_'])
            
            space_count = 0
            result.append(char)
    
    # Handle trailing spaces
    if space_count == 1:
        result.append('_')
    elif space_count > 2:
        result.append('-')
    elif space_count == 2:

    print(fix_spaces(" Example 2"))  # Output: "_Example_2"
    print(fix_spaces(" Example   3"))  # Output: "_Example-3"
```

This code defines the `fix_spaces` function, which processes the input string according to the specified rules. The function is tested with example cases to ensure it works as expected.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

.
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

Based on the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages used that would require listing in a `requirements.txt` file. The code only uses Python's built-in functionality, so no additional dependencies are needed.

Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should be empty, as follows:

```
```

If you plan to add any external libraries in the future, you would list them in this file with their respective versions.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Fix Spaces Function User Manual

Welcome to the user manual for the `fix_spaces` function. This document will guide you through the main functionalities of the software, how to set up the environment, and how to use the function effectively.

## Introduction

The `fix_spaces` function is a simple yet powerful tool designed to process strings by replacing spaces with underscores and more than two consecutive spaces with a hyphen. This can be particularly useful for formatting text data where consistent spacing is required.

### Main Functionality

- **Replace Single Spaces**: Converts single spaces in the text to underscores (`_`).
- **Replace Consecutive Spaces**: Converts more than two consecutive spaces to a hyphen (`-`).
- **Preserve Text Integrity**: Ensures that the non-space characters in the text remain unchanged.

### Examples

- `fix_spaces("Example")` returns `"Example"`
- `fix_spaces("Example 1")` returns `"Example_1"`
- `fix_spaces(" Example 2")` returns `"_Example_2"`
- `fix_spaces(" Example   3")` returns `"_Example-3"`

## Installation

The `fix_spaces` function is implemented in Python. To use this function, ensure you have Python installed on your system. No additional dependencies are required for this function.

1. **Python Installation**: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or Download the Code**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the `fix_spaces` function.

## Usage

1. **Open the Terminal or Command Prompt**: Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script using Python to see the function in action. You can test the function with different input strings.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Modify the Code**: You can modify the `main.py` file to test the function with different strings by changing the examples in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.

## Documentation

For further details on the implementation, you can refer to the docstring within the `main.py` file. This provides a concise explanation of the function's purpose and usage.
