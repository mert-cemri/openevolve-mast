Considering the customer's requirements for interactivity, immediate feedback, shuffle functionality, and daily puzzle generation, I believe the most suitable modality for this puzzle game would be an Application.

An Application modality allows us to implement interactive gameplay, provide immediate feedback, shuffle functionality, and dynamically generate new puzzles daily, all of which align perfectly with the customer's requirements.

Please share your opinion or confirm if you agree with this modality.

To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Develop a puzzle game where the player must group 16 words into four sets of four, based on hidden categories. The words are presented in a 4x4 grid, and players select four at a time to form a group. Correct groups are removed and revealed with a category and a color-coded difficulty (yellow, green, blue, purple). Incorrect guesses count as mistakes, with a maximum of four allowed. Only one correct solution exists, though words may appear to fit multiple categories. Include shuffle functionality and provide immediate feedback after each guess. A new puzzle is generated daily.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a puzzle game where the player must group 16 words into four sets of four, based on hidden categories. The words are presented in a 4x4 grid, and players select four at a time to form a group. Correct groups are removed and revealed with a category and a color-coded difficulty (yellow, green, blue, purple). Incorrect guesses count as mistakes, with a maximum of four allowed. Only one correct solution exists, though words may appear to fit multiple categories. Include shuffle functionality and provide immediate feedback after each guess. A new puzzle is generated daily..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation does not provide immediate feedback clearly indicating the color-coded difficulty (yellow, green, blue, purple) visually or distinctly after each correct guess, as explicitly required by the user's task. The difficulty is only printed as text, which may not clearly convey the intended color-coded feedback.

Suggestions for Revision:

To address this, implement a clear visual indication of the color-coded difficulty after each correct guess. You can use ANSI escape codes to print colored text in the terminal, making the difficulty levels visually distinct. For example, modify the feedback in `main.py` as follows:

1. Define a color mapping dictionary at the beginning of `main.py`:

```python
COLOR_CODES = {
    'Yellow': '\033[93m',
    'Green': '\033[92m',
    'Blue': '\033[94m',
    'Purple': '\033[95m',
    'ENDC': '\033[0m'
}
```

2. Update the feedback print statement in the main loop to use these color codes:

```python
if correct:
    color = COLOR_CODES.get(difficulty, '')
    endc = COLOR_CODES['ENDC']
    print(f"{color}Correct! Category: {category} (Difficulty: {difficulty}){endc}")
else:
    print("Incorrect guess. Try again.")
```

This revision ensures compliance with the user's requirement for clear, immediate, color-coded feedback after each guess.

"Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation does not provide immediate feedback clearly indicating the color-coded difficulty (yellow, green, blue, purple) visually or distinctly after each correct guess, as explicitly required by the user's task. The difficulty is only printed as text, which may not clearly convey the intended color-coded feedback.

To address this, implement a clear visual indication of the color-coded difficulty after each correct guess. You can use ANSI escape codes to print colored text in the terminal, making the difficulty levels visually distinct. For example, modify the feedback in `main.py` as follows:

1. Define a color mapping dictionary at the beginning of `main.py`:

```python
COLOR_CODES = {
    'Yellow': '\033[93m',
    'Green': '\033[92m',
    'Blue': '\033[94m',
    'Purple': '\033[95m',
    'ENDC': '\033[0m'
}
```

2. Update the feedback print statement in the main loop to use these color codes:

```python
if correct:
    color = COLOR_CODES.get(difficulty, '')
    endc = COLOR_CODES['ENDC']
    print(f"{color}Correct! Category: {category} (Difficulty: {difficulty}){endc}")
else:
    print("Incorrect guess. Try again.")
```

This revision ensures compliance with the user's requirement for clear, immediate, color-coded feedback after each guess."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Code Reviewer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to review and assess source code written by programmers. You ensure code quality by identifying bugs, optimizing performance, and enforcing coding standards. You provide constructive feedback to improve software robustness.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and work closely with programmers.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a puzzle game where the player must group 16 words into four sets of four, based on hidden categories. The words are presented in a 4x4 grid, and players select four at a time to form a group. Correct groups are removed and revealed with a category and a color-coded difficulty (yellow, green, blue, purple). Incorrect guesses count as mistakes, with a maximum of four allowed. Only one correct solution exists, though words may appear to fit multiple categories. Include shuffle functionality and provide immediate feedback after each guess. A new puzzle is generated daily..
To complete the task, you will review the code submitted by programmers, identify issues, and suggest improvements to meet quality standards.]

You can use ANSI escape codes to print colored text in the terminal, making the difficulty levels visually distinct. For example, modify the feedback in main.py as follows:\n\n1. Define a color mapping dictionary at the beginning of main.py:\n\npython\nCOLOR_CODES = {\n    \'Yellow\': \'\\033[93m\',\n    \'Green\': \'\\033[92m\',\n    \'Blue\': \'\\033[94m\',\n    \'Purple\': \'\\033[95m\',\n    \'ENDC\': \'\\033[0m\'\n}\n\n\n2. Update the feedback print statement in the main loop to use these color codes:\n\npython\nif correct:\n    color = COLOR_CODES.get(difficulty, \'\')\n    endc = COLOR_CODES[\'ENDC\']\n    print(f"{color}Correct! Category: {category} (Difficulty: {difficulty}){endc}")\nelse:\n    print("Incorrect guess. Try again.")\n\n\nThis revision ensures compliance with the user\'s requirement for clear, immediate, color-coded feedback after each guess.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation does not provide immediate feedback clearly indicating the color-coded difficulty (yellow, green, blue, purple) visually or distinctly enough as required by the user's task. Although the difficulty is printed as text, the color-coding aspect (which is explicitly mentioned in the user's requirements) is not implemented.

Suggestions on Revision:

To fully meet the user's requirement, implement clear visual color-coding in the terminal output. You can achieve this by using a Python library such as `colorama`. For example:

1. Install colorama:
```bash
pip install colorama
```

2. Modify the `main.py` file to include color-coded feedback:
```python
from colorama import init, Fore, Style
init()

# Inside the main loop, modify the feedback section:
if correct:
    color_map = {
        'Yellow': Fore.YELLOW,
        'Green': Fore.GREEN,
        'Blue': Fore.BLUE,
        'Purple': Fore.MAGENTA
    }
    color = color_map.get(difficulty, Fore.WHITE)
    print(f"{color}Correct! Category: {category} (Difficulty: {difficulty}){Style.RESET_ALL}")
else:
    print(f"{Fore.RED}Incorrect guess. Try again.{Style.RESET_ALL}")
```

This change will clearly fulfill the user's requirement of color-coded difficulty feedback, enhancing user experience and aligning precisely with the task specification.

Comments on Codes:
"Highest Priority Comment:

The current implementation does not provide immediate feedback clearly indicating the color-coded difficulty (yellow, green, blue, purple) visually or distinctly enough as required by the user's task. Although the difficulty is printed as text, the color-coding aspect (which is explicitly mentioned in the user's requirements) is not implemented.

Suggestions on Revision:

To fully meet the user's requirement, implement clear visual color-coding in the terminal output. You can achieve this by using a Python library such as `colorama`. For example:

1. Install colorama:
```bash
pip install colorama
```

2. Modify the `main.py` file to include color-coded feedback:
```python
from colorama import init, Fore, Style
init()

# Inside the main loop, modify the feedback section:
if correct:
    color_map = {
        'Yellow': Fore.YELLOW,
        'Green': Fore.GREEN,
        'Blue': Fore.BLUE,
        'Purple': Fore.MAGENTA
    }
    color = color_map.get(difficulty, Fore.WHITE)
    print(f"{color}Correct! Category: {category} (Difficulty: {difficulty}){Style.RESET_ALL}")
else:
    print(f"{Fore.RED}Incorrect guess. Try again.{Style.RESET_ALL}")
```

This change will clearly fulfill the user's requirement of color-coded difficulty feedback, enhancing user experience and aligning precisely with the task specification."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Code Reviewer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to review and assess source code written by programmers. You ensure code quality by identifying bugs, optimizing performance, and enforcing coding standards. You provide constructive feedback to improve software robustness.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and work closely with programmers.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a puzzle game where the player must group 16 words into four sets of four, based on hidden categories. The words are presented in a 4x4 grid, and players select four at a time to form a group. Correct groups are removed and revealed with a category and a color-coded difficulty (yellow, green, blue, purple). Incorrect guesses count as mistakes, with a maximum of four allowed. Only one correct solution exists, though words may appear to fit multiple categories. Include shuffle functionality and provide immediate feedback after each guess. A new puzzle is generated daily..
To complete the task, you will review the code submitted by programmers, identify issues, and suggest improvements to meet quality standards.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a puzzle game where the player must group 16 words into four sets of four, based on hidden categories. The words are presented in a 4x4 grid, and players select four at a time to form a group. Correct groups are removed and revealed with a category and a color-coded difficulty (yellow, green, blue, purple). Incorrect guesses count as mistakes, with a maximum of four allowed. Only one correct solution exists, though words may appear to fit multiple categories. Include shuffle functionality and provide immediate feedback after each guess. A new puzzle is generated daily..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

Highest Priority Comment:
The current implementation does not handle the scenario where the user selects words that have already been correctly grouped and removed from the puzzle grid. This can lead to a runtime error when attempting to remove words that no longer exist in the list.

Suggestion for Revision:
In the `select_group` method within the `PuzzleGame` class, add a validation step to ensure that all selected words are still present in the puzzle grid before proceeding with the group validation. If any selected word is missing (already grouped), provide immediate feedback to the user.

Revised `select_group` method in puzzle_game.py:

```python
def select_group(self, selected_words):
    # Check if all selected words are still available in the puzzle grid
    if not all(word in self.words for word in selected_words):
        return False, "One or more selected words have already been grouped.", None

    selected_set = set(selected_words)
    for category, data in self.categories.items():
        if selected_set == set(data['words']):
            self.found_groups[category] = data
            for word in selected_words:
                self.words.remove(word)
            return True, category, data['difficulty']
    self.mistakes += 1
    return False, None, None
```

Corresponding adjustment in main.py to handle the new feedback message clearly:

```python
correct, category, difficulty = game.select_group(selected_words)
if correct:
    color = color_map.get(difficulty, Fore.WHITE)
    print(f"{color}Correct! Category: {category} (Difficulty: {difficulty}){Style.RESET_ALL}")
elif category is not None:
    print(f"{Fore.RED}{category}{Style.RESET_ALL}")  # Display the error message returned
else:
    print(f"{Fore.RED}Incorrect guess. Try again.{Style.RESET_ALL}")
```

This revision ensures robust handling of user input and prevents potential runtime errors, improving the overall user experience and software stability.

Comments on Codes:
"Highest Priority Comment:
The current implementation does not handle the scenario where the user selects words that have already been correctly grouped and removed from the puzzle grid. This can lead to a runtime error when attempting to remove words that no longer exist in the list.

Suggestion for Revision:
In the `select_group` method within the `PuzzleGame` class, add a validation step to ensure that all selected words are still present in the puzzle grid before proceeding with the group validation. If any selected word is missing (already grouped), provide immediate feedback to the user.

Revised `select_group` method in puzzle_game.py:

```python
def select_group(self, selected_words):
    # Check if all selected words are still available in the puzzle grid
    if not all(word in self.words for word in selected_words):
        return False, "One or more selected words have already been grouped.", None

    selected_set = set(selected_words)
    for category, data in self.categories.items():
        if selected_set == set(data['words']):
            self.found_groups[category] = data
            for word in selected_words:
                self.words.remove(word)
            return True, category, data['difficulty']
    self.mistakes += 1
    return False, None, None
```

Corresponding adjustment in main.py to handle the new feedback message clearly:

```python
correct, category, difficulty = game.select_group(selected_words)
if correct:
    color = color_map.get(difficulty, Fore.WHITE)
    print(f"{color}Correct! Category: {category} (Difficulty: {difficulty}){Style.RESET_ALL}")
elif category is not None:
    print(f"{Fore.RED}{category}{Style.RESET_ALL}")  # Display the error message returned
else:
    print(f"{Fore.RED}Incorrect guess. Try again.{Style.RESET_ALL}")
```

In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

Apple          Dog            Red            Car            
Banana         Cat            Blue           Bike           
Orange         Rabbit         Green          Bus            
Grape          Hamster        Yellow         Train          

Mistakes: 0/4
Select 4 words separated by commas (or type 'shuffle' to shuffle): Apple, Banana, Orange, Grape
Correct! Category: Fruits (Difficulty: Yellow)

Current Puzzle Grid:
Dog            Red            Car            Cat            
Blue           Bike           Rabbit         Green
