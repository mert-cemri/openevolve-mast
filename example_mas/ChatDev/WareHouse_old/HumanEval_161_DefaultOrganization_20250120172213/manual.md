# Solve Function User Manual

Welcome to the user manual for the `solve` function. This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to use the software, including its main functions, installation instructions, and usage examples.

## Overview

The `solve` function is designed to manipulate strings based on specific rules. It processes a given string `s` and returns a modified version according to the following logic:

1. **Letter Case Reversal**: If the string contains any letters, each letter's case is reversed (lowercase to uppercase and vice versa), while non-letter characters remain unchanged.
2. **String Reversal**: If the string contains no letters, the entire string is reversed.

### Examples

- `solve("1234")` returns `"4321"`
- `solve("ab")` returns `"AB"`
- `solve("#a@C")` returns `"#A@c"`

## Installation

The `solve` function is implemented in Python and does not require any external dependencies. You can run it in any standard Python environment.

### Quick Install

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

To use the `solve` function, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Python File**: Save the provided code in a file named `main.py`.

2. **Run the Code**: Execute the file using a Python interpreter. You can do this by opening a terminal or command prompt, navigating to the directory containing `main.py`, and running the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Function Call**: You can call the `solve` function with any string input to see the result. For example:

   ```python
   print(solve("1234"))  # Output: "4321"
   print(solve("ab"))    # Output: "AB"
   print(solve("#a@C"))  # Output: "#A@c"
   ```
