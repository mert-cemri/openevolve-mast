I agree. An "Application" is the most appropriate modality for this task as it focuses on implementing the necessary code logic. This aligns with the customer's request to write and fix the code without any additional presentation layers.

To address the customer's task, we need to implement a function `even_odd_count` that takes an integer and returns a tuple with the count of even and odd digits. The task specifies not to implement a GUI, so we will focus solely on the function implementation in Python. 

Here's the plan:

1. **Function Name**: `even_odd_count`
   - **Purpose**: To count the number of even and odd digits in a given integer.
   - **Input**: An integer `num`.
   - **Output**: A tuple `(even_count, odd_count)`.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python
'''

Given an integer, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively.

Example:
    even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)
    even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)

'''

def even_odd_count(num):
    # Convert the number to a string and remove the negative sign if present
    num_str = str(abs(num))
    
    # Initialize counters for even and odd digits
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each character in the string representation of the number
    for digit in num_str:
        # Convert the character back to an integer
        digit = int(digit)
        
        # Check if the digit is even or odd and update the respective counter
        if digit % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
    
    # Return the counts as a tuple
    return (even_count, odd_count)
```

This code defines the `even_odd_count` function, which processes the input integer to count the even and odd digits, and returns the result as a tuple. The function handles negative numbers by taking the absolute value before processing.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Here is a conversation between two roles: Programmer: ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.

"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `even_odd_count` uses only built-in Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
```
This empty file signifies that the project does not require any external Python packages to run. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Even Odd Digit Counter

A simple Python application to count the number of even and odd digits in an integer.

## Overview

This application provides a function `even_odd_count` that takes an integer as input and returns a tuple containing the count of even and odd digits in the integer. It handles both positive and negative integers.

### Main Function

- **even_odd_count(num):**
  - **Input:** An integer `num`.
  - **Output:** A tuple `(even_count, odd_count)` where `even_count` is the number of even digits and `odd_count` is the number of odd digits in the integer.
  - **Example Usage:**
    - `even_odd_count(-12)` returns `(1, 1)`
    - `even_odd_count(123)` returns `(1, 2)`

## Installation

This application does not have any external dependencies, so you don't need to install any additional packages. It runs on any standard Python environment.

### Quick Start

1. **Ensure you have Python installed.** You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file.**

3. **Run the application:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing `main.py`.
   - Run the Python script using the command:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```

## Usage

To use the `even_odd_count` function, you can either import it into another Python script or run it directly from the command line.

### Example

```python
from main import even_odd_count

# Example usage
result = even_odd_count(12345)
print(f"Even digits: {result[0]}, Odd digits: {result[1]}")
```

### Command Line

You can also test the function directly in the Python interactive shell:

```bash
$ python
>>> from main import even_odd_count
>>> even_odd_count(6789)
(2, 2)
```
