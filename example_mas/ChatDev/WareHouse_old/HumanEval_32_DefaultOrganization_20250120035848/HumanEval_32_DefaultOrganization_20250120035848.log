To solve the task, we need to fix the existing code and implement the `find_zero` function to find a root of the polynomial. The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus on the core functionality. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Fix the `poly` function**: The current implementation is correct for evaluating a polynomial at a given point `x`.

2. **Implement the `find_zero` function**: This function should find a root of the polynomial using a numerical method. Since the problem guarantees a solution for polynomials with an even number of coefficients, we can use the Newton-Raphson method or another root-finding algorithm.

3. **Ensure the code is functional**: The code should be able to evaluate polynomials and find a root as described in the docstring.

Let's implement the necessary code in `main.py`.

```

This code defines the `poly` function to evaluate a polynomial and the `find_zero` function to find a root using the Newton-Raphson method. The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how to use the `find_zero` function.

[2025-20-01 03:59:04 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 To solve the task, we need to fix the existing code and implement the `find_zero` function to find a root of the polynomial. The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus on the core functionality. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Fix the `poly` function**: The current implementation is correct for evaluating a polynomial at a given point `x`.

2. **Implement the `find_zero` function**: This function should find a root of the polynomial using a numerical method. Since the problem guarantees a solution for polynomials with an even number of coefficients, we can use the Newton-Raphson method or another root-finding algorithm.

3. **Ensure the code is functional**: The code should be able to evaluate polynomials and find a root as described in the docstring.

Let's implement the necessary code in `main.py`.

MAIN.PY

```python
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero finds x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only one zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having an even number of coefficients
    and largest non-zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.
    >>> round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2) # f(x) = 1 + 2x
    -0.5
    >>> round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
    1.0
    """
    # Using the Newton-Raphson method to find a root
    def derivative(xs, x):
        """Calculate the derivative of the polynomial at x."""
        return sum([i * coeff * math.pow(x, i - 1) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs) if i > 0])

    x0 = 0  # Initial guess
    tolerance = 1e-7
    max_iterations = 1000

    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        fx = poly(xs, x0)
        if abs(fx) < tolerance:
            return x0
        dfx = derivative(xs, x0)
        if dfx == 0:
            raise ValueError("Derivative is zero. No solution found.")
        x0 = x0 - fx / dfx

    raise ValueError("Exceeded maximum iterations. No solution found.")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # Should print -0.5
    print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # Should print 1.0
```

This code defines the `poly` function to evaluate a polynomial and the `find_zero` function to find a root using the Newton-Raphson method. The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how to use the `find_zero` function.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Based on the provided code, the only external library used is the standard Python `math` library, which is included with Python and does not need to be specified in a `requirements.txt` file. Therefore, the project does not have any additional dependencies that need to be listed. However, if you want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness or future expansion, it would simply be empty or include a comment indicating no external dependencies are required.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

If you anticipate adding dependencies in the future, you can leave the file empty for now:

```
# requirements.txt
```

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation
