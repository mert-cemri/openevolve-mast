- **Parameters**: 
  - `s` (str): The input string.
- **Returns**: 
  - `int`: The number of vowels in the string.

### Test Cases

The software includes a set of test cases to verify the correctness of the `vowels_count` function. These test cases cover various scenarios, including different cases, presence of 'y' at the end, and strings without vowels.
