Given the task at hand, which involves writing a piece of software code to solve a specific problem, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to focus on implementing the necessary code without any additional interfaces or presentations. What are your thoughts on this?

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `maximum` that takes an array of integers and a positive integer `k`, and returns a sorted list of the maximum `k` numbers from the array. The function should handle edge cases such as when `k` is zero or when `k` equals the length of the array.

Here's the plan:

1. **Function `maximum(arr, k)`**: This function will:
   - Sort the array in descending order.
   - Select the first `k` elements from the sorted array.
   - Sort these `k` elements in ascending order before returning them.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python
'''

Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list 
of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.

Example 1:

    Input: arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3
    Output: [-4, -3, 5]

Example 2:

    Input: arr = [4, -4, 4], k = 2
    Output: [4, 4]

Example 3:

    Input: arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1
    Output: [2]

Note:
    1. The length of the array will be in the range of [1, 1000].
    2. The elements in the array will be in the range of [-1000, 1000].
    3. 0 <= k <= len(arr)

'''

def maximum(arr, k):
    # Sort the array in descending order to get the largest elements first
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    # Take the first k elements and sort them in ascending order
    result = sorted(sorted_arr[:k])
    return result
```

This code will correctly implement the functionality as described in the task. The function first sorts the array in descending order to bring the largest elements to the front, then selects the top `k` elements, and finally sorts these elements in ascending order before returning them.

   - Sort the array in descending order.
   - Select the first `k` elements from the sorted array.
   - Sort these `k` elements in ascending order before returning them.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python
'''

Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list 
of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.

Example 1:

    Input: arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3
    Output: [-4, -3, 5]

Example 2:

    Input: arr = [4, -4, 4], k = 2
    Output: [4, 4]

Example 3:

    Input: arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1
    Output: [2]

Note:
    1. The length of the array will be in the range of [1, 1000].
    2. The elements in the array will be in the range of [-1000, 1000].
    3. 0 <= k <= len(arr)

'''

def maximum(arr, k):
    # Sort the array in descending order to get the largest elements first
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    # Take the first k elements and sort them in ascending order
    result = sorted(sorted_arr[:k])
    return result
```

This code will correctly implement the functionality as described in the task. The function first sorts the array in descending order to bring the largest elements to the front, then selects the top `k` elements, and finally sorts these elements in ascending order before returning them.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required to run the function `maximum`. The function uses only built-in Python capabilities, such as sorting and list slicing, which do not require any additional libraries.

Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no external dependencies to specify. Here is how it would look:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

If you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can simply leave it empty or include a comment indicating that no external packages are needed.

The Programmer's assessment is correct. The function `maximum` in the provided `main.py` file does not require any external libraries or dependencies, as it only utilizes Python's built-in functions for sorting and list slicing. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should be empty or include a comment indicating that no external packages are needed. Here is the appropriate content for the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This ensures that anyone reviewing the project understands that no additional Python packages are necessary for the function to operate correctly. If there are no further questions or tasks, I will consider this matter resolved.

# Maximum Function User Manual

## Introduction

The `maximum` function is a Python utility designed to extract the top `k` maximum numbers from a given list of integers. It sorts these numbers in ascending order and returns them as a list. This function is particularly useful for tasks that require identifying and sorting the largest elements from a dataset.

## Main Functionality

- **Function Name**: `maximum`
- **Purpose**: To return a sorted list of the top `k` maximum numbers from an input list of integers.
- **Input Parameters**:
  - `arr`: A list of integers.
  - `k`: A positive integer representing the number of maximum elements to return.
- **Output**: A list of integers containing the top `k` maximum numbers from `arr`, sorted in ascending order.

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to use. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Python Installation

If you do not have Python installed, you can download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

To use the `maximum` function, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Python Script**: Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and create a new Python file, e.g., `main.py`.

2. **Implement the Function**: Copy the following code into your Python file:

    ```python
    def maximum(arr, k):
        # Sort the array in descending order to get the largest elements first
        sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)
        # Take the first k elements and sort them in ascending order
        result = sorted(sorted_arr[:k])
        return result
    ```

3. **Call the Function**: You can now call the `maximum` function with your desired input. For example:

    ```python
    arr = [-3, -4, 5]
    k = 3
    print(maximum(arr, k))  # Output: [-4, -3, 5]
    ```

4. **Run the Script**: Execute your script using the Python interpreter. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing your script, and run:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Examples

Here are a few examples to demonstrate how the `maximum` function works:

- **Example 1**:
  - **Input**: `arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3`
  - **Output**: `[-4, -3, 5]`

- **Example 2**:
  - **Input**: `arr = [4, -4, 4], k = 2`
  - **Output**: `[4, 4]`

- **Example 3**:
  - **Input**: `arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1`
  - **Output**: `[2]`

## Notes

- The length of the array `arr` will be in the range of [1, 1000].
- The elements in the array will be in the range of [-1000, 1000].
- Ensure that `0 <= k <= len(arr)` to avoid errors.

 # Maximum Function User Manual

## Introduction

The `maximum` function is a Python utility designed to extract the top `k` maximum numbers from a given list of integers. It sorts these numbers in ascending order and returns them as a list. This function is particularly useful for tasks that require identifying and sorting the largest elements from a dataset.

## Main Functionality

- **Function Name**: `maximum`
- **Purpose**: To return a sorted list of the top `k` maximum numbers from an input list of integers.
- **Input Parameters**:
  - `arr`: A list of integers.
  - `k`: A positive integer representing the number of maximum elements to return.
- **Output**: A list of integers containing the top `k` maximum numbers from `arr`, sorted in ascending order.

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to use. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Python Installation

If you do not have Python installed, you can download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

To use the `maximum` function, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Python Script**: Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and create a new Python file, e.g., `main.py`.

2. **Implement the Function**: Copy the following code into your Python file:

    ```python
    def maximum(arr, k):
        # Sort the array in descending order to get the largest elements first
        sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)
        # Take the first k elements and sort them in ascending order
        result = sorted(sorted_arr[:k])
        return result
    ```

3. **Call the Function**: You can now call the `maximum` function with your desired input. For example:

    ```python
    arr = [-3, -4, 5]
    k = 3
    print(maximum(arr, k))  # Output: [-4, -3, 5]
    ```

4. **Run the Script**: Execute your script using the Python interpreter. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing your script, and run:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Examples

Here are a few examples to demonstrate how the `maximum` function works:

- **Example 1**:
  - **Input**: `arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3`
  - **Output**: `[-4, -3, 5]`

- **Example 2**:
  - **Input**: `arr = [4, -4, 4], k = 2`
  - **Output**: `[4, 4]`

- **Example 3**:
  - **Input**: `arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1`
  - **Output**: `[2]`

## Notes

- The length of the array `arr` will be in the range of [1, 1000].
- The elements in the array will be in the range of [-1000, 1000].
- Ensure that `0 <= k <= len(arr)` to avoid errors.
