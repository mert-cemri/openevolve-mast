Given the task at hand, which involves writing a piece of software code to solve a specific problem, I believe the most appropriate product modality would be "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a functional piece of software, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts?

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To complete the task, we need to implement the `string_to_md5` function in Python. The function should take a string as input and return its MD5 hash equivalent. If the input string is empty, the function should return `None`. We will not implement a GUI as per the initial task requirement, despite the later mention of a GUI, because the task explicitly states not to implement anything redundant beyond the necessary code.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Function Definition**: Define the function `string_to_md5`.
2. **Check for Empty String**: If the input string is empty, return `None`.
3. **Compute MD5 Hash**: Use Python's `hashlib` library to compute the MD5 hash of the input string.
4. **Return the Hash**: Return the computed MD5 hash as a hexadecimal string.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
# main.py

'''
This module contains a function to convert a given string into its MD5 hash equivalent.
'''

import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text):
    """
    Given a string 'text', return its md5 hash equivalent string.
    If 'text' is an empty string, return None.

    >>> string_to_md5('Hello world') == '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'
    """
    if text == "":
        return None
    
    # Create an MD5 hash object
    md5_hash = hashlib.md5()
    
    # Update the hash object with the bytes of the text
    md5_hash.update(text.encode('utf-8'))
    
    # Return the hexadecimal digest of the hash
    return md5_hash.hexdigest()
```

This code defines the `string_to_md5` function, checks for an empty string, computes the MD5 hash using the `hashlib` library, and returns the hash as a hexadecimal string.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.
