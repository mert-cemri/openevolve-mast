Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and testing a piece of Python code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to focus on the functionality and correctness of the code without any additional presentation layers. What are your thoughts on this?

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `check_dict_case` that checks if all keys in a dictionary are either all lowercase strings or all uppercase strings. The function should return `False` if the dictionary is empty or if any key is not a string.

Here is the plan:

1. **Function Name**: `check_dict_case`
   - **Purpose**: To determine if all keys in a dictionary are either all lowercase strings or all uppercase strings.
   - **Parameters**: A dictionary.
   - **Returns**: `True` if all keys are either all lowercase or all uppercase strings, `False` otherwise.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

Given a dictionary, return True if all keys are strings in lower 
case or all keys are strings in upper case, else return False.
The function should return False if the given dictionary is empty.
Examples:
check_dict_case({"a":"apple", "b":"banana"}) should return True.
check_dict_case({"a":"apple", "A":"banana", "B":"banana"}) should return False.
check_dict_case({"a":"apple", 8:"banana", "a":"apple"}) should return False.
check_dict_case({"Name":"John", "Age":"36", "City":"Houston"}) should return False.
check_dict_case({"STATE":"NC", "ZIP":"12345" }) should return True.

'''

def check_dict_case(d):
    if not d:
        return False
    
    keys = d.keys()
    
    # Check if all keys are strings
    if not all(isinstance(key, str) for key in keys):
        return False
    
    # Check if all keys are lowercase
    if all(key.islower() for key in keys):
        return True
    
    # Check if all keys are uppercase
    if all(key.isupper() for key in keys):
        return True
    
    return False

# Example usage:
# print(check_dict_case({"a":"apple", "b":"banana"}))  # Should return True

# print(check_dict_case({"Name":"John", "Age":"36", "City":"Houston"}))  # Should return False
# print(check_dict_case({"STATE":"NC", "ZIP":"12345"}))  # Should return True

```

This code defines the `check_dict_case` function, which checks the conditions specified in the task. It first checks if the dictionary is empty, then verifies that all keys are strings, and finally checks if all keys are either lowercase or uppercase.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `check_dict_case` only uses built-in Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. Here is how it would look:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

If you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can create an empty file or include a comment indicating that no external packages are needed.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```

pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `check_dict_case` only uses built-in Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. Here is how it would look:
```

If you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can create an empty file or include a comment indicating that no external packages are needed.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

  - Returns `True` if all keys are strings and either all are in lowercase or all are in uppercase.
  - Returns `False` if the dictionary is empty, contains non-string keys, or if the keys are a mix of lowercase and uppercase.

### Examples

- `check_dict_case({"a":"apple", "b":"banana"})` returns `True`.
- `check_dict_case({"a":"apple", "A":"banana", "B":"banana"})` returns `False`.
- `check_dict_case({"a":"apple", 8:"banana", "a":"apple"})` returns `False`.
- `check_dict_case({"Name":"John", "Age":"36", "City":"Houston"})` returns `False`.
- `check_dict_case({"STATE":"NC", "ZIP":"12345" })` returns `True`.
