            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            
def by_length(arr):
    """
    Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,
    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from
    "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine".

    For example:
      arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]   
            -> sort arr -> [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8] 
            -> reverse arr -> [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]
      return ["Eight", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "Two", "One", "One"]
    
      If the array is empty, return an empty array:
      arr = []
      return []
    
      If the array has any strange number ignore it:
      arr = [1, -1 , 55] 
            -> sort arr -> [-1, 1, 55]
            -> reverse arr -> [55, 1, -1]
      return = ['One']
