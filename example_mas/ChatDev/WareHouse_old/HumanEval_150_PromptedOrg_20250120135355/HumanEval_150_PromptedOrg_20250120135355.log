Given the task at hand, which involves writing a simple Python function to determine if a number is prime and return a corresponding value, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task involves implementing a software tool using Python, which aligns with the Application modality. What are your thoughts on this?

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `x_or_y` that determines if a given number `n` is a prime number. If `n` is prime, the function should return `x`; otherwise, it should return `y`. We will implement this functionality in a single Python file named `main.py`.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Function `x_or_y(n, x, y)`**: This function will check if `n` is a prime number. If it is, it will return `x`; otherwise, it will return `y`.

2. **Helper Function `is_prime(n)`**: This function will determine if a number `n` is prime. It will be used within the `x_or_y` function to make the prime check.

Now, let's implement the code in `main.py`.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function `x_or_y` that returns `x` if `n` is a prime number and `y` otherwise.

'''

def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is a prime number."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    """Return x if n is a prime number, otherwise return y."""
    return x if is_prime(n) else y
```

This code defines the `x_or_y` function, which uses the `is_prime` helper function to determine if `n` is a prime number. If `n` is prime, it returns `x`; otherwise, it returns `y`. The `is_prime` function efficiently checks for primality by eliminating even numbers and using a 6k ± 1 optimization.

1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses Python's built-in functionality to determine if a number is prime and to return a value based on that condition. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any external libraries or packages.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses Python's built-in functionality to determine if a number is prime and to return a value based on that condition. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that the project does not rely on any external libraries or packages. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."
