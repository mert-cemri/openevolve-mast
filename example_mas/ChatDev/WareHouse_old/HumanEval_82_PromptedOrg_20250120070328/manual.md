# Prime Length Checker

This software provides a simple utility to check if the length of a given string is a prime number. It includes a function `prime_length` that determines whether the length of a string is a prime number and returns a boolean value accordingly.

## Main Functions

### `prime_length(string)`

- **Description**: This function takes a string as input and returns `True` if the length of the string is a prime number, and `False` otherwise.
- **Examples**:
  - `prime_length('Hello')` returns `True`
  - `prime_length('abcdcba')` returns `True`
  - `prime_length('kittens')` returns `True`
  - `prime_length('orange')` returns `False`

## Installation

This project does not require any external dependencies, so you can run it with a standard Python environment.

### Quick Install

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file to your local machine.

3. No additional installation steps are required as there are no external dependencies.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

3. Run the Python script using the command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. You can test the function by calling it with different string inputs within the script or by using an interactive Python shell.

## Documentation

The code is self-contained and includes comments explaining the logic behind checking if a number is prime. The `is_prime` function is a helper function used by `prime_length` to determine the primality of the string length.
