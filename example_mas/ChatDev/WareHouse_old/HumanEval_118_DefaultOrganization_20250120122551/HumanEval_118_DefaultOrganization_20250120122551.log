Given the task at hand, which involves writing a piece of software code to solve a specific problem, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a functional piece of software, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts on this?

To solve the task, we need to implement the function `get_closest_vowel` in Python. The function should find the closest vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of the word, excluding vowels at the beginning and end of the word. Since the task specifies not to implement a GUI, we will focus solely on the function implementation.

Let's outline the necessary function:

1. **Function: `get_closest_vowel(word)`**
   - **Purpose**: To find the closest vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of the word.
   - **Parameters**: `word` (a string containing English letters only).
   - **Returns**: A string containing the closest vowel or an empty string if no such vowel exists.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python

'''

You are given a word. Your task is to find the closest vowel that stands between 
two consonants from the right side of the word (case sensitive).

Vowels in the beginning and ending doesn't count. Return empty string if you didn't
find any vowel met the above condition. 

You may assume that the given string contains English letter only.

Example:
get_closest_vowel("yogurt") ==> "u"
get_closest_vowel("FULL") ==> "U"
get_closest_vowel("quick") ==> ""
get_closest_vowel("ab") ==> ""

'''

def get_closest_vowel(word):
    vowels = "AEIOUaeiou"
    length = len(word)
    
    # Start from the second last character and move to the second character
    for i in range(length - 2, 0, -1):
        if word[i] in vowels:
            if word[i - 1] not in vowels and word[i + 1] not in vowels:
                return word[i]
    
    return ""

# Example usage
print(get_closest_vowel("yogurt"))  # Output: "u"
print(get_closest_vowel("FULL"))    # Output: "U"
print(get_closest_vowel("quick"))   # Output: ""
print(get_closest_vowel("ab"))      # Output: ""

```

This implementation checks each character from the second last to the second character in the word to find a vowel that is surrounded by consonants. If such a vowel is found, it is returned; otherwise, an empty string is returned.

    two consonants from the right side of the word (case sensitive).
    
    Vowels in the beginning and ending doesn't count. Return empty string if you didn't
    find any vowel met the above condition. 

    You may assume that the given string contains English letter only.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The function `get_closest_vowel` operates solely with basic Python functionality, which means there are no additional dependencies required for this project. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you wish to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any external Python packages.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The function `get_closest_vowel` operates solely with basic Python functionality, which means there are no additional dependencies required for this project. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you wish to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that the project does not rely on any external Python packages. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

### Examples

- `get_closest_vowel("yogurt")` returns `"u"`
- `get_closest_vowel("FULL")` returns `"U"`
- `get_closest_vowel("quick")` returns `""`
- `get_closest_vowel("ab")` returns `""`

## Installation

### Environment Setup

This function does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to set up and use. You only need Python installed on your system.

        # Start from the second last character and move to the second character
        for i in range(length - 2, 0, -1):
            if word[i] in vowels:
                if word[i - 1] not in vowels and word[i + 1] not in vowels:
                    return word[i]
        return ""
    
    # Example usage
