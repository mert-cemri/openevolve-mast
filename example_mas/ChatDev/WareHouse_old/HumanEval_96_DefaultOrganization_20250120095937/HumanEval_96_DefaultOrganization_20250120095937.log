Given the task at hand, which involves writing a function to solve a coding problem, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a software solution, which aligns with the capabilities of an application to execute and demonstrate the functionality of the code. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To solve the task, we need to implement the `count_up_to` function in Python. The function should return a list of prime numbers less than the given non-negative integer `n`. Since the task explicitly states not to implement a GUI interface and only to write the necessary code, we will focus solely on the function implementation.

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Name**: `count_up_to`
2. **Purpose**: To return a list of prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer `n`.
3. **Core Logic**:
   - Check if a number is prime.
   - Iterate through numbers from 2 to `n-1`.
   - Collect numbers that are prime.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python
'''
This module contains the implementation of the count_up_to function,
which returns a list of prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer n.
'''

def is_prime(num):
    """Check if a number is a prime number."""
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def count_up_to(n):
    """Return a list of prime numbers less than n."""
    return [num for num in range(2, n) if is_prime(num)]

# Example usage:
# print(count_up_to(5))  # Output: [2, 3]
# print(count_up_to(11)) # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7]
# print(count_up_to(0))  # Output: []
# print(count_up_to(20)) # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
# print(count_up_to(1))  # Output: []
# print(count_up_to(18)) # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
```

This code defines the `count_up_to` function, which uses a helper function `is_prime` to determine if a number is prime. The function then constructs a list of prime numbers less than `n` using a list comprehension. This solution is efficient and meets the requirements specified in the task.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code only uses Python's built-in functions and libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, indicating that no additional packages need to be installed for the project to run properly.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Programmer correctly identified, the code provided in `main.py` does not rely on any external libraries or packages. It solely utilizes Python's built-in capabilities to determine prime numbers and generate a list of primes less than a given number. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would indeed be empty, as no additional packages are necessary for the code to function.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
