Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and testing a piece of software code, I believe the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a function in Python, which aligns with creating a software tool or application. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, we need to focus on implementing the function `parse_nested_parens` as described in the task. The task explicitly states not to implement a GUI interface or anything redundant, so we will focus solely on the logic required to solve the problem.

Here's the plan for the function:

1. **Function Name**: `parse_nested_parens`
2. **Purpose**: To determine the deepest level of nesting of parentheses for each group in a given string.
3. **Input**: A string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces.
4. **Output**: A list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group.

### Implementation Steps:

- Split the input string by spaces to get individual groups of parentheses.
- For each group, iterate through the characters to calculate the nesting level:
  - Use a counter to track the current level of nesting.
  - Update the maximum level of nesting encountered.
- Append the maximum level for each group to the result list.
- Return the result list.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file:

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to calculate the deepest level of nesting of parentheses for each group in a given string.

'''

from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """ Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.
    For each of the group, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.
    E.g. (()()) has maximum two levels of nesting while ((())) has three.

    >>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
    [2, 3, 1, 3]
    """
    # Split the input string into individual groups of parentheses
    groups = paren_string.split()
    # Initialize a list to store the maximum nesting level for each group
    max_levels = []

    # Iterate over each group
    for group in groups:
        current_level = 0
        max_level = 0
        # Iterate over each character in the group
        for char in group:
            if char == '(':
                current_level += 1
                # Update the maximum level if the current level is greater
                if current_level > max_level:
                    max_level = current_level
            elif char == ')':
                current_level -= 1
        # Append the maximum level for the current group to the result list
        max_levels.append(max_level)

    return max_levels
```

This code should correctly calculate the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages being used that require installation via a package manager like pip. The code only uses Python's built-in `typing` module, which is included in the standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, as there are no additional dependencies needed for this project.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

# Parse Nested Parentheses

A Python utility to determine the deepest level of nesting for groups of parentheses in a given string.

## Overview

The `parse_nested_parens` function is designed to analyze a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses, separated by spaces. For each group, it calculates and returns the deepest level of nesting.

### Example

For the input string `'(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'`, the function will return `[2, 3, 1, 3]`, indicating the maximum nesting levels for each group.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Python**

   Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

4. **Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

   Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install Dependencies**

   There are no external dependencies required for this project. However, if you plan to extend the functionality, you can manage dependencies using a `requirements.txt` file.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the `parse_nested_parens` function, follow these steps:

1. **Open the `main.py` File**

   The function is implemented in the `main.py` file. You can directly call the function from this file or import it into another Python script.

2. **Call the Function**

   Pass a string of nested parentheses to the function and capture the output:

   ```python
   from main import parse_nested_parens

   result = parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
   print(result)  # Output: [2, 3, 1, 3]
   ```

3. **Run the Script**

   Execute the script to see the results:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
