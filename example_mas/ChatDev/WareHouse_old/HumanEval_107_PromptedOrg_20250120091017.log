As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `even_odd_palindrome(n)` that calculates the number of even and odd integer palindromes within the range from 1 to n, inclusive. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Function Definition**: Define the function `even_odd_palindrome(n)`.

2. **Palindrome Check**: Implement a helper function or logic to check if a number is a palindrome.

3. **Even and Odd Count**: Iterate through numbers from 1 to n, check if each number is a palindrome, and then determine if it is even or odd. Maintain a count of even and odd palindromes.

4. **Return the Result**: Return a tuple containing the count of even palindromes and odd palindromes.

Now, let's implement the code in a single file named `main.py`.
