Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and fixing software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to focus on implementing the necessary code functionality without additional features like visualization or documentation. What are your thoughts on this?

To solve the task, we need to implement the `strange_sort_list` function in Python. This function will take a list of integers and return a new list sorted in a "strange" order, where the smallest element is followed by the largest of the remaining elements, then the next smallest, and so on.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Function Name**: `strange_sort_list`
   - **Purpose**: To sort a list of integers in a specific "strange" order.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize an empty list to store the result.
   - While there are elements in the input list:
     - Find the minimum element, append it to the result, and remove it from the list.
     - If the list is not empty, find the maximum element, append it to the result, and remove it from the list.
   - Return the result list.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''
main.py

This module contains the implementation of the strange_sort_list function,
which sorts a list of integers in a "strange" order: starting with the minimum
value, then the maximum of the remaining integers, then the next minimum, and so on.
'''

def strange_sort_list(lst):
    '''
    Given list of integers, return list in strange order.
    Strange sorting is when you start with the minimum value,
    then maximum of the remaining integers, then minimum and so on.

    Examples:
    strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 4, 2, 3]
    strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5, 5, 5, 5]
    strange_sort_list([]) == []
    '''
    result = []
    while lst:
        min_val = min(lst)
        result.append(min_val)
        lst.remove(min_val)
        if lst:
            max_val = max(lst)
            result.append(max_val)
            lst.remove(max_val)
    return result
```

This code defines the `strange_sort_list` function, which implements the required "strange" sorting algorithm. It iteratively finds and removes the minimum and maximum values from the list, appending them to the result list, until the input list is empty.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING

CODE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

 <INFO> The Programmer has correctly identified that the provided code for the `strange_sort_list` function does not require any external libraries or packages. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, indicating that no additional dependencies are needed for the project to run properly.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
```

This empty file accurately reflects the lack of dependencies for the project. If there are any future changes to the code that introduce new dependencies, the `requirements.txt` file should be updated accordingly.

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Strange Sort List

This software provides a function to sort a list of integers in a "strange" order. The strange sorting starts with the minimum value, then the maximum of the remaining integers, then the next minimum, and so on.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `strange_sort_list(lst)`. This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list sorted in the specified "strange" order.

### Examples

- `strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4])` returns `[1, 4, 2, 3]`
- `strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5])` returns `[5, 5, 5, 5]`
- `strange_sort_list([])` returns `[]`

## Installation

There are no additional dependencies required for this software. It is implemented using standard Python libraries.

### Quick Install

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change into the directory containing the `main.py` file.

   ```bash
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Run the Function**: You can run the function by importing it into a Python script or interactive session.

   ```python
   from main import strange_sort_list

   # Example usage
   result = strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4])
   print(result)  # Output: [1, 4, 2, 3]
   ```

## Documentation

The function is straightforward and does not require additional configuration or setup. The logic is implemented in a single function, `strange_sort_list`, which can be easily integrated into other Python projects.

For any further questions or support, please contact our support team.
