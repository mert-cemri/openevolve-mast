Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and fixing a piece of software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a functional piece of software, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, we need to implement the function `common` that returns sorted unique common elements for two lists. The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus on implementing the function in a single Python file named `main.py`.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Definition**: Define the function `common` that takes two lists as input.
2. **Find Common Elements**: Use set operations to find the intersection of the two lists.
3. **Sort and Return**: Convert the intersection to a sorted list and return it.

Now, let's write the code for `main.py`.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to find sorted unique common elements between two lists.

'''

def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.
    >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
    [1, 5, 653]
    >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
    [2, 3]
    """
    # Convert lists to sets and find the intersection
    common_elements = set(l1) & set(l2)
    # Convert the set to a sorted list
    return sorted(common_elements)

```

This code defines the `common` function, which uses set intersection to find common elements between two lists, and then sorts and returns these elements as a list. The function is designed to meet the requirements specified in the task description.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required since it only uses basic Python data structures and operations. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, to adhere to best practices, you can include a comment indicating that no external packages are needed.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```

# Common Elements Finder

This software module provides a simple utility function to find and return sorted unique common elements between two lists. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, requiring no external dependencies.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this software is encapsulated in the `common` function. This function takes two lists as input and returns a list of sorted unique elements that are common to both input lists.

### Function Signature

```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list) -> list:
```

### Example Usage

```python
