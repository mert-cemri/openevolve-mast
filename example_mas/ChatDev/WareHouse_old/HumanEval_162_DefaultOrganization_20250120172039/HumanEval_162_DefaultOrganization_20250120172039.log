Given the task at hand, which involves writing a function to convert a string to its MD5 hash, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task is primarily focused on implementing a piece of software code, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts?

To complete the task, we need to implement a function that converts a given string to its MD5 hash equivalent. The task specifically asks for a solution without a GUI, so we will focus on implementing the core functionality in Python.

### Core Functionality

1. **Function: `string_to_md5(text)`**
   - **Purpose**: Convert a given string to its MD5 hash equivalent. If the input string is empty, return `None`.
   - **Implementation Details**: Use Python's `hashlib` library to compute the MD5 hash.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

#### main.py

FILENAME

```python
'''
This module contains a function to convert a string to its MD5 hash equivalent.
'''

import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text):
    """
    Given a string 'text', return its md5 hash equivalent string.
    If 'text' is an empty string, return None.

    >>> string_to_md5('Hello world') == '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'
    """
    if not text:
        return None
    # Create an md5 hash object
    md5_hash = hashlib.md5()
    # Update the hash object with the bytes of the text
    md5_hash.update(text.encode('utf-8'))
    # Return the hexadecimal representation of the hash
    return md5_hash.hexdigest()
```

This code defines the `string_to_md5` function, which uses the `hashlib` library to compute the MD5 hash of a given string. If the input string is empty, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation of the MD5 hash. This implementation fulfills the customer's requirements as specified in the task description.

6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Chief Executive Officer, I can confirm that the Programmer's assessment is correct. The `hashlib` library used in the `main.py` file is part of Python's standard library, which means it does not require any additional installation through a package manager like `pip`. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, indicating that there are no external dependencies needed for this project.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

This empty file signifies that the project relies solely on Python's standard library, and no additional packages are necessary for it to run properly. If there are any further questions or if additional features are needed, please feel free to reach out.

# String to MD5 Converter

This software module provides a simple function to convert a given string into its MD5 hash equivalent. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, focusing solely on the task of generating MD5 hashes from input strings.

## Main Functionality

The primary function provided by this module is `string_to_md5(text)`. This function takes a string input and returns its MD5 hash equivalent as a hexadecimal string. If the input string is empty, the function returns `None`.

### Function Signature

```python
def string_to_md5(text):
    """
    Given a string 'text', return its md5 hash equivalent string.
    If 'text' is an empty string, return None.
    >>> string_to_md5('Hello world') == '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'
    """
```

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage of the string_to_md5 function
result = string_to_md5('Hello world')
print(result)  # Output: '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'
```

## Installation

To use this module, you need to have Python installed on your system. The module relies on the `hashlib` library, which is included in the Python Standard Library, so no additional installations are required.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or download the module**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the `string_to_md5` function.

3. **Run the function**: You can execute the function in any Python environment by importing the `main.py` file and calling `string_to_md5` with your desired input.

## How to Use

1. **Import the function**: Ensure that the `main.py` file is in your working directory or in your Python path.

2. **Call the function**: Use the `string_to_md5` function by passing a string argument to it. The function will return the MD5 hash of the string.

3. **Handle empty strings**: If you pass an empty string to the function, it will return `None`.

## Documentation

For further information and documentation, please refer to the comments within the code. The function is straightforward and includes a docstring that explains its purpose and usage.

This module is designed to be simple and efficient, focusing on the core functionality of converting strings to MD5 hashes without any additional features or dependencies.
