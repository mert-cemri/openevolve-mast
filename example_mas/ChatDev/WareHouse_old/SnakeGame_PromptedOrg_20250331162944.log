To design the classic Snake game in Python, we'll need to create a few core classes and functions. Here's a breakdown of the necessary components:

1. **Game**: This class will manage the game loop, handle user input, and update the game state.
   - `run()`: Starts the game loop.
   - `handle_input()`: Processes user input to control the snake.
   - `update()`: Updates the game state, including moving the snake and checking for collisions.
   - `render()`: Renders the game board and score.

2. **Snake**: This class will represent the snake, including its position and movement.
   - `move()`: Moves the snake in the current direction.
   - `grow()`: Increases the length of the snake.
   - `check_collision()`: Checks if the snake has collided with itself or the boundaries.

3. **Food**: This class will represent the food items on the board.
   - `spawn()`: Places food at a random position on the board.

4. **Board**: This class will represent the game board.
   - `draw()`: Draws the board, snake, and food.

5. **Score**: This class will manage the player's score.
   - `update()`: Updates the score when the snake eats food.
   - `display()`: Displays the current score.

Now, let's implement the code for each of these components.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Design a classic Snake game. The player controls a snake using directional inputs to move around the board and eat 'food' items. Each time the snake eats, it grows in length. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundary. The board updates after each move. Show the current score based on food eaten, and consider offering multiple difficulty levels..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The code has a critical issue regarding the snake's collision detection with the board boundaries. Currently, the `check_collision` method in the `Snake` class only checks if the snake's head is within the snake's body or if the head's coordinates are negative. It does not check if the snake's head has exceeded the board's width or height, which is necessary to end the game when the snake hits the boundary.

To fix this, modify the `check_collision` method in the `Snake` class to include boundary checks:

```python
def check_collision(self):
    head = self.body[0]
    # Check if the head is within the snake's body
    if head in list(self.body)[1:]:
        return True
    # Check if the head is out of the board boundaries
    if head[0] < 0 or head[0] >= self.board_width or head[1] < 0 or head[1] >= self.board_height:
        return True
    return False
```

This change ensures that the game ends when the snake collides with the boundaries of the board, fulfilling the user's requirement.

Comments on Codes:
"The code has a critical issue regarding the snake's collision detection with the board boundaries. Currently, the `check_collision` method in the `Snake` class only checks if the snake's head is within the snake's body or if the head's coordinates are negative. It does not check if the snake's head has exceeded the board's width or height, which is necessary to end the game when the snake hits the boundary.

To fix this, modify the `check_collision` method in the `Snake` class to include boundary checks:

```python
def check_collision(self):
    head = self.body[0]
    # Check if the head is within the snake's body
    if head in list(self.body)[1:]:
        return True
    # Check if the head is out of the board boundaries
    if head[0] < 0 or head[0] >= self.board_width or head[1] < 0 or head[1] >= self.board_height:
        return True
    return False
```

This change ensures that the game ends when the snake collides with the boundaries of the board, fulfilling the user's requirement."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Code Reviewer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to review and assess source code written by programmers. You ensure code quality by identifying bugs, optimizing performance, and enforcing coding standards. You provide constructive feedback to improve software robustness.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and work closely with programmers.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a classic Snake game. The player controls a snake using directional inputs to move around the board and eat 'food' items. Each time the snake eats, it grows in length. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundary. The board updates after each move. Show the current score based on food eaten, and consider offering multiple difficulty levels..
To complete the task, you will review the code submitted by programmers, identify issues, and suggest improvements to meet quality standards.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a classic Snake game. The player controls a snake using directional inputs to move around the board and eat 'food' items. Each time the snake eats, it grows in length. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundary. The board updates after each move. Show the current score based on food eaten, and consider offering multiple difficulty levels..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the task requirements. However, there is a significant issue with the `change_direction` method in the `Snake` class. The current implementation allows the snake to reverse direction immediately, which is not typical behavior in classic Snake games and can lead to an immediate collision with itself.

### Comment with Highest Priority:
**Issue:** The `change_direction` method allows the snake to reverse direction immediately, which can cause the snake to collide with itself and end the game prematurely.

### Suggestion for Revision:
Modify the `change_direction` method to prevent the snake from reversing direction directly. Ensure that the snake can only change direction to perpendicular directions relative to its current movement.

```python
def change_direction(self, key):
    # Prevent the snake from reversing direction
    opposite_directions = {
        pygame.K_UP: pygame.K_DOWN,
        pygame.K_DOWN: pygame.K_UP,
        pygame.K_LEFT: pygame.K_RIGHT,
        pygame.K_RIGHT: pygame.K_LEFT
    }
    if key in [pygame.K_UP, pygame.K_DOWN, pygame.K_LEFT, pygame.K_RIGHT] and key != opposite_directions[self.direction]:
        self.direction = key
```

This change will ensure that the snake's movement is more consistent with classic Snake game mechanics, enhancing the user experience by preventing unintended game-ending collisions.

Here is a new customer's task: Design a classic Snake game. The player controls a snake using directional inputs to move around the board and eat 'food' items. Each time the snake eats, it grows in length. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundary. The board updates after each move. Show the current score based on food eaten, and consider offering multiple difficulty levels..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

According to the new user's task, our designed product modality, languages and ideas, our developed first-edition source codes are listed below:

Comments on Codes:
"The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the task requirements. However, there is a significant issue with the `change_direction` method in the `Snake` class. The current implementation allows the snake to reverse direction immediately, which is not typical behavior in classic Snake games and can lead to an immediate collision with itself.

### Comment with Highest Priority:
**Issue:** The `change_direction` method allows the snake to reverse direction immediately, which can cause the snake to collide with itself and end the game prematurely.

### Suggestion for Revision:
Modify the `change_direction` method to prevent the snake from reversing direction directly. Ensure that the snake can only change direction to perpendicular directions relative to its current movement.

```python
def change_direction(self, key):
    # Prevent the snake from reversing direction
    opposite_directions = {
        pygame.K_UP: pygame.K_DOWN,
        pygame.K_DOWN: pygame.K_UP,
        pygame.K_LEFT: pygame.K_RIGHT,
        pygame.K_RIGHT: pygame.K_LEFT
    }
    if key in [pygame.K_UP, pygame.K_DOWN, pygame.K_LEFT, pygame.K_RIGHT] and key != opposite_directions[self.direction]:
        self.direction = key
```

This change will ensure that the snake's movement is more consistent with classic Snake game mechanics, enhancing the user experience by preventing unintended game-ending collisions."

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a classic Snake game. The player controls a snake using directional inputs to move around the board and eat 'food' items. Each time the snake eats, it grows in length. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundary. The board updates after each move. Show the current score based on food eaten, and consider offering multiple difficulty levels..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the task requirements. However, there is a missing feature regarding the "multiple difficulty levels" requirement. The game currently runs at a fixed speed, controlled by `self.clock.tick(10)`. To implement multiple difficulty levels, you should allow the player to select a difficulty level at the start of the game, which will adjust the game's speed accordingly.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Add a Difficulty Selection Feature:**
   - Modify the `Game` class to include a method for selecting difficulty at the start of the game. This can be done by prompting the user to choose a difficulty level, which will set the speed of the game loop.

2. **Adjust Game Speed Based on Difficulty:**
   - Use different tick rates for different difficulty levels. For example, use a lower tick rate for higher difficulty levels to make the game run faster.

### Example Implementation:
```python
class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        pygame.init()
        self.board = Board()
        self.snake = Snake(self.board.width, self.board.height)
        self.food = Food(self.board.width, self.board.height)
        self.score = Score()
        self.clock = pygame.time.Clock()
        self.running = True
        self.difficulty = self.select_difficulty()

    def select_difficulty(self):
        print("Select Difficulty Level: 1. Easy 2. Medium 3. Hard")
        choice = input("Enter 1, 2, or 3: ")
        if choice == '1':
            return 5  # Easy
        elif choice == '2':
            return 10  # Medium
        elif choice == '3':
            return 15  # Hard
        else:
            print("Invalid choice, defaulting to Medium.")
            return 10  # Default to Medium

    def run(self):
        while self.running:
            self.handle_input()
            self.update()
            self.render()
            self.clock.tick(self.difficulty)  # Use the selected difficulty level
```

This implementation allows the user to select a difficulty level, which adjusts the game's speed, thereby meeting the requirement for multiple difficulty levels.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the task requirements. However, there is a missing feature regarding the "multiple difficulty levels" requirement. The game currently runs at a fixed speed, controlled by `self.clock.tick(10)`. To implement multiple difficulty levels, you should allow the player to select a difficulty level at the start of the game, which will adjust the game's speed accordingly.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Add a Difficulty Selection Feature:**
   - Modify the `Game` class to include a method for selecting difficulty at the start of the game. This can be done by prompting the user to choose a difficulty level, which will set the speed of the game loop.

2. **Adjust Game Speed Based on Difficulty:**
   - Use different tick rates for different difficulty levels. For example, use a lower tick rate for higher difficulty levels to make the game run faster.

### Example Implementation:
```python
class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        pygame.init()
        self.board = Board()
        self.snake = Snake(self.board.width, self.board.height)
        self.food = Food(self.board.width, self.board.height)
        self.score = Score()
        self.clock = pygame.time.Clock()
        self.running = True
        self.difficulty = self.select_difficulty()

    def select_difficulty(self):
        print("Select Difficulty Level: 1. Easy 2. Medium 3. Hard")
        choice = input("Enter 1, 2, or 3: ")
        if choice == '1':
            return 5  # Easy
        elif choice == '2':
            return 10  # Medium
        elif choice == '3':
            return 15  # Hard
        else:
            print("Invalid choice, defaulting to Medium.")
            return 10  # Default to Medium

    def run(self):
        while self.running:
            self.handle_input()
            self.update()
            self.render()
            self.clock.tick(self.difficulty)  # Use the selected difficulty level
```

This implementation allows the user to select a difficulty level, which adjusts the game's speed, thereby meeting the requirement for multiple difficulty levels."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
