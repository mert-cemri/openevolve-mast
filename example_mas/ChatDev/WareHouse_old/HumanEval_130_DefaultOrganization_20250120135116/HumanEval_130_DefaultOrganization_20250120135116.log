This code implements the `tri` function according to the specified rules. It initializes the sequence with the first term and iteratively calculates each subsequent term based on whether the index is even or odd. The function returns a list containing the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.

[2025-20-01 13:51:36 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 To solve the task, we need to implement the `tri` function that generates the Tribonacci sequence as described. The task specifically states not to implement a GUI, so we will focus solely on the logic for generating the sequence.

### Core Function

- **tri(n):** This function will calculate and return a list of the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence based on the given rules.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

The code has a logical error in the calculation of the Tribonacci sequence for odd indices. The current implementation attempts to access `sequence[i + 1]` before it is calculated, which leads to incorrect results. The logic for calculating the Tribonacci sequence for odd numbers needs to be revised to ensure all necessary terms are available before they are used.

To fix this, we should pre-calculate the necessary terms before using them in the sequence calculation. Here's how you can revise the code:

[2025-20-01 13:51:48 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 The code has a logical error in the calculation of the Tribonacci sequence for odd indices. The current implementation attempts to access `sequence[i + 1]` before it is calculated, which leads to incorrect results. The logic for calculating the Tribonacci sequence for odd numbers needs to be revised to ensure all necessary terms are available before they are used.

To fix this, we should pre-calculate the necessary terms before using them in the sequence calculation. Here's how you can revise the code:

```python
def tri(n):
    """
    Calculate the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    Args:
    n (int): A non-negative integer representing the number of terms to generate.
    Returns:
    list: A list containing the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a non-negative integer")
    # Initialize the sequence with the first term
    sequence = [1]
    # Calculate the sequence up to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i == 1:
            sequence.append(3)
        elif i % 2 == 0:
            sequence.append(1 + i // 2)
        else:
            # Pre-calculate the next term if it doesn't exist
            if i + 1 >= len(sequence):
                sequence.append(1 + (i + 1) // 2 if (i + 1) % 2 == 0 else 0)
            sequence[i] = sequence[i - 1] + sequence[i - 2] + sequence[i + 1]
    return sequence

# Example usage:
# print(tri(3))  # Output: [1, 3, 2, 8]
```

This revision ensures that all necessary terms are calculated before they are used in the sequence.

    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    For example:

    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    Examples:

.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code contains a logical error in the calculation of the Tribonacci sequence for odd indices. The current implementation incorrectly attempts to access `sequence[i + 1]` before it is calculated, leading to incorrect results. The logic for calculating the Tribonacci sequence for odd indices should be revised to ensure the correct sequence is generated.

In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code logic for generating the Tribonacci sequence is incorrect. The recurrence relation provided in the docstring is not implemented correctly. Specifically, the calculation for odd `n` is incorrect because it attempts to access `sequence[i + 1]` before it is defined. The correct logic should ensure that the sequence is built up correctly without referencing future terms that haven't been calculated yet. 

To fix this, we need to adjust the logic for calculating the sequence, especially for odd `n`. Here's a revised version of the code:

```python

    # Calculate the sequence up to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i == 1:
            sequence.append(3)
        elif i % 2 == 0:
            sequence.append(1 + i // 2)
        else:
            # Calculate the next term based on the previous terms
            next_value = sequence[i - 1] + sequence[i - 2] + (1 + (i + 1) // 2 if (i + 1) % 2 == 0 else 3)

This code ensures that the sequence is calculated correctly by using the correct logic for odd `n` and avoids accessing undefined future terms.

Comments on Codes:
"The code logic for generating the Tribonacci sequence is incorrect. The recurrence relation provided in the docstring is not implemented correctly. Specifically, the calculation for odd `n` is incorrect because it attempts to access `sequence[i + 1]` before it is defined. The correct logic should ensure that the sequence is built up correctly without referencing future terms that haven't been calculated yet. 

To fix this, we need to adjust the logic for calculating the sequence, especially for odd `n`. Here's a revised version of the code:

```python
def tri(n):
    """
    Calculate the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    Args:
    n (int): A non-negative integer representing the number of terms to generate.
    Returns:
    list: A list containing the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a non-negative integer")
    
    # Initialize the sequence with the first term
    sequence = [1]
    
    # Calculate the sequence up to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i == 1:
            sequence.append(3)
        elif i % 2 == 0:
            sequence.append(1 + i // 2)
        else:
            # Calculate the next term based on the previous terms
            next_value = sequence[i - 1] + sequence[i - 2] + (1 + (i + 1) // 2 if (i + 1) % 2 == 0 else 3)
            sequence.append(next_value)
    
    return sequence

# Example usage:
# print(tri(3))  # Output: [1, 3, 2, 8]
```

This code ensures that the sequence is calculated correctly by using the correct logic for odd `n` and avoids accessing undefined future terms."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

# Tribonacci Sequence Generator

This software module provides a simple implementation of a Tribonacci sequence generator in Python. The Tribonacci sequence is a variation of the Fibonacci sequence, defined by a specific recurrence relation.

## Main Functionality

The main function of this module is to generate the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence, where `n` is a non-negative integer provided by the user. The sequence is defined as follows:

- `tri(1) = 3`
- `tri(n) = 1 + n / 2`, if `n` is even.
- `tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1)`, if `n` is odd.

### Example Usage

For example, calling `tri(3)` will return `[1, 3, 2, 8]`.

## Installation

This project does not require any external dependencies, so you can run it with a standard Python installation. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   If the code is hosted in a repository, clone it using:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**

   You can run the code directly using Python:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Import the Function:**

   If you want to use the `tri` function in another Python script, you can import it:

   ```python
   from main import tri
   ```

2. **Generate the Tribonacci Sequence:**

   Call the `tri` function with a non-negative integer to generate the sequence:

   ```python
   result = tri(3)
   print(result)  # Output: [1, 3, 2, 8]
   ```

## Documentation

The function is documented with a docstring that explains the parameters and return values. You can access this documentation directly in Python using the `help` function:

```python
help(tri)
```

This will display the detailed description of the function, including its arguments and expected output.

## Support

For any issues or questions, please contact the development team or submit an issue in the repository's issue tracker.

- `tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1)`, if `n` is odd.

### Example Usage

For example, calling `tri(3)` will return `[1, 3, 2, 8]`.
