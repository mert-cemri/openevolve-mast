Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and fixing a piece of software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to focus on the code implementation and ensure it functions correctly as a software tool. What are your thoughts?

To solve the task, we need to implement the function `get_closest_vowel` which finds the closest vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of a given word. The function should ignore vowels at the beginning and end of the word and return an empty string if no such vowel exists.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Identify Vowels and Consonants**: Define which characters are vowels and which are consonants.
2. **Iterate from Right to Left**: Start checking from the right side of the word to find a vowel that is between two consonants.
3. **Check Conditions**: Ensure the vowel is not at the beginning or end of the word and is surrounded by consonants.
4. **Return the Vowel**: If such a vowel is found, return it. Otherwise, return an empty string.

Now, let's implement this in the `main.py` file.

    """
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    length = len(word)
    
    # Iterate from the second last character to the second character
    for i in range(length - 2, 0, -1):
        if word[i] in vowels:
            # Check if the surrounding characters are consonants

                return word[i]
    
    return ""

```

This code defines the function `get_closest_vowel` which iterates over the word from right to left, checking for a vowel that is surrounded by consonants. If such a vowel is found, it is returned; otherwise, an empty string is returned.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required to run the function `get_closest_vowel`. The function only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for the sake of completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not require any additional packages beyond the standard Python library.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required to run the function `get_closest_vowel`. The function only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for the sake of completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that the project does not require any additional packages beyond the standard Python library. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# User Manual for `get_closest_vowel` Function

## Introduction

The `get_closest_vowel` function is a Python utility designed to identify the closest vowel in a given word that stands between two consonants, starting from the right side of the word. This function is case-sensitive and excludes vowels at the beginning and end of the word from consideration. If no such vowel is found, the function returns an empty string.

### Key Features

- **Case Sensitivity**: The function respects the case of the letters, distinguishing between uppercase and lowercase vowels.
- **Exclusion of Edge Vowels**: Vowels at the beginning and end of the word are not considered.
- **Right-to-Left Processing**: The function processes the word from right to left, ensuring the closest vowel is identified.

## Installation

This function does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

To use the `get_closest_vowel` function, follow these steps:

1. **Copy the Code**: Copy the function code into your Python script or interactive environment.

    ```python
    def get_closest_vowel(word):
        """You are given a word. Your task is to find the closest vowel that stands between 
        two consonants from the right side of the word (case sensitive).
        Vowels in the beginning and ending doesn't count. Return empty string if you didn't
        find any vowel met the above condition. 
        You may assume that the given string contains English letter only.
        Example:
        get_closest_vowel("yogurt") ==> "u"
        get_closest_vowel("FULL") ==> "U"
        get_closest_vowel("quick") ==> ""
        get_closest_vowel("ab") ==> ""
        """
        vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
        length = len(word)
        # Iterate from the second last character to the second character
        for i in range(length - 2, 0, -1):
            if word[i] in vowels:
                # Check if the surrounding characters are consonants
                if word[i-1] not in vowels and word[i+1] not in vowels:
                    return word[i]
        return ""
    ```

2. **Call the Function**: Use the function by passing a word as an argument.

    ```python
    result = get_closest_vowel("yogurt")
    print(result)  # Output: "u"
    ```

3. **Interpret the Result**: The function will return the closest vowel between two consonants from the right side of the word. If no such vowel exists, it will return an empty string.

## Examples

- `get_closest_vowel("yogurt")` returns `"u"`.
- `get_closest_vowel("FULL")` returns `"U"`.
- `get_closest_vowel("quick")` returns `""`.
- `get_closest_vowel("ab")` returns `""`.

## Conclusion

The `get_closest_vowel` function is a simple yet effective tool for identifying specific vowel patterns within words. Its straightforward implementation and lack of dependencies make it easy to integrate into larger projects or use in standalone scripts.

 # User Manual for `get_closest_vowel` Function

## Introduction

The `get_closest_vowel` function is a Python utility designed to identify the closest vowel in a given word that stands between two consonants, starting from the right side of the word. This function is case-sensitive and excludes vowels at the beginning and end of the word from consideration. If no such vowel is found, the function returns an empty string.

### Key Features

- **Case Sensitivity**: The function respects the case of the letters, distinguishing between uppercase and lowercase vowels.
- **Exclusion of Edge Vowels**: Vowels at the beginning and end of the word are not considered.
- **Right-to-Left Processing**: The function processes the word from right to left, ensuring the closest vowel is identified.

## Installation

This function does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

To use the `get_closest_vowel` function, follow these steps:

1. **Copy the Code**: Copy the function code into your Python script or interactive environment.

    ```python
    def get_closest_vowel(word):
        """You are given a word. Your task is to find the closest vowel that stands between 
        two consonants from the right side of the word (case sensitive).
        Vowels in the beginning and ending doesn't count. Return empty string if you didn't
        find any vowel met the above condition. 
        You may assume that the given string contains English letter only.
        Example:
        get_closest_vowel("yogurt") ==> "u"
        get_closest_vowel("FULL") ==> "U"
        get_closest_vowel("quick") ==> ""
        get_closest_vowel("ab") ==> ""
        """
        vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
        length = len(word)
        # Iterate from the second last character to the second character
        for i in range(length - 2, 0, -1):
            if word[i] in vowels:
                # Check if the surrounding characters are consonants
                if word[i-1] not in vowels and word[i+1] not in vowels:
                    return word[i]
        return ""
    ```

2. **Call the Function**: Use the function by passing a word as an argument.

    ```python
    result = get_closest_vowel("yogurt")
    print(result)  # Output: "u"
    ```

3. **Interpret the Result**: The function will return the closest vowel between two consonants from the right side of the word. If no such vowel exists, it will return an empty string.

## Examples

- `get_closest_vowel("yogurt")` returns `"u"`.
- `get_closest_vowel("FULL")` returns `"U"`.
- `get_closest_vowel("quick")` returns `""`.
- `get_closest_vowel("ab")` returns `""`.

## Conclusion

The `get_closest_vowel` function is a simple yet effective tool for identifying specific vowel patterns within words. Its straightforward implementation and lack of dependencies make it easy to integrate into larger projects or use in standalone scripts.
