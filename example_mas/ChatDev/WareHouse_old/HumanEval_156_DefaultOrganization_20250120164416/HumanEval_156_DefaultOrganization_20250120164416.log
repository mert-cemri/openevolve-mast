You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To complete the task, we need to implement a function `int_to_mini_roman` that converts an integer to its Roman numeral equivalent in lowercase. The task specifies that the input will be a positive integer between 1 and 1000. We will implement this function in Python without any GUI, as the task explicitly states not to implement any GUI interface or anything redundant.

Let's outline the necessary function:

1. **Function: `int_to_mini_roman`**
   - **Purpose**: Convert a given integer to its Roman numeral representation in lowercase.
   - **Input**: A positive integer `number` where 1 <= number <= 1000.
   - **Output**: A string representing the Roman numeral equivalent of the input integer in lowercase.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python

def int_to_mini_roman(number):
    """

    >>> int_to_mini_roman(152) == 'clii'
    >>> int_to_mini_roman(426) == 'cdxxvi'
    """
    # Define the Roman numeral symbols and their corresponding values
    roman_numerals = [
        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),
        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),
        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')
    ]
    
    # Initialize the result as an empty string
    result = ""
    
    # Iterate over the Roman numeral symbols
    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:
        # While the number is greater than or equal to the value
        while number >= value:
            # Append the symbol to the result
            result += symbol
            # Subtract the value from the number
            number -= value
    
    # Return the result in lowercase
    return result.lower()
```

This code defines the `int_to_mini_roman` function, which uses a list of tuples containing Roman numeral symbols and their corresponding integer values. It iterates over this list, appending the appropriate symbols to the result string while subtracting their values from the input number until the number is reduced to zero. The final result is returned in lowercase, as required by the task.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `int_to_mini_roman` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed for this project.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Roman Numeral Converter

This software provides a function to convert a positive integer into its Roman numeral equivalent, returned as a lowercase string. It is designed to handle numbers in the range from 1 to 1000.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `int_to_mini_roman(number)`. This function takes a single argument, `number`, which is a positive integer within the specified range, and returns a string representing the Roman numeral equivalent in lowercase.

### Example Usage

```python
>>> int_to_mini_roman(19)
'xix'
>>> int_to_mini_roman(152)
'clii'
>>> int_to_mini_roman(426)
'cdxxvi'
```

## Installation

### Environment Setup

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to set up and use. You only need a Python environment to run the code.

### Steps to Install

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone or download the repository containing the `main.py` file.

3. Navigate to the directory containing `main.py`.

## How to Use

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

3. Run a Python interactive shell by typing `python` and pressing Enter.

4. Import the function by typing:
   ```python
   from main import int_to_mini_roman
   ```

5. Call the function with a valid integer argument:
   ```python
   print(int_to_mini_roman(19))  # Output: xix
   ```

## Additional Information

- The function is designed to handle integers from 1 to 1000. Inputting a number outside this range will not produce a valid Roman numeral.

- The Roman numeral system used in this function follows the standard conventions, using symbols such as 'M', 'D', 'C', 'L', 'X', 'V', and 'I'.

- The output is always in lowercase, as specified in the requirements.
