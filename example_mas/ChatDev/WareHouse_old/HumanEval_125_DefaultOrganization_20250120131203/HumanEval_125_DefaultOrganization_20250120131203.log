To address the customer's task, we need to implement the `split_words` function in Python. The function should split a string based on whitespace, then commas, and finally count lowercase letters with odd alphabetical order if neither whitespace nor commas are present. The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus solely on the function implementation.

### Core Function

- **Function Name:** `split_words`
  - **Purpose:** To split a string based on whitespace or commas, or count lowercase letters with odd alphabetical order if neither is present.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python
'''
Given a string of words, return a list of words split on whitespace, if no whitespaces exist in the text you
should split on commas ',' if no commas exist you should return the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the
alphabet, ord('a') = 0, ord('b') = 1, ... ord('z') = 25
Examples:
split_words("Hello world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]
split_words("Hello,world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]
split_words("abcdef") == 3 
'''

def split_words(txt):
    # Check if there are any whitespace characters
    if ' ' in txt:
        return txt.split()
    # Check if there are any commas
    elif ',' in txt:
        return txt.split(',')
    else:
        # Calculate the number of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet
        odd_count = 0
        for char in txt:
            if char.islower():
                # Calculate the order of the character
                order = ord(char) - ord('a')
                # Check if the order is odd
                if order % 2 == 1:
                    odd_count += 1
        return odd_count

# Example usage:
# print(split_words("Hello world!"))  # ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]
# print(split_words("Hello,world!"))  # ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]
# print(split_words("abcdef"))        # ➞ 3
```

This code defines the `split_words` function according to the specifications provided. It checks for whitespace first, then commas, and finally counts lowercase letters with odd alphabetical order if neither is present. The function is ready for use and testing.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Chief Executive Officer, I confirm that the Programmer's assessment is correct. The provided code in `main.py` does not require any external libraries or packages beyond Python's standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, indicating that there are no additional dependencies needed for this project.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
