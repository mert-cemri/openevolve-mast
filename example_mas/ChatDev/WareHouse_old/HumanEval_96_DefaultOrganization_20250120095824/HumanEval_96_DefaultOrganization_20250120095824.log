Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and executing a piece of software code, I believe the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This would allow us to implement the necessary functionality in Python, as requested by the customer. What are your thoughts?

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To solve the task, we need to implement the `count_up_to` function in Python. The function should return a list of prime numbers less than the given non-negative integer `n`. Since the task specifies not to implement a GUI and only requires the necessary code, we will focus solely on the function implementation.

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Name**: `count_up_to`
   - **Purpose**: To return a list of prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer `n`.

2. **Helper Function**: `is_prime`
   - **Purpose**: To determine if a number is a prime number.

3. **Logic**:
   - If `n` is less than 2, return an empty list since there are no prime numbers less than 2.
   - Iterate through numbers from 2 to `n-1`.
   - Use the `is_prime` function to check if a number is prime.
   - Collect all prime numbers in a list and return it.

Now, let's implement the code in `main.py`.

main.py

```python
'''

This module implements the function `count_up_to` which returns a list of prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer `n`.

'''

def is_prime(num):
    """Check if a number is a prime number."""
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def count_up_to(n):
    """Return a list of prime numbers less than n."""
    return [num for num in range(2, n) if is_prime(num)]

# Example usage:
# print(count_up_to(5))  # Output: [2, 3]
# print(count_up_to(11)) # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7]
# print(count_up_to(0))  # Output: []
# print(count_up_to(20)) # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
# print(count_up_to(1))  # Output: []
# print(count_up_to(18)) # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
```

This code defines the `count_up_to` function, which uses a helper function `is_prime` to determine if a number is prime. The function then returns a list of prime numbers less than `n`. This implementation meets the requirements specified in the task description.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses built-in Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that there are no additional packages needed beyond the standard Python library.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses built-in Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that there are no additional packages needed beyond the standard Python library. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."
