# MinSubArraySum

A Python function to find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array of a given list of integers.

## Overview

The `minSubArraySum` function is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array within a list of integers. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where you need to identify the smallest possible sum that can be obtained from contiguous elements in an array.

## Features

- **Efficient Calculation**: Utilizes a linear time complexity algorithm to find the minimum sub-array sum.
- **Simple Interface**: Easy to use with a single function call.
- **No External Dependencies**: The function does not require any additional Python packages.

## Installation

Since the `minSubArraySum` function does not rely on any external libraries, there is no need for a `requirements.txt` file or additional installation steps. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Usage

To use the `minSubArraySum` function, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the function.

2. **Run the Function**: You can execute the function in a Python environment. Below is an example of how to use the function:

```python
# Import the function from the main.py file
from main import minSubArraySum

# Example usage
result1 = minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4])
print(result1)  # Output: 1

result2 = minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3])
print(result2)  # Output: -6
```

3. **Modify as Needed**: You can modify the input list to test different scenarios and find the minimum sub-array sum for various datasets.
