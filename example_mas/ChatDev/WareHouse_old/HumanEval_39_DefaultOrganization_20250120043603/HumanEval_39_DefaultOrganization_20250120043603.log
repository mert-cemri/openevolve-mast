Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and fixing code, the most appropriate product modality would be an "Application". This would allow us to implement the necessary software tool using Python, which aligns with the customer's request. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, we need to implement a function `prime_fib` that returns the n-th number which is both a Fibonacci number and a prime number. We will focus on writing the necessary code in Python without any GUI, as per the initial task requirement.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Check if a number is prime**: We need a helper function to determine if a number is prime.
2. **Generate Fibonacci numbers**: We need to generate Fibonacci numbers and check if they are prime.
3. **Return the n-th prime Fibonacci number**: We will keep track of how many prime Fibonacci numbers we have found and return the n-th one.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python
'''

This module contains the function `prime_fib` which returns the n-th number that is both a Fibonacci number and a prime number.

'''

def is_prime(num):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def prime_fib(n: int):
    """
    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.
    >>> prime_fib(1)
    2
    >>> prime_fib(2)
    3
    >>> prime_fib(3)
    5
    >>> prime_fib(4)
    13
    >>> prime_fib(5)
    89
    """
    fib1, fib2 = 1, 1
    count = 0
    while True:
        fib = fib1 + fib2
        fib1, fib2 = fib2, fib
        if is_prime(fib):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return fib
```

This code defines two functions: `is_prime` to check if a number is prime, and `prime_fib` to find the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. The `prime_fib` function generates Fibonacci numbers in a loop, checks if they are prime, and counts them until it reaches the n-th prime Fibonacci number, which it then returns.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code only uses basic Python functionality to check for prime numbers and generate Fibonacci numbers. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any external libraries beyond the standard Python library.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code only uses basic Python functionality to check for prime numbers and generate Fibonacci numbers. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that the project does not rely on any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Programmer has correctly identified, the provided code does not require any external libraries or packages beyond the standard Python library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, for completeness and to adhere to standard practices, you can include a `requirements.txt` file with a comment indicating that no external dependencies are required. Here is how it would look:

```

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:
