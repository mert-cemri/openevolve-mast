Given the task at hand, which is to write a function to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number, the most suitable product modality would be an Application. This is because the task involves implementing a piece of software code, which aligns with the capabilities of an Application in our product offerings. What are your thoughts on this?

You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To solve the task, we need to implement the Fibonacci function in Python. The task specifically asks for the implementation of the function `fib(n: int)` that returns the n-th Fibonacci number. We will focus on writing the necessary code in the `main.py` file without any GUI or additional files, as the task description does not require a GUI or a multi-file architecture.

Let's proceed with the implementation of the Fibonacci function in the `main.py` file.

```python

This module contains a function to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number.

def fib(n: int) -> int:
    """Return n-th Fibonacci number.
    
    >>> fib(10)
    55
    >>> fib(1)
    1
    >>> fib(8)
    21
    """
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 1, 1
        for _ in range(2, n):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b
```

This code defines the `fib` function that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number using an iterative approach. The function handles edge cases where `n` is less than or equal to zero by raising a `ValueError`. For `n` equal to 1 or 2, it returns 1, as the first two Fibonacci numbers are both 1. For larger values of `n`, it uses a loop to calculate the Fibonacci sequence iteratively.

This implementation is efficient and meets the requirements specified in the task.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            

def fib(n: int):
    """Return n-th Fibonacci number.
    >>> fib(10)
    55
    >>> fib(1)
    1
    >>> fib(8)
    21
    """
.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

As the Chief Executive Officer, I can confirm that the Programmer's assessment is correct. The provided code for calculating the n-th Fibonacci number does not require any external libraries or packages beyond Python's standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would indeed be empty, as no additional dependencies are necessary.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
