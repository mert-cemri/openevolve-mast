To solve the customer's task, we need to implement a function `minSubArraySum` that finds the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array of a given list of integers. The task specifically requests not to implement a GUI, so we will focus solely on the function implementation in Python.

Here is the plan:

1. **Function Name**: `minSubArraySum`
   - **Purpose**: To find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array of the input list `nums`.

2. **Approach**:
   - We will use a variation of Kadane's algorithm to find the minimum sub-array sum.
   - Initialize two variables: `current_min` to track the current sub-array sum and `global_min` to store the minimum sum found so far.
   - Iterate through the list, updating `current_min` by adding the current element or starting a new sub-array from the current element, whichever is smaller.
   - Update `global_min` if `current_min` is smaller than `global_min`.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

Given an array of integers nums, find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array
of nums.

Example:
minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]) == 1
minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]) == -6

'''

def minSubArraySum(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0  # Return 0 if the list is empty, though the problem states non-empty sub-array

    current_min = nums[0]
    global_min = nums[0]

    for num in nums[1:]:
        current_min = min(num, current_min + num)
        global_min = min(global_min, current_min)

    return global_min
```

This code will correctly compute the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array for a given list of integers.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `minSubArraySum` only uses built-in Python functionality to perform its task. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, as there are no additional packages needed.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I agree with the Programmer's assessment. The `minSubArraySum` function in the `main.py` file does not rely on any external libraries or packages; it solely uses Python's built-in capabilities. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, as there are no additional dependencies needed for this project.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project

This ensures that anyone using the project understands that no additional installations are necessary beyond having Python itself.

# minSubArraySum User Manual

## Introduction

The `minSubArraySum` function is a Python-based utility designed to find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array from a given list of integers. This function is particularly useful for tasks that require analysis of sub-array sums, such as in financial data analysis or algorithmic challenges.

## Main Functionality

- **Function Name**: `minSubArraySum`
- **Purpose**: To compute the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array within a list of integers.
- **Input**: A list of integers, `nums`.
- **Output**: An integer representing the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example 1
result = minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4])
print(result)  # Output: 1

# Example 2
result = minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3])
print(result)  # Output: -6
```

## Installation

This project does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Step-by-Step Installation Guide

1. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If the code is hosted on a version control system like GitHub, clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: 

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

4. **Run the Code**: You can execute the `main.py` file directly using Python.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Input**: Ensure your input is a list of integers. The function does not handle non-integer inputs or empty lists.

2. **Call the Function**: Use the `minSubArraySum` function with your list as the argument.

3. **Interpret the Output**: The function will return the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array.

## Additional Information

- **Edge Cases**: The function is designed to handle lists with both positive and negative integers. It assumes the list is non-empty as per the problem statement.

- **Performance**: The function efficiently computes the result in linear time, O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

## Support

For further assistance or to report issues, please contact the development team at [support@chatdev.com](mailto:support@chatdev.com).

---

This manual provides all necessary information to effectively use the `minSubArraySum` function. Ensure to follow the installation and usage instructions for optimal performance.
