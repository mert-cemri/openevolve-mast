Given the nature of the task, which involves writing a function to manipulate strings, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This modality allows us to implement the software tool using Python, which aligns with the task requirements. What are your thoughts on this choice?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" is indeed the most suitable product modality for implementing the function using Python, as it allows us to focus on the code logic without unnecessary interfaces.

To complete the task, we need to implement the `anti_shuffle` function as described. The function should take a string, split it into words, sort each word's characters by their ASCII values, and then join the words back together while preserving spaces. Here's how we can structure the code:

### Core Function
- **Function Name:** `anti_shuffle`
  - **Purpose:** To reorder the characters in each word of the input string in ascending order based on ASCII values while preserving the order of words and spaces.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

DOCSTRING

This module contains the implementation of the anti_shuffle function, which takes a string and returns an ordered version of it. The ordered version of the string is such that all words (separated by spaces) are replaced by new words where all the characters are arranged in ascending order based on ASCII value. The order of words and blank spaces in the sentence are preserved.

    """
    # Split the string into words, preserving spaces
    words = s.split(' ')
    
    # Sort each word's characters and join them back
    sorted_words = [''.join(sorted(word)) for word in words]
    
    # Join the sorted words with spaces
    return ' '.join(sorted_words)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(anti_shuffle('Hi'))  # Output: 'Hi'
    print(anti_shuffle('hello'))  # Output: 'ehllo'
    print(anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!'))  # Output: 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
```

This implementation splits the input string into words, sorts the characters in each word, and then joins them back together, preserving the spaces between words. The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how the function works with different inputs.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The `anti_shuffle` function only utilizes Python's built-in functions and libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```

This empty file signifies that the project does not require any external Python packages.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The `anti_shuffle` function only utilizes Python's built-in functions and libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

# Anti-Shuffle User Manual

Welcome to the Anti-Shuffle software, a simple yet effective tool for rearranging characters in words to create an ordered version of a string. This manual will guide you through the main functions of the software, how to install necessary dependencies, and how to use the software effectively.

## Main Functions

The primary function of this software is `anti_shuffle`, which takes a string as input and returns an ordered version of it. The ordered version of the string is such that all words (separated by spaces) are replaced by new words where all the characters are arranged in ascending order based on ASCII value. The order of words and blank spaces in the sentence are preserved.

### Example Usage

- `anti_shuffle('Hi')` returns `'Hi'`
- `anti_shuffle('hello')` returns `'ehllo'`
- `anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!')` returns `'Hello !!!Wdlor'`

## Installation

### Environment Setup

To use the Anti-Shuffle software, you need to have Python installed on your system. This software does not require any additional dependencies, so you can directly run the Python script.

### Quick Install

1. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, download and install Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Download the `main.py` file containing the `anti_shuffle` function.

3. **Run the Script**: You can run the script directly using Python. Navigate to the directory containing `main.py` and execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Open the Script**: Open `main.py` in a text editor or IDE of your choice.

2. **Modify Input**: You can modify the input string in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to test different strings.

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to see the output of the `anti_shuffle` function.

4. **Integrate into Your Project**: You can copy the `anti_shuffle` function into your own Python projects to use it as needed.

## Documentation

For further information on Python and its capabilities, please refer to the official Python documentation: [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/).

This concludes the user manual for the Anti-Shuffle software. If you have any questions or require further assistance, please feel free to reach out to our support team. Happy coding!
