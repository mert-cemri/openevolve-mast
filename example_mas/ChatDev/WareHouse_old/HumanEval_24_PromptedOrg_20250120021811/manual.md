# Largest Divisor Finder

This software module provides a simple function to find the largest divisor of a given number that is smaller than the number itself. It is implemented in Python and is designed to be straightforward and efficient for basic numerical tasks.

## Main Functionality

The primary function of this module is:

- `largest_divisor(n: int) -> int`: This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest integer that divides `n` evenly and is smaller than `n`.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import largest_divisor

result = largest_divisor(15)
print(result)  # Output: 5
```

## Installation

To use this module, you need to have Python installed on your system. The module does not require any additional dependencies beyond the Python standard library.

### Quick Install

1. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the `largest_divisor` function.

3. **Run the Function**: You can directly use the function in your Python scripts as shown in the example above.

## How to Use

1. **Import the Function**: Import the `largest_divisor` function from the `main.py` file into your Python script.

2. **Call the Function**: Pass an integer to the function and receive the largest divisor smaller than the number itself.

3. **Integration**: You can integrate this function into larger applications where you need to perform similar calculations.
