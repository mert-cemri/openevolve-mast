# Generate Integers

A simple Python application to generate even integers between two given positive integers, inclusive. This application is designed to be straightforward and efficient, providing a list of even numbers in ascending order.

## Main Functionality

The core function of this application is `generate_integers(a, b)`, which takes two positive integers `a` and `b` as input and returns a list of even integers between them, inclusive. The function ensures that the integers are returned in ascending order, regardless of whether `a` is greater than `b` or vice versa.

### Example Usage

- `generate_integers(2, 8)` returns `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
- `generate_integers(8, 2)` returns `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
- `generate_integers(10, 14)` returns `[]`
