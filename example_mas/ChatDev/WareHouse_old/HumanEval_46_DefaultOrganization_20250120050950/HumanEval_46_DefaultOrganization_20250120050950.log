Given the task is to write a piece of software code to solve a specific problem, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to focus on implementing the necessary code efficiently without any additional interfaces or formats. What are your thoughts on this?

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To solve the task, we need to implement the `fib4` function in Python to compute the n-th element of the Fib4 sequence without using recursion. The sequence is defined as follows:

- fib4(0) -> 0
- fib4(1) -> 0
- fib4(2) -> 2
- fib4(3) -> 0
- fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4) for n >= 4

Since the task specifies not to use recursion, we will use an iterative approach. We will maintain a list to store the last four computed values and update it as we compute each new term in the sequence.

Here's the implementation:

main.py

```python
def fib4(n: int) -> int:
    """

    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence. Do not use recursion.

    elif n == 3:
        return 0

    # Initialize the first four elements of the sequence
    fib_sequence = [0, 0, 2, 0]

    # Compute the sequence iteratively
    for i in range(4, n + 1):
        next_value = fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2] + fib_sequence[-3] + fib_sequence[-4]
        fib_sequence.append(next_value)
        fib_sequence.pop(0)  # Remove the oldest element to keep the list size to 4

    return fib_sequence[-1]
```

This code defines the `fib4` function, which calculates the n-th element of the Fib4 sequence using an iterative approach. The list `fib_sequence` is used to store the last four computed values, and it is updated in each iteration to compute the next value in the sequence.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# Fib4 Sequence Calculator

This software provides a function to compute the n-th element of the Fib4 number sequence, which is a variation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fib4 sequence is defined as follows:

- fib4(0) -> 0
- fib4(1) -> 0
- fib4(2) -> 2
- fib4(3) -> 0
- fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4) for n >= 4

The function is implemented iteratively to ensure efficiency and avoid the pitfalls of recursion.

## Main Functionality

The main functionality of this software is to compute the n-th element of the Fib4 sequence using the `fib4` function. This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the corresponding Fib4 number.

## Installation

This project does not require any external dependencies, so you can run it with a standard Python installation. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**

   You can run the `main.py` file to use the `fib4` function. Open a terminal in the project directory and execute:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Using the `fib4` Function:**

   You can use the `fib4` function within the `main.py` file or import it into another Python script. Here is an example of how to use it:

   ```python
   from main import fib4

   result = fib4(5)
   print(f"The 5th element of the Fib4 sequence is: {result}")
   ```

   This will output:

   ```
   The 5th element of the Fib4 sequence is: 4
   ```

## Documentation

For any further documentation or support, please refer to the comments within the `main.py` file, which provide detailed explanations of the function's logic and usage.

Feel free to reach out for support or to contribute to the project by submitting issues or pull requests on the project's repository.
