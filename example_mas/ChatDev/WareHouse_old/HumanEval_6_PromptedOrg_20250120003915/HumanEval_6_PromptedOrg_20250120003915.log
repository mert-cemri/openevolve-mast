Given the task at hand, which involves writing a function to parse nested parentheses and return a list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task involves implementing a software tool using Python code, which aligns with the Application modality. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. The task involves writing a Python function to solve a specific problem, which fits well within the "Application" modality. This modality allows us to focus on the code implementation without any additional presentation or visualization requirements. Let's proceed with this approach.

To solve the task, we need to implement the `parse_nested_parens` function in Python. This function will take a string of multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces and return a list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can implement this:

1. **Split the Input String**: We'll split the input string by spaces to get individual groups of parentheses.

2. **Calculate Nesting Level**: For each group, we'll iterate through the characters and keep track of the current nesting level using a counter. We'll also keep track of the maximum nesting level encountered.

3. **Return the Results**: After processing all groups, we'll return a list of the maximum nesting levels for each group.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python

    >>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
    [2, 3, 1, 3]
    """
    # Split the input string into individual groups of parentheses
    groups = paren_string.split()
    
    # List to store the maximum nesting level for each group
    max_nesting_levels = []
    
    # Iterate over each group
    for group in groups:
        current_level = 0
        max_level = 0
        
        # Iterate over each character in the group
        for char in group:
            if char == '(':
                current_level += 1
                # Update the maximum level if the current level is greater
                if current_level > max_level:
                    max_level = current_level
            elif char == ')':
                current_level -= 1
        
        # Append the maximum level for this group to the result list
        max_nesting_levels.append(max_level)
    
    return max_nesting_levels
```

This code defines the `parse_nested_parens` function, which processes the input string to determine the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses. The function splits the input string, iterates over each group, and calculates the maximum nesting level by tracking the current level as it encounters opening and closing parentheses. The results are returned as a list of integers.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The Programmer is correct in their assessment. The provided code for the function `parse_nested_parens` only utilizes standard Python libraries, which do not require listing in a `requirements.txt` file. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty. Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha
