To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `maximum` that takes an array of integers `arr` and a positive integer `k`, and returns a sorted list of the maximum `k` numbers in `arr`. The function should handle edge cases such as when `k` is 0 or when `k` is equal to the length of the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the implementation:

1. **Function Name**: `maximum`
   - **Purpose**: To find and return the maximum `k` numbers from the given array `arr`, sorted in ascending order.

2. **Steps to Implement**:
   - Check if `k` is 0, and if so, return an empty list.
   - Sort the array in descending order to easily access the largest elements.
   - Slice the first `k` elements from the sorted array.
   - Sort these `k` elements in ascending order before returning, as the output needs to be sorted.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python

'''

Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list 
of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.

Example 1:

    Input: arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3
    Output: [-4, -3, 5]

Example 2:

    Input: arr = [4, -4, 4], k = 2
    Output: [4, 4]

Example 3:

    Input: arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1
    Output: [2]

Note:
    1. The length of the array will be in the range of [1, 1000].
    2. The elements in the array will be in the range of [-1000, 1000].
    3. 0 <= k <= len(arr)

'''

def maximum(arr, k):
    if k == 0:
        return []
    # Sort the array in descending order
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    # Get the first k elements and sort them in ascending order
    return sorted(sorted_arr[:k])

```

This code will correctly return a sorted list of the maximum `k` numbers from the input array `arr`. It handles edge cases and adheres to the constraints provided in the task description.

   - **Purpose**: To find and return the maximum `k` numbers from the given array `arr`, sorted in ascending order.

2. **Steps to Implement**:
   - Check if `k` is 0, and if so, return an empty list.
   - Sort the array in descending order to easily access the largest elements.
   - Slice the first `k` elements from the sorted array.
   - Sort these `k` elements in ascending order before returning, as the output needs to be sorted.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python

'''

Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list 
of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.

Example 1:

    Input: arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3
    Output: [-4, -3, 5]

Example 2:

    Input: arr = [4, -4, 4], k = 2
    Output: [4, 4]

Example 3:

    Input: arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1
    Output: [2]

Note:
    1. The length of the array will be in the range of [1, 1000].
    2. The elements in the array will be in the range of [-1000, 1000].
    3. 0 <= k <= len(arr)

'''

def maximum(arr, k):
    if k == 0:
        return []
    # Sort the array in descending order
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    # Get the first k elements and sort them in ascending order
    return sorted(sorted_arr[:k])

```

This code will correctly return a sorted list of the maximum `k` numbers from the input array `arr`. It handles edge cases and adheres to the constraints provided in the task description.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `maximum` only uses Python's built-in functions and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for the sake of completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required

This indicates that there are no additional packages needed for the project to run properly.

# Maximum Function User Manual

Welcome to the user manual for the `maximum` function. This software is designed to help you find the maximum k numbers from a given list of integers and return them in sorted order. This document will guide you through the main functions of the software, how to set up your environment, and how to use the function effectively.

## Main Functionality

The `maximum` function is designed to:

- Take an array of integers and a positive integer k as inputs.
- Return a sorted list of length k containing the maximum k numbers from the array.

### Example Usage

1. **Example 1:**

   - **Input:** `arr = [-3, -4, 5]`, `k = 3`
   - **Output:** `[-4, -3, 5]`

2. **Example 2:**

   - **Input:** `arr = [4, -4, 4]`, `k = 2`
   - **Output:** `[4, 4]`

3. **Example 3:**

   - **Input:** `arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1]`, `k = 1`
   - **Output:** `[2]`

## Installation

### Environment Setup

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it easy to set up and use. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Installing Python

If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   If the code is hosted in a repository, clone it to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**

   Change into the directory where the `main.py` file is located:

   ```bash
   cd <directory-name>
   ```

3. **Run the Function:**

   You can run the function by executing the `main.py` file. Ensure you have your input array and k value ready.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Modify the `main.py` file to include your desired input values for `arr` and `k` before running the script.

## Additional Notes

- The function handles cases where `k` is 0 by returning an empty list.
- Ensure that the value of `k` is within the range `[0, len(arr)]` as per the constraints.

This concludes the user manual for the `maximum` function. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to reach out to our support team.

## Installation

### Environment Setup

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it easy to set up and use. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Installing Python

If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   If the code is hosted in a repository, clone it to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**

   Change into the directory where the `main.py` file is located:

   ```bash
   cd <directory-name>
   ```

3. **Run the Function:**

   You can run the function by executing the `main.py` file. Ensure you have your input array and k value ready.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Modify the `main.py` file to include your desired input values for `arr` and `k` before running the script.

## Additional Notes

- The function handles cases where `k` is 0 by returning an empty list.
- Ensure that the value of `k` is within the range `[0, len(arr)]` as per the constraints.

This concludes the user manual for the `maximum` function. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to reach out to our support team.
