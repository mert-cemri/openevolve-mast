# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game! This application allows two players to engage in a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe with a user-friendly graphical interface.

## Main Functions

- **Two-Player Mode**: The game allows two players to take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid.
- **Winner Determination**: The game automatically checks for a winner or a draw after each move.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The game is built using the Tkinter library, providing a simple and intuitive interface.
- **Reset Functionality**: Players can easily reset the game to start a new round.

## Installation

### Environment Setup

This application requires Python to be installed on your system. The game uses the Tkinter library, which is included with most Python installations. No additional external dependencies are required.

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**: You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Verify Tkinter Installation**: Tkinter is included with Python, but you can verify its installation by running the following command in your Python environment:

   ```bash
   python -m tkinter
   ```

   If a small window appears, Tkinter is installed correctly.

## How to Play

1. **Run the Game**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the game files. Run the following command to start the game:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Game Interface**: A window will open displaying a 3x3 grid. Players take turns clicking on the empty squares to place their mark (X or O).

3. **Winning the Game**: The game will automatically detect a win or a draw. A message will appear indicating the winner or if the game is a draw.

4. **Resetting the Game**: After a game ends, a "Play Again" button will appear. Click it to reset the board and start a new game.

## Troubleshooting

- **GUI Errors**: If you encounter an error related to the GUI, ensure you are running the game in an environment that supports Tkinter operations. Some environments, like certain remote servers, may not support GUI applications.

- **Python Version**: Ensure you are using a compatible version of Python. The game is tested with Python 3.x.
