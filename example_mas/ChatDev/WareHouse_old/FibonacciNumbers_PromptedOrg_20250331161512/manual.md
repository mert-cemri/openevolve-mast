# Fibonacci Number Generator

This application is designed to generate Fibonacci numbers up to a user-specified number. It is a simple, command-line based Python application that allows users to explore the Fibonacci sequence.

## Main Functions of the Software

The primary function of this software is to generate a list of Fibonacci numbers up to a given number specified by the user. The application prompts the user to enter a number, and then it calculates and displays the Fibonacci sequence up to that number.

### Key Features:
- **User Input**: The application prompts the user to enter an integer, which serves as the upper limit for the Fibonacci sequence.
- **Fibonacci Sequence Generation**: The application calculates the Fibonacci numbers up to the specified limit.
- **Error Handling**: The application includes basic error handling to ensure the user enters a valid integer.

## Installation and Environment Setup

This application does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. Follow the steps below to set up your environment and run the application:

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository containing the `main.py` file to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

3. **Run the Application**: Execute the following command to run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Execute the Program**: Run the `main.py` file using Python as described in the installation steps.

2. **Enter a Number**: When prompted, enter an integer. This number will be the upper limit for the Fibonacci sequence.

3. **View the Output**: The application will display the Fibonacci numbers up to the entered number.

4. **Error Handling**: If you enter a non-integer value, the application will prompt you to enter a valid integer.

## Example Usage

```bash
$ python main.py
Enter a number to generate Fibonacci numbers up to: 10
Fibonacci numbers up to 10: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```

In this example, the user entered `10`, and the application generated the Fibonacci sequence up to `10`.

## Conclusion

This Fibonacci Number Generator is a straightforward tool for generating Fibonacci sequences up to a specified limit. It is ideal for educational purposes or for anyone interested in exploring the Fibonacci sequence. Enjoy using the application!
