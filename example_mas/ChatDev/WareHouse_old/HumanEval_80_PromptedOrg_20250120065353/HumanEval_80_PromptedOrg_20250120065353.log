I agree. An "Application" is the most appropriate modality for implementing and testing the software code as per the customer's requirements. It aligns well with the task of writing a functional piece of code.

To solve the task, we need to implement the function `is_happy(s)` which checks if a given string `s` is "happy" based on the criteria that every three consecutive letters in the string are distinct. The function should return `True` if the string is happy and `False` otherwise.

Here's a breakdown of the steps needed to implement this function:

1. **Check String Length**: If the string length is less than 3, return `False` because it cannot satisfy the condition of having three consecutive distinct letters.

2. **Iterate Through the String**: Loop through the string and check every set of three consecutive characters.

3. **Check Distinct Characters**: For each set of three consecutive characters, check if all three characters are distinct.

4. **Return Result**: If any set of three consecutive characters is not distinct, return `False`. If all sets are distinct, return `True`.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains the function is_happy which checks if a string is "happy".
A string is considered happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct.

    is_happy(xyy) => False
    """
    # Check if the string length is less than 3
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    
    # Iterate through the string and check every set of 3 consecutive characters
    for i in range(len(s) - 2):
        # Extract three consecutive characters
        a, b, c = s[i], s[i+1], s[i+2]
        
        # Check if all three characters are distinct
        if a == b or b == c or a == c:
            return False
    
    # If all sets of three consecutive characters are distinct, return True
    return True
```

This code defines the `is_happy` function which checks if a string is "happy" by ensuring that every three consecutive characters in the string are distinct. If any set of three consecutive characters is not distinct, the function returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Since the provided code for the `is_happy` function does not use any external libraries or packages, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty. This indicates that there are no additional dependencies needed for the project to run properly.

# is_happy Function User Manual

Welcome to the user manual for the `is_happy` function. This document will guide you through the purpose of the function, how to install any necessary dependencies, and how to use the function effectively.

## Introduction

The `is_happy` function is a simple utility designed to determine whether a given string is "happy." A string is considered happy if its length is at least 3 and every set of 3 consecutive letters within the string are distinct. This function is useful for validating strings based on this specific criterion.

### Main Functionality

- **is_happy(s)**: This function takes a single argument, `s`, which is a string. It returns `True` if the string is happy, and `False` otherwise.

### Examples

- `is_happy("a")` returns `False`
- `is_happy("aa")` returns `False`
- `is_happy("abcd")` returns `True`
- `is_happy("aabb")` returns `False`
- `is_happy("adb")` returns `True`
- `is_happy("xyy")` returns `False`

## Installation

The `is_happy` function does not require any external dependencies. It is implemented in pure Python, so you only need a Python environment to run it.

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or Download the Code**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the `is_happy` function. You can clone the repository or download the file directly.

3. **Run the Function**: You can run the function in any Python environment, such as a terminal, command prompt, or an integrated development environment (IDE) like PyCharm or VSCode.

## Usage

To use the `is_happy` function, follow these steps:

1. **Open your Python environment**: This could be a terminal, command prompt, or an IDE.

2. **Import the Function**: If you have saved the `main.py` file in your project, you can import the function using:
   ```python
   from main import is_happy
   ```

3. **Call the Function**: Pass a string to the `is_happy` function to check if it is happy:
   ```python
   result = is_happy("your_string_here")
   print(result)
   ```

4. **Interpret the Result**: The function will return `True` if the string is happy and `False` otherwise.

## Conclusion

The `is_happy` function is a straightforward utility for checking the happiness of strings based on the distinctness of every 3 consecutive characters. With no external dependencies, it is easy to integrate into any Python project. Enjoy using the `is_happy` function to validate your strings!
