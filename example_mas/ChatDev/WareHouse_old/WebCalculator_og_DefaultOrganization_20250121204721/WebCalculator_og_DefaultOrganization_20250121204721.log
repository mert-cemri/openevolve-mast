To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To implement a simple responsive web-based calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, we will create a single-page application. The application will consist of the following core components:

1. **HTML Structure**: This will define the layout of the calculator, including the display area and the numeric keypad with operation buttons.

2. **CSS Styling**: This will ensure the calculator has a clean, intuitive UI layout and is responsive to various screen sizes.

3. **JavaScript Logic**: This will handle the calculator's functionality, including capturing user input, performing calculations, and updating the display.

### Core Components and Their Purpose:

- **HTML File (`index.html`)**: Defines the structure of the calculator UI.
- **CSS File (`styles.css`)**: Provides styling to ensure the UI is clean and responsive.
- **JavaScript File (`script.js`)**: Implements the logic for handling user interactions and performing calculations.

Let's implement each of these components:

3. **JavaScript Logic**: This will handle the calculator's functionality, including capturing user input, performing calculations, and updating the display.

### Core Components and Their Purpose:

- **HTML File (`index.html`)**: Defines the structure of the calculator UI.
- **CSS File (`styles.css`)**: Provides styling to ensure the UI is clean and responsive.
- **JavaScript File (`script.js`)**: Implements the logic for handling user interactions and performing calculations.

Let's implement each of these components:

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Implement a simple responsive web-based calculator. Provide a numeric keypad, basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide), and a display area to show results. Use a clean, intuitive UI layout, ensuring it works on various screen sizes..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly functional and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with handling division by zero, which could result in an error or an unexpected result. This is a critical aspect that needs to be addressed to ensure robustness and prevent any runtime errors.

### Comment with the Highest Priority:
The calculator does not handle division by zero, which can lead to a runtime error or an undefined result. This needs to be handled gracefully to ensure the application remains stable and provides a meaningful response to the user.

### Suggestions on Revision:
1. Modify the `calculate` function in `script.js` to include a check for division by zero.
2. If a division by zero is attempted, display an error message or a specific value (e.g., "Error" or "Infinity") on the calculator display.

### Revised `calculate` Function:
```js
function calculate(first, second, operator) {
    const num1 = parseFloat(first);
    const num2 = parseFloat(second);
    switch (operator) {
        case '+':
            return (num1 + num2).toString();
        case '-':
            return (num1 - num2).toString();
        case '*':
            return (num1 * num2).toString();
        case '/':
            if (num2 === 0) {
                return "Error"; // Handle division by zero
            }
            return (num1 / num2).toString();
        default:
            return second;
    }
}
```

Implement this change to ensure the calculator handles division by zero gracefully.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is mostly functional and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with handling division by zero, which could result in an error or an unexpected result. This is a critical aspect that needs to be addressed to ensure robustness and prevent any runtime errors.

### Comment with the Highest Priority:
The calculator does not handle division by zero, which can lead to a runtime error or an undefined result. This needs to be handled gracefully to ensure the application remains stable and provides a meaningful response to the user.

### Suggestions on Revision:
1. Modify the `calculate` function in `script.js` to include a check for division by zero.
2. If a division by zero is attempted, display an error message or a specific value (e.g., "Error" or "Infinity") on the calculator display.

### Revised `calculate` Function:
```js
function calculate(first, second, operator) {
    const num1 = parseFloat(first);
    const num2 = parseFloat(second);
    switch (operator) {
        case '+':
            return (num1 + num2).toString();
        case '-':
            return (num1 - num2).toString();
        case '*':
            return (num1 * num2).toString();
        case '/':
            if (num2 === 0) {
                return "Error"; // Handle division by zero
            }
            return (num1 / num2).toString();
        default:
            return second;
    }
}
```

Implement this change to ensure the calculator handles division by zero gracefully."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The code provided is mostly well-structured and meets the requirements of the task. However, there is a potential issue with the handling of the initial display value and the input of multiple operators consecutively, which could lead to unexpected behavior. 

### Comment with Highest Priority:
The calculator does not handle consecutive operator inputs correctly. For example, if a user inputs "5 + + 3", the calculator should ideally ignore the second "+" or replace the first one, but currently, it may lead to incorrect calculations or errors.

### Suggestions on Revision:
1. **Prevent Consecutive Operators**: Modify the event listener logic to prevent consecutive operators from being added to the input. You can achieve this by checking if the last character of `currentInput` is an operator before allowing another operator to be added.

2. **Initial Display Value**: Ensure that the display does not start with "0" when the user begins inputting numbers. This can be done by resetting `currentInput` to an empty string when the first number is entered.

Here is a suggested modification to the `script.js`:

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const display = document.getElementById('display');
    let currentInput = '';
    let operator = null;
    let firstOperand = null;
    document.querySelectorAll('.btn').forEach(button => {
        button.addEventListener('click', () => {
            const value = button.getAttribute('data-value');
            if (value === '=') {
                if (firstOperand !== null && operator !== null) {
                    currentInput = calculate(firstOperand, currentInput, operator);
                    display.innerText = currentInput;
                    firstOperand = null;
                    operator = null;
                }
            } else if (['+', '-', '*', '/'].includes(value)) {
                if (currentInput === '' && firstOperand === null) return; // Prevent starting with an operator
                if (operator !== null && currentInput === '') return; // Prevent consecutive operators
                if (firstOperand === null) {
                    firstOperand = currentInput;
                    operator = value;
                    currentInput = '';
                } else if (operator !== null) {
                    firstOperand = calculate(firstOperand, currentInput, operator);

                    currentInput = '';
                    display.innerText = firstOperand;
                }
            } else {
                if (currentInput === '0') currentInput = ''; // Remove leading zero
                currentInput += value;
                display.innerText = currentInput;
            }
        });
    });
    function calculate(first, second, operator) {
        const num1 = parseFloat(first);
        const num2 = parseFloat(second);

[2025-21-01 20:49:18 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 The code provided is mostly well-structured and meets the requirements of the task. However, there is a potential issue with the handling of the initial display value and the input of multiple operators consecutively, which could lead to unexpected behavior. 

### Comment with Highest Priority:
The calculator does not handle consecutive operator inputs correctly. For example, if a user inputs "5 + + 3", the calculator should ideally ignore the second "+" or replace the first one, but currently, it may lead to incorrect calculations or errors.

### Suggestions on Revision:
1. **Prevent Consecutive Operators**: Modify the event listener logic to prevent consecutive operators from being added to the input. You can achieve this by checking if the last character of `currentInput` is an operator before allowing another operator to be added.

2. **Initial Display Value**: Ensure that the display does not start with "0" when the user begins inputting numbers. This can be done by resetting `currentInput` to an empty string when the first number is entered.

Here is a suggested modification to the `script.js`:

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const display = document.getElementById('display');
    let currentInput = '';
    let operator = null;
    let firstOperand = null;
    document.querySelectorAll('.btn').forEach(button => {
        button.addEventListener('click', () => {
            const value = button.getAttribute('data-value');
            if (value === '=') {
                if (firstOperand !== null && operator !== null) {
                    currentInput = calculate(firstOperand, currentInput, operator);
                    display.innerText = currentInput;
                    firstOperand = null;
                    operator = null;
                }
            } else if (['+', '-', '*', '/'].includes(value)) {
                if (currentInput === '' && firstOperand === null) return; // Prevent starting with an operator
                if (operator !== null && currentInput === '') return; // Prevent consecutive operators
                if (firstOperand === null) {
                    firstOperand = currentInput;
                    operator = value;
                    currentInput = '';
                } else if (operator !== null) {
                    firstOperand = calculate(firstOperand, currentInput, operator);
                    operator = value;
                    currentInput = '';
                    display.innerText = firstOperand;
                }
            } else {
                if (currentInput === '0') currentInput = ''; // Remove leading zero
                currentInput += value;
                display.innerText = currentInput;
            }
        });
    });
    function calculate(first, second, operator) {
        const num1 = parseFloat(first);
        const num2 = parseFloat(second);
        switch (operator) {
            case '+':
                return (num1 + num2).toString();
            case '-':
                return (num1 - num2).toString();
            case '*':
                return (num1 * num2).toString();
            case '/':
                if (num2 === 0) {
                    return "Error"; // Handle division by zero
                }
                return (num1 / num2).toString();
            default:
                return second;
        }
    }

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is mostly well-structured and meets the requirements of the task. However, there is a potential issue with the handling of the initial display value and the input of multiple operators consecutively, which could lead to unexpected behavior. 

### Comment with Highest Priority:
The calculator does not handle consecutive operator inputs correctly. For example, if a user inputs "5 + + 3", the calculator should ideally ignore the second "+" or replace the first one, but currently, it may lead to incorrect calculations or errors.

### Suggestions on Revision:
1. **Prevent Consecutive Operators**: Modify the event listener logic to prevent consecutive operators from being added to the input. You can achieve this by checking if the last character of `currentInput` is an operator before allowing another operator to be added.

2. **Initial Display Value**: Ensure that the display does not start with "0" when the user begins inputting numbers. This can be done by resetting `currentInput` to an empty string when the first number is entered.

Here is a suggested modification to the `script.js`:

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const display = document.getElementById('display');
    let currentInput = '';
    let operator = null;
    let firstOperand = null;
    document.querySelectorAll('.btn').forEach(button => {
        button.addEventListener('click', () => {
            const value = button.getAttribute('data-value');
            if (value === '=') {
                if (firstOperand !== null && operator !== null) {
                    currentInput = calculate(firstOperand, currentInput, operator);
                    display.innerText = currentInput;
                    firstOperand = null;
                    operator = null;
                }
            } else if (['+', '-', '*', '/'].includes(value)) {
                if (currentInput === '' && firstOperand === null) return; // Prevent starting with an operator
                if (operator !== null && currentInput === '') return; // Prevent consecutive operators
                if (firstOperand === null) {
                    firstOperand = currentInput;
                    operator = value;
                    currentInput = '';
                } else if (operator !== null) {
                    firstOperand = calculate(firstOperand, currentInput, operator);
                    operator = value;
                    currentInput = '';

            }

However, there is a potential issue with the handling of the initial display value and the input of multiple operators consecutively, which could lead to unexpected behavior. \n\n### Comment with Highest Priority:\nThe calculator does not handle consecutive operator inputs correctly. For example, if a user inputs "5 + + 3", the calculator should ideally ignore the second "+" or replace the first one, but currently, it may lead to incorrect calculations or errors.\n\n### Suggestions on Revision:\n1. Prevent Consecutive Operators: Modify the event listener logic to prevent consecutive operators from being added to the input. You can achieve this by checking if the last character of currentInput is an operator before allowing another operator to be added.\n\n2. Initial Display Value*: Ensure that the display does not start with "0" when the user begins inputting numbers. This can be done by resetting currentInput to an empty string when the first number is entered.\n\nHere is a suggested modification to the script.js:\n\njs\ndocument.addEventListener(\'DOMContentLoaded\', function() {\n    const display = document.getElementById(\'display\');\n    let currentInput = \'\';\n    let operator = null;\n    let firstOperand = null;\n    document.querySelectorAll(\'.btn\').forEach(button =&gt; {\n        button.addEventListener(\'click\', () =&gt; {\n            const value = button.getAttribute(\'data-value\');\n            if (value === \'=\') {\n                if (firstOperand !== null &amp;&amp; operator !== null) {\n                    currentInput = calculate(firstOperand, currentInput, operator);\n                    display.innerText = currentInput;\n                    firstOperand = null;\n                    operator = null;\n                }\n            } else if ([\'+\', \'-\', \'*\', \'/\'].includes(value)) {\n                if (currentInput === \'\' &amp;&amp; firstOperand === null) return; // Prevent starting with an operator\n                if (operator !== null &amp;&amp; currentInput === \'\') return; // Prevent consecutive operators\n                if (firstOperand === null) {\n                    firstOperand = currentInput;\n                    operator = value;\n                    currentInput = \'\';\n                } else if (operator !== null) {\n                    firstOperand = calculate(firstOperand, currentInput, operator);\n                    operator = value;\n                    currentInput = \'\';\n                    display.innerText = firstOperand;\n                }\n            } else {\n                if (currentInput === \'0\') currentInput = \'\'; // Remove leading zero\n                currentInput += value;\n                display.innerText = currentInput;\n            }\n        });\n    });\n    function calculate(first, second, operator) {\n        const num1 = parseFloat(first);\n        const num2 = parseFloat(second);\n        switch (operator) {\n            case \'+\':\n                return (num1 + num2).toString();\n            case \'-\':\n                return (num1 - num2).toString();\n            case \'*\':\n                return (num1 * num2).toString();\n            case \'/\':\n                if (num2 === 0) {\n                    return "Error"; // Handle division by zero\n                }\n                return (num1 / num2).toString();\n            default:\n                return second;\n        }\n    }\n});\n\n\nImplement these changes to ensure a more robust and user-friendly calculator experience.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the user's requirements. However, there is a potential issue with handling multiple decimal points in the input, which could lead to incorrect calculations or unexpected behavior.

**Comment with Highest Priority:**
The current implementation does not prevent the user from entering multiple decimal points in a single number, which can lead to invalid numeric input and calculation errors.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
To fix this, modify the event listener for button clicks to check if the current input already contains a decimal point before allowing another one to be added. Update the JavaScript code as follows:

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const display = document.getElementById('display');
    let currentInput = '';
    let operator = null;
    let firstOperand = null;
    document.querySelectorAll('.btn').forEach(button => {
        button.addEventListener('click', () => {
            const value = button.getAttribute('data-value');
            if (value === '=') {
                if (firstOperand !== null && operator !== null) {
                    currentInput = calculate(firstOperand, currentInput, operator);
                    display.innerText = currentInput;
                    firstOperand = null;
                    operator = null;
                }
            } else if (['+', '-', '*', '/'].includes(value)) {
                if (currentInput === '' && firstOperand === null) return; // Prevent starting with an operator
                if (operator !== null && currentInput === '') return; // Prevent consecutive operators
                if (firstOperand === null) {
                    firstOperand = currentInput;
                    operator = value;
                    currentInput = '';
                } else if (operator !== null) {
                    firstOperand = calculate(firstOperand, currentInput, operator);
                    operator = value;
                    currentInput = '';
                    display.innerText = firstOperand;
                }
            } else if (value === '.') {
                if (!currentInput.includes('.')) {
                    currentInput += value;
                    display.innerText = currentInput;
                }
            } else {
                if (currentInput === '0') currentInput = ''; // Remove leading zero
                currentInput += value;
                display.innerText = currentInput;
            }
        });
    });
    function calculate(first, second, operator) {
        const num1 = parseFloat(first);
        const num2 = parseFloat(second);
        switch (operator) {
            case '+':
                return (num1 + num2).toString();
            case '-':
                return (num1 - num2).toString();
            case '*':
                return (num1 * num2).toString();
            case '/':
                if (num2 === 0) {
                    return "Error"; // Handle division by zero
                }
                return (num1 / num2).toString();
            default:
                return second;
        }
    }
});
```

This update ensures that only one decimal point can be added to a number, maintaining valid numeric input for calculations.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the user's requirements. However, there is a potential issue with handling multiple decimal points in the input, which could lead to incorrect calculations or unexpected behavior.

**Comment with Highest Priority:**
The current implementation does not prevent the user from entering multiple decimal points in a single number, which can lead to invalid numeric input and calculation errors.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
To fix this, modify the event listener for button clicks to check if the current input already contains a decimal point before allowing another one to be added. Update the JavaScript code as follows:

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const display = document.getElementById('display');
    let currentInput = '';
    let operator = null;
    let firstOperand = null;
    document.querySelectorAll('.btn').forEach(button => {
        button.addEventListener('click', () => {
            const value = button.getAttribute('data-value');
            if (value === '=') {
                if (firstOperand !== null && operator !== null) {
                    currentInput = calculate(firstOperand, currentInput, operator);
                    display.innerText = currentInput;
                    firstOperand = null;
                    operator = null;
                }
            } else if (['+', '-', '*', '/'].includes(value)) {
                if (currentInput === '' && firstOperand === null) return; // Prevent starting with an operator
                if (operator !== null && currentInput === '') return; // Prevent consecutive operators
                if (firstOperand === null) {
                    firstOperand = currentInput;
                    operator = value;
                    currentInput = '';
                } else if (operator !== null) {
                    firstOperand = calculate(firstOperand, currentInput, operator);
                    operator = value;
                    currentInput = '';
                    display.innerText = firstOperand;
                }
            } else if (value === '.') {
                if (!currentInput.includes('.')) {
                    currentInput += value;
                    display.innerText = currentInput;
                }
            } else {
                if (currentInput === '0') currentInput = ''; // Remove leading zero
                currentInput += value;
                display.innerText = currentInput;
            }
        });
    });
    function calculate(first, second, operator) {
        const num1 = parseFloat(first);
        const num2 = parseFloat(second);
        switch (operator) {
            case '+':
                return (num1 + num2).toString();
            case '-':
                return (num1 - num2).toString();
            case '*':
                return (num1 * num2).toString();
            case '/':
                if (num2 === 0) {
                    return "Error"; // Handle division by zero
                }
                return (num1 / num2).toString();
            default:
                return second;
        }
    }
});
```

This update ensures that only one decimal point can be added to a number, maintaining valid numeric input for calculations."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

For the given project, which is a web-based calculator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, there are no external Python dependencies or packages required. The project is entirely client-side and does not involve any server-side Python code or libraries. Therefore, a `requirements.txt` file is not applicable in this context.

However, if you were to use any JavaScript libraries or frameworks (like React, Vue.js, or jQuery), you would typically manage those dependencies using a `package.json` file with npm (Node Package Manager) rather than a `requirements.txt` file.

Since this project does not require any additional packages, there is no need for a `requirements.txt` file. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given project, which is a web-based calculator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, there are no external Python dependencies or packages required. The project is entirely client-side and does not involve any server-side Python code or libraries. Therefore, a `requirements.txt` file is not applicable in this context.
However, if you were to use any JavaScript libraries or frameworks (like React, Vue.js, or jQuery), you would typically manage those dependencies using a `package.json` file with npm (Node Package Manager) rather than a `requirements.txt` file.
Since this project does not require any additional packages, there is no need for a `requirements.txt` file. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Since this project is entirely client-side and does not involve any server-side Python code or libraries, a `requirements.txt` file, which is typically used for Python projects, is not applicable here.

However, if there were any JavaScript libraries or frameworks involved, such as React, Vue.js, or jQuery, we would manage those dependencies using a `package.json` file with npm (Node Package Manager). In this case, since the project does not require any additional packages, there is no need for a `requirements.txt` file.

If there are any further questions or if additional features are needed for the project, please feel free to reach out for further assistance.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
