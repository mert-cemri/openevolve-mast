As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To solve the task, we need to implement the function `Strongest_Extension` which calculates the strength of each extension based on the number of uppercase and lowercase letters, and returns the strongest extension in the specified format. Here's how we can structure the implementation:

### Core Function:
- **Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):** This function will iterate through the list of extensions, calculate the strength for each, and determine the strongest one. It will return the class name concatenated with the strongest extension.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains the implementation of the Strongest_Extension function.
The function calculates the strength of each extension based on the number of uppercase and lowercase letters,
and returns the strongest extension in the format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.

'''

def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    def calculate_strength(extension):
        cap_count = sum(1 for c in extension if c.isupper())

```

This code defines the `Strongest_Extension` function, which calculates the strength of each extension and returns the strongest one in the specified format. The `calculate_strength` helper function is used to determine the strength of each extension. The function iterates through the list of extensions, updating the strongest extension found so far, and finally returns the result in the required format.

 To solve the task, we need to implement the function `Strongest_Extension` which calculates the strength of each extension based on the number of uppercase and lowercase letters, and returns the strongest extension in the specified format. Here's how we can structure the implementation:

### Core Function:
- **Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):** This function will iterate through the list of extensions, calculate the strength for each, and determine the strongest one. It will return the class name concatenated with the strongest extension.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains the implementation of the Strongest_Extension function.
The function calculates the strength of each extension based on the number of uppercase and lowercase letters,
and returns the strongest extension in the format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.

    return f"{class_name}.{strongest_extension}"

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Code Reviewer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to review and assess source code written by programmers. You ensure code quality by identifying bugs, optimizing performance, and enforcing coding standards. You provide constructive feedback to improve software robustness.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and work closely with programmers.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

    in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM. 
    You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this 
    format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.
    If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code, there are no external libraries or dependencies used. The function `Strongest_Extension` relies solely on Python's built-in capabilities. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no additional packages required.
Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:
```
```
This indicates that no external dependencies are needed for the project to run properly. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of ChatDev. Your primary responsibilities include making high-level decisions about policy and strategy, overseeing the overall operations and resources of ChatDev, and acting as the main point of communication between the board and corporate operations.
As the CEO, you have the authority to make final decisions and terminate conversations when appropriate.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    """You will be given the name of a class (a string) and a list of extensions.
    The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class. The
    strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase
    letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters 
    in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM. 
    You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this 
    format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.
    If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should
    choose the one that comes first in the list.
    For example, if you are given "Slices" as the class and a list of the
    extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should
    return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension 
    (its strength is -1).
    Example:
    for Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']) == 'my_class.AA'
    """
.
To complete the task, you will provide strategic guidance and instructions to your team, ensuring that the solution meets the customer's needs and aligns with the company's objectives.]

# Strongest Extension User Manual

Welcome to the Strongest Extension software! This tool is designed to help you determine the strongest extension for a given class name based on the strength of each extension. The strength is calculated by the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in the extension's name.

## Main Functionality

The primary function of this software is:

- **Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):** This function takes a class name and a list of extensions. It calculates the strength of each extension and returns the strongest one in the format: `ClassName.StrongestExtensionName`. If multiple extensions have the same strength, the one appearing first in the list is chosen.

## Installation

To use the Strongest Extension software, you need to have Python installed on your system. The software does not require any additional dependencies, so you can directly use it without installing any external packages.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or download the repository:** Obtain the `main.py` file containing the Strongest Extension function.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare your environment:** Ensure you have Python installed and the `main.py` file available in your working directory.

2. **Run the function:**

   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.
   - Use a Python interpreter to run the script and call the `Strongest_Extension` function with your desired class name and list of extensions.

   Example usage:
   ```python
   # In your Python environment
   from main import Strongest_Extension

   # Example 1
   result1 = Strongest_Extension('Slices', ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'])
   print(result1)  # Output: 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes'

   # Example 2
   result2 = Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC'])
   print(result2)  # Output: 'my_class.AA'
   ```

3. **Interpret the results:** The function will return the strongest extension in the specified format. Use this result as needed in your application.

## Documentation

For further information and examples, please refer to the comments within the `main.py` file. The code is documented to help you understand the logic and usage of the function.

Thank you for using the Strongest Extension software! If you have any questions or need support, please feel free to reach out.
