# Sum to N Function

This software provides a simple Python function to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to a given number `n`. It is designed to be straightforward and efficient, using Python's built-in capabilities.

## Main Function

The main function provided by this software is `sum_to_n`. This function takes a single integer input `n` and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`.

### Function Signature

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int) -> int:
```

### Example Usage

```python
>>> sum_to_n(30)
465
>>> sum_to_n(100)
5050
>>> sum_to_n(5)
15
>>> sum_to_n(10)
55
>>> sum_to_n(1)
1
```

## Installation

This project does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. You can run the function in any standard Python environment.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the repository**: If the code is hosted in a repository, clone it to your local machine. Otherwise, simply copy the `main.py` file to your working directory.

3. **Run the code**: You can execute the function directly in a Python interpreter or include it in your own scripts.

## How to Use

1. **Open a Python environment**: You can use any Python IDE or the command line.

2. **Import the function**: If you have saved the function in a file named `main.py`, you can import it using:

   ```python
   from main import sum_to_n
   ```

3. **Call the function**: Pass an integer to the function to get the sum of numbers from 1 to that integer.

   ```python
   result = sum_to_n(10)
   print(result)  # Output will be 55
   ```
