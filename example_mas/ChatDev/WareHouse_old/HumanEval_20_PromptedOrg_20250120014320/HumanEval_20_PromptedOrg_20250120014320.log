Given the task at hand, which involves writing a piece of software code to solve a specific problem, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a functional piece of software, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To solve the task, we need to implement the function `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of floating-point numbers and returns a tuple of two numbers that are closest to each other. The function should return the numbers in ascending order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can implement this:

1. **Sort the List**: Sorting the list will help us easily find the closest numbers because the closest numbers will be adjacent to each other in a sorted list.

2. **Initialize Variables**: We need to keep track of the smallest difference found and the pair of numbers that have this smallest difference.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: Compare each pair of adjacent numbers in the sorted list to find the pair with the smallest difference.

4. **Return the Result**: Once the smallest difference is found, return the pair of numbers in ascending order.

Now, let's implement this in the `main.py` file.

main.py

```python

'''

From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

'''

from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    # Sort the numbers to make it easier to find the closest pair
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    
    # Initialize the smallest difference to a large number
    smallest_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (sorted_numbers[0], sorted_numbers[1])
    
    # Iterate through the sorted list to find the closest pair
    for i in range(len(sorted_numbers) - 1):
        # Calculate the difference between consecutive numbers
        diff = sorted_numbers[i + 1] - sorted_numbers[i]
        
        # If this difference is smaller than the smallest found so far, update
        if diff < smallest_diff:
            smallest_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (sorted_numbers[i], sorted_numbers[i + 1])
    
    return closest_pair

```

This code will correctly find and return the two closest numbers from the list, ensuring they are returned in ascending order. The function is efficient due to the initial sorting step, which allows us to only compare adjacent elements to find the closest pair.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required, as it only uses Python's built-in functions and types. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you want to include a placeholder or a comment for clarity, you can do so as follows:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any additional packages outside of the standard Python library.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required, as it only uses Python's built-in functions and types. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you want to include a placeholder or a comment for clarity, you can do so as follows:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```
This indicates that the project does not rely on any additional packages outside of the standard Python library. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Find Closest Elements

A Python utility to find and return two numbers from a list that are closest to each other. The numbers are returned in order, with the smaller number first.

## Overview

This software provides a simple function `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of floating-point numbers and returns a tuple containing the two numbers that are closest to each other in the list. This can be useful in various applications where proximity between numerical values is of interest.

## Main Function

### `find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]`

- **Description**: From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two), this function selects and returns two numbers that are the closest to each other. The numbers are returned in order, with the smaller number first.

- **Parameters**:
  - `numbers`: A list of floating-point numbers with at least two elements.

- **Returns**: A tuple containing the two closest numbers, ordered from smallest to largest.

- **Example Usage**:
  ```python
  from main import find_closest_elements

  result = find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
  print(result)  # Output: (2.0, 2.2)
  ```

## Installation

### Environment Setup

This project does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

# Find Closest Elements

A Python utility to find and return two numbers from a list that are closest to each other. The numbers are returned in order, with the smaller number first.

## Overview

This software provides a simple function `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of floating-point numbers and returns a tuple containing the two numbers that are closest to each other in the list. This can be useful in various applications where proximity between numerical values is of interest.

## Main Function

### `find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]`

- **Description**: From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two), this function selects and returns two numbers that are the closest to each other. The numbers are returned in order, with the smaller number first.

- **Parameters**:
  - `numbers`: A list of floating-point numbers with at least two elements.

- **Returns**: A tuple containing the two closest numbers, ordered from smallest to largest.

- **Example Usage**:
  ```python
  from main import find_closest_elements

  result = find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
  print(result)  # Output: (2.0, 2.2)
  ```
