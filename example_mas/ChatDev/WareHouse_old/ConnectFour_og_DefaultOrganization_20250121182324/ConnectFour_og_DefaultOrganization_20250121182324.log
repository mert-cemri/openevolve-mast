To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Implement a standard Connect Four game. Two players alternate placing discs into a seven-column, six-row grid. The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs. Players choose columns by typing a number, and the board updates after each move until a win or draw.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To implement the Connect Four game with a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python, we'll use the `tkinter` library for the GUI. The game will consist of several components, including the main game logic, the GUI setup, and utility functions to handle game state and user interactions.

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **ConnectFourGame**: This class will handle the game logic, including checking for wins, handling player turns, and managing the game board state.
   - `__init__`: Initialize the game board and set the starting player.
   - `drop_disc`: Handle the logic for dropping a disc into a column.
   - `check_winner`: Check if the current move resulted in a win.
   - `is_draw`: Check if the game is a draw.

2. **ConnectFourGUI**: This class will manage the GUI components using `tkinter`.
   - `__init__`: Set up the GUI window and initialize the game board display.
   - `create_board`: Create the visual representation of the game board.
   - `update_board`: Update the board display after each move.
   - `handle_click`: Handle user input when a column is selected.

3. **Utility Functions**: Functions to assist with game logic, such as checking lines for a win.

### File Structure

1. `main.py`: The main entry point for the application, initializing the GUI and starting the game.

Let's start by implementing the `main.py` file.

#### main.py

```python
'''

Main entry point for the Connect Four game application.

'''

These codes implement a Connect Four game with a graphical user interface using Python's `tkinter` library. The game logic is encapsulated in the `ConnectFourGame` class, while the GUI is managed by the `ConnectFourGUI` class. The main entry point initializes the game and starts the GUI event loop.

These codes implement a Connect Four game with a graphical user interface using Python's `tkinter` library. The game logic is encapsulated in the `ConnectFourGame` class, while the GUI is managed by the `ConnectFourGUI` class. The main entry point initializes the game and starts the GUI event loop.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Implement a standard Connect Four game. Two players alternate placing discs into a seven-column, six-row grid. The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs. Players choose columns by typing a number, and the board updates after each move until a win or draw..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs. Players choose columns by typing a number, and the board updates after each move until a win or draw..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code implementation for the Connect Four game is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the user interface that could affect user experience. The buttons for dropping discs are labeled with "Drop 1", "Drop 2", etc., which might be confusing for users who expect to input column numbers starting from 1, but the internal logic uses zero-based indexing. This could lead to a mismatch in user expectations and actual game behavior.

To fix this, you should adjust the button labels to match the zero-based indexing used internally, or alternatively, adjust the internal logic to accommodate one-based indexing as users might expect. Here's how you can adjust the button labels:

```python
def create_board(self):
    for col in range(self.game.columns):
        button = tk.Button(self.root, text=f"Drop {col}", command=lambda c=col: self.handle_click(c))
        button.grid(row=0, column=col)
        self.buttons.append(button)
```

This change ensures that the button labels accurately reflect the column numbers used in the game logic, preventing any confusion for the user.

Comments on Codes:
"The code implementation for the Connect Four game is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the user interface that could affect user experience. The buttons for dropping discs are labeled with "Drop 1", "Drop 2", etc., which might be confusing for users who expect to input column numbers starting from 1, but the internal logic uses zero-based indexing. This could lead to a mismatch in user expectations and actual game behavior.

To fix this, you should adjust the button labels to match the zero-based indexing used internally, or alternatively, adjust the internal logic to accommodate one-based indexing as users might expect. Here's how you can adjust the button labels:

```python
def create_board(self):
    for col in range(self.game.columns):
        button = tk.Button(self.root, text=f"Drop {col}", command=lambda c=col: self.handle_click(c))
        button.grid(row=0, column=col)
        self.buttons.append(button)
```

This change ensures that the button labels accurately reflect the column numbers used in the game logic, preventing any confusion for the user."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Implement a standard Connect Four game. Two players alternate placing discs into a seven-column, six-row grid. The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs. Players choose columns by typing a number, and the board updates after each move until a win or draw..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Implement a standard Connect Four game. Two players alternate placing discs into a seven-column, six-row grid. The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs. Players choose columns by typing a number, and the board updates after each move until a win or draw..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error message you encountered is related to the use of the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces in Python. The specific error message is:

```
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error typically occurs when you try to run a Tkinter application in an environment that does not have access to a graphical display. This is common when running the application on a remote server or in a headless environment (an environment without a graphical user interface).

Here are the main points to consider regarding this error:

1. **Environment Issue**: The error indicates that the Tkinter library is unable to find a display to render the GUI. This is because the `$DISPLAY` environment variable, which is used by X11 to determine the display screen, is not set.

2. **Headless Environment**: If you are running this code on a server or in a Docker container without a graphical interface, you will encounter this error because there is no display available.

3. **Solution**:
   - If you are running the code on a local machine with a graphical interface, ensure that your environment is correctly set up to support GUI applications.
   - If you are running the code on a remote server or in a headless environment, consider using a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to emulate a display.
   - Alternatively, you can test the application on a local machine with a graphical interface to ensure that the GUI components work as expected.

In summary, the issue is not with the code itself but with the environment in which it is being executed. You need to ensure that the environment supports graphical display for Tkinter applications.

Error Summary of Test Reports:
"The error message you encountered is related to the use of the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces in Python. The specific error message is:

```
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error typically occurs when you try to run a Tkinter application in an environment that does not have access to a graphical display. This is common when running the application on a remote server or in a headless environment (an environment without a graphical user interface).

Here are the main points to consider regarding this error:

1. **Environment Issue**: The error indicates that the Tkinter library is unable to find a display to render the GUI. This is because the `$DISPLAY` environment variable, which is used by X11 to determine the display screen, is not set.

2. **Headless Environment**: If you are running this code on a server or in a Docker container without a graphical interface, you will encounter this error because there is no display available.

3. **Solution**:
   - If you are running the code on a local machine with a graphical interface, ensure that your environment is correctly set up to support GUI applications.
   - If you are running the code on a remote server or in a headless environment, consider using a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to emulate a display.
   - Alternatively, you can test the application on a local machine with a graphical interface to ensure that the GUI components work as expected.

In summary, the issue is not with the code itself but with the environment in which it is being executed. You need to ensure that the environment supports graphical display for Tkinter applications."
Note that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary. Now, use the format exemplified above and modify the problematic codes based on the error summary. Output the codes that you fixed based on the test reported and corresponding explanations (strictly follow the format defined above, including FILENAME, LANGUAGE, DOCSTRING and CODE; incomplete "TODO" codes are strictly prohibited).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Implement a standard Connect Four game. Two players alternate placing discs into a seven-column, six-row grid. The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs. Players choose columns by typing a number, and the board updates after each move until a win or draw..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error message you encountered is related to the use of the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces in Python. The specific error is:

```
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error typically occurs when you try to run a Tkinter-based application in an environment that does not have access to a graphical display. This is common when running the application on a server or a headless environment (an environment without a graphical user interface).

Here are the main points to consider regarding this error:

1. **Environment Issue**: The error indicates that the Tkinter library cannot find a display to render the GUI. This is because the `$DISPLAY` environment variable, which specifies the display server to use, is not set. This variable is usually set automatically in environments with a graphical user interface.

2. **Headless Environment**: If you are running this code on a server or a system without a GUI (such as a remote server accessed via SSH), you will encounter this error because there is no display available for Tkinter to use.

3. **Solution**:
   - **Run Locally**: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical user interface.
   - **Use a Virtual Display**: If you need to run the application on a server, you can use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to simulate a display environment. This allows Tkinter to render the GUI without an actual display.

To summarize, the issue is not with the code itself but with the environment in which it is being executed. You need to ensure that the environment has access to a graphical display or use a workaround like Xvfb to simulate one.

Error Summary of Test Reports:
"The error message you encountered is related to the use of the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces in Python. The specific error is:

```
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error typically occurs when you try to run a Tkinter-based application in an environment that does not have access to a graphical display. This is common when running the application on a server or a headless environment (an environment without a graphical user interface).

Here are the main points to consider regarding this error:

1. **Environment Issue**: The error indicates that the Tkinter library cannot find a display to render the GUI. This is because the `$DISPLAY` environment variable, which specifies the display server to use, is not set. This variable is usually set automatically in environments with a graphical user interface.

2. **Headless Environment**: If you are running this code on a server or a system without a GUI (such as a remote server accessed via SSH), you will encounter this error because there is no display available for Tkinter to use.

3. **Solution**:
   - **Run Locally**: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical user interface.
   - **Use a Virtual Display**: If you need to run the application on a server, you can use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to simulate a display environment. This allows Tkinter to render the GUI without an actual display.

To summarize, the issue is not with the code itself but with the environment in which it is being executed. You need to ensure that the environment has access to a graphical display or use a workaround like Xvfb to simulate one."
Note that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary. Now, use the format exemplified above and modify the problematic codes based on the error summary. Output the codes that you fixed based on the test reported and corresponding explanations (strictly follow the format defined above, including FILENAME, LANGUAGE, DOCSTRING and CODE; incomplete "TODO" codes are strictly prohibited). If no bugs are reported, please return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Implement a standard Connect Four game. Two players alternate placing discs into a seven-column, six-row grid. The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs. Players choose columns by typing a number, and the board updates after each move until a win or draw..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error message you encountered is a `TclError` related to the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces in Python. The specific error message is:

```
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error indicates that the Tkinter library is unable to find a display to render the GUI. This typically occurs in environments where there is no graphical display available, such as when running the code on a remote server or in a headless environment (e.g., a server without a graphical user interface).

Here are some potential solutions to address this issue:

1. **Ensure a Display Environment**: If you are running this code on a local machine with a graphical interface, make sure that your display environment is properly set up. If you are using a remote server, you might need to use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to simulate a display.

2. **Run Locally**: If possible, run the code on a local machine with a GUI environment where Tkinter can access the display.

3. **Use SSH with X11 Forwarding**: If you are accessing a remote server via SSH, you can enable X11 forwarding by using the `-X` option with the SSH command. This allows the GUI to be displayed on your local machine.

4. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure that the `$DISPLAY` environment variable is set correctly. This variable tells Tkinter where to render the GUI.

5. **Use a Different GUI Library**: If running in a headless environment is necessary and you cannot use a virtual display, consider using a different GUI library that supports headless operation or redesign the application to run in a command-line interface.

By addressing the display environment, you should be able to resolve the `TclError` and successfully run the Connect Four game with the Tkinter GUI.

Error Summary of Test Reports:
"The error message you encountered is a `TclError` related to the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces in Python. The specific error message is:

```
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error indicates that the Tkinter library is unable to find a display to render the GUI. This typically occurs in environments where there is no graphical display available, such as when running the code on a remote server or in a headless environment (e.g., a server without a graphical user interface).

Here are some potential solutions to address this issue:

1. **Ensure a Display Environment**: If you are running this code on a local machine with a graphical interface, make sure that your display environment is properly set up. If you are using a remote server, you might need to use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to simulate a display.

2. **Run Locally**: If possible, run the code on a local machine with a GUI environment where Tkinter can access the display.

3. **Use SSH with X11 Forwarding**: If you are accessing a remote server via SSH, you can enable X11 forwarding by using the `-X` option with the SSH command. This allows the GUI to be displayed on your local machine.

4. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure that the `$DISPLAY` environment variable is set correctly. This variable tells Tkinter where to render the GUI.

5. **Use a Different GUI Library**: If running in a headless environment is necessary and you cannot use a virtual display, consider using a different GUI library that supports headless operation or redesign the application to run in a command-line interface.

By addressing the display environment, you should be able to resolve the `TclError` and successfully run the Connect Four game with the Tkinter GUI."

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code, the Connect Four game application uses the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface. `tkinter` is a standard library in Python and does not need to be included in the `requirements.txt` file. However, if there are any other dependencies or packages used in the project that are not part of the standard library, they should be listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Since no additional packages are mentioned in the provided code, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty or not needed for this project. However, if you plan to extend the project with additional libraries, you can add them to the `requirements.txt` file.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file for the current project:

```
# No additional packages required beyond the standard library
```

If you decide to add more features or use additional libraries in the future, you can update this file accordingly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, the Connect Four game application uses the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface. `tkinter` is a standard library in Python and does not need to be included in the `requirements.txt` file. However, if there are any other dependencies or packages used in the project that are not part of the standard library, they should be listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Since no additional packages are mentioned in the provided code, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty or not needed for this project. However, if you plan to extend the project with additional libraries, you can add them to the `requirements.txt` file.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file for the current project:
```
# No additional packages required beyond the standard library
```
If you decide to add more features or use additional libraries in the future, you can update this file accordingly. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I understand the importance of ensuring that our project is well-documented and easy to set up for future development or deployment. Based on the provided information and the Programmer's assessment, the current Connect Four game application does not require any external packages beyond Python's standard library, specifically `tkinter`, which is included by default.

Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project will be minimal, reflecting the absence of additional dependencies. Here is the content of the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No additional packages required beyond the standard library
```

This file serves as a placeholder and can be updated in the future if the project is extended with additional libraries or features that require external packages. This approach ensures clarity and ease of maintenance for anyone who might work on the project later.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Connect Four Game User Manual

Welcome to the Connect Four Game! This manual will guide you through the installation, setup, and usage of the Connect Four game application developed using Python and Tkinter.

## Introduction

Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

## Main Functions

- **Game Logic**: The game logic is implemented to handle player turns, check for a win or draw condition, and manage the game board state.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: The GUI is built using Tkinter, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for players to play the game.

## Installation

### Environment Setup

The Connect Four game requires Python to be installed on your system. It uses the Tkinter library, which is included in the standard Python distribution. No additional packages are required.

1. **Install Python**: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Verify Tkinter Installation**: Tkinter is included with Python, but you can verify its installation by running the following command in your Python environment:

   ```bash
   python -m tkinter
   ```

   If a small window appears, Tkinter is installed correctly.

### Running the Game

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository containing the game code to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the game files are located.

3. **Run the Game**: Execute the following command to start the game:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Launch the game by running `main.py`. A window titled "Connect Four" will appear.

2. **Game Interface**: The interface consists of a grid representing the game board and buttons at the top for each column.

3. **Make a Move**: Players take turns clicking the "Drop" button corresponding to the column where they want to drop their disc. The discs will fall to the lowest available position in the selected column.

4. **Winning the Game**: The game checks for a win condition after each move. A player wins by forming a line of four discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

5. **Draw Condition**: If the board is filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

6. **Game Over**: When a player wins or the game ends in a draw, a message box will display the result. The game can be restarted by closing and reopening the application.

## Support
