# Sort Even Indices Software

This software provides a simple utility function to sort elements at even indices of a list while keeping the elements at odd indices unchanged. It is implemented in Python and does not require any external dependencies.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `sort_even(l: list)`. This function takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list where:
- The elements at even indices are sorted in ascending order.
- The elements at odd indices remain in their original positions.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(sort_even([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
    print(sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]))  # Output: [3, 6, 5, 4]
```
