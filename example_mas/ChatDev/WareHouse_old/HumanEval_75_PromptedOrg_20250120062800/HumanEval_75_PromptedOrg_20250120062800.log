Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and testing a piece of software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to focus on the functionality and logic of the code without the need for additional presentation formats. What are your thoughts on this?

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `is_multiply_prime(a)` that checks if a given number `a` is the product of exactly three prime numbers. Since the number `a` is less than 100, we can use a simple approach to check for prime numbers and their combinations.

### Core Functions and Purpose:

1. **is_prime(n)**: A helper function to determine if a number `n` is a prime number.
2. **is_multiply_prime(a)**: The main function that checks if the number `a` is the product of exactly three prime numbers.

Now, let's implement the code in a single file named `main.py`.

FILENAME

```python

'''

This module contains a function to check if a given number is the product of exactly three prime numbers.

'''

def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is a prime number."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def is_multiply_prime(a):
    """Return True if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers and False otherwise."""
    primes = [i for i in range(2, 100) if is_prime(i)]
    
    # Check combinations of three primes
    for i in range(len(primes)):
        for j in range(i, len(primes)):
            for k in range(j, len(primes)):
                if primes[i] * primes[j] * primes[k] == a:
                    return True
    return False

```

This code defines a helper function `is_prime` to determine if a number is prime and uses it within `is_multiply_prime` to check combinations of three prime numbers whose product equals the input number `a`. The function returns `True` if such a combination exists and `False` otherwise.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Based on the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages used that would require specification in a `requirements.txt` file. The code only uses Python's built-in functions and libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed for this particular project. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any external Python packages.

"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages used that would require specification in a `requirements.txt` file. The code only uses Python's built-in functions and libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed for this particular project. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

# Prime Multiplication Checker

This software provides a function to determine if a given number is the product of exactly three prime numbers. It is designed to work with numbers less than 100.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `is_multiply_prime(a)`. This function checks if the input number `a` is the product of exactly three prime numbers. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Example

```python
is_multiply_prime(30)  # Returns: True, because 30 = 2 * 3 * 5
is_multiply_prime(28)  # Returns: False, because 28 is not the product of three prime numbers
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it simple to set up and use. You only need Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file to your local machine.

## How to Use

1. Open the `main.py` file in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.

2. You can directly call the `is_multiply_prime(a)` function with the desired integer `a` to check if it is the product of three prime numbers.

3. Run the script to see the results.

### Example Usage

```python
# Import the function from the module
from main import is_multiply_prime

# Test the function with a number
result = is_multiply_prime(30)
print(result)  # Output: True

result = is_multiply_prime(28)
print(result)  # Output: False
```

## Documentation

The function `is_multiply_prime(a)` is designed to be straightforward and easy to use. It leverages a helper function `is_prime(n)` to determine if a number is prime and checks combinations of prime numbers to verify if the input number is a product of exactly three primes.
