Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and executing a Python function to solve a specific problem, I believe the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This would allow us to implement the necessary code and provide a functional tool for the user. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" is indeed the most appropriate modality for this task, as it involves coding and execution of a Python function. This will allow us to deliver a functional solution to the customer.

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To address the customer's task, we need to implement a function `select_words` that processes a given string and returns a list of words containing exactly `n` consonants. Since the task specifies not to implement a GUI, we will focus solely on the logic required for this function.

Here is the plan:

1. **Function `select_words(s, n)`**: This function will:
   - Split the input string `s` into words.
   - Count the consonants in each word.
   - Return a list of words that have exactly `n` consonants.

Now, let's write the code for this function in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python

'''

Given a string s and a natural number n, implement a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s. If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list. Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.

'''

def select_words(s, n):
    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
    words = s.split()
    result = []
    
    for word in words:
        consonant_count = sum(1 for char in word if char.isalpha() and char not in vowels)
        if consonant_count == n:
            result.append(word)
    
    return result

```

This code defines the `select_words` function, which processes the input string `s` to find and return words with exactly `n` consonants. The function uses a set of vowels to differentiate consonants and counts them for each word. If a word has the required number of consonants, it is added to the result list.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            
def select_words(s, n):
    """Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement 
    a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly 
    n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
    Examples:
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
    select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []
    select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
    select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]
    """
.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The function `select_words` relies solely on Python's built-in functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no additional dependencies required.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

If you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can simply leave it empty or include a comment indicating that no external packages are needed.

Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            
def select_words(s, n):
    """Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement 
    a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly 
    n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
    Examples:
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
    select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []
    select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
    select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]
    """
.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

As the Chief Executive Officer, I concur with the Programmer's assessment. The provided code in `main.py` does not utilize any external libraries or packages, as it relies entirely on Python's built-in capabilities. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would indeed be empty, as there are no additional dependencies required.

For completeness and clarity, here is how the `requirements.txt` file should look:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

This comment serves as a clear indication that the project does not require any external packages to function properly. If there are any future changes or additions to the code that introduce dependencies, the `requirements.txt` file should be updated accordingly.

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Select Words by Consonant Count

This software provides a utility function to extract words from a given string based on the number of consonants they contain. It is designed to be simple and efficient, with no external dependencies required.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `select_words(s, n)`. This function takes two parameters:
- `s`: A string containing words separated by spaces.
- `n`: A natural number representing the exact number of consonants a word must have to be included in the result.

The function returns a list of words from the string `s` that contain exactly `n` consonants, preserving the order in which they appear in the string. If the input string `s` is empty, the function returns an empty list.

### Examples

- `select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4)` returns `["little"]`
- `select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3)` returns `["Mary", "lamb"]`
- `select_words("simple white space", 2)` returns `[]`
- `select_words("Hello world", 4)` returns `["world"]`
- `select_words("Uncle sam", 3)` returns `["Uncle"]`

## Installation

This software does not require any external libraries or dependencies. It is implemented in pure Python, and you can use it directly in your Python environment.

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change your directory to the cloned repository:
   ```
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Run the Code**: You can use the function directly in your Python scripts or interactive environment. Simply import the function and call it with the desired parameters.

## Usage

To use the `select_words` function, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Function**: Ensure that the `select_words` function is accessible in your Python environment. You can do this by placing the `main.py` file in your working directory or by importing it from the module where it is defined.

2. **Call the Function**: Use the function by passing a string and a natural number as arguments. For example:
   ```python
   from main import select_words

   result = select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4)
   print(result)  # Output: ["little"]
   ```

3. **Interpret the Results**: The function will return a list of words that match the specified number of consonants.

## Documentation

For further details on the implementation and usage examples, refer to the comments within the `main.py` file. The function is designed to be intuitive and straightforward, making it easy to integrate into larger projects or use as a standalone utility.
