# Fibonacci Number Calculator

This software provides a simple function to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It is implemented in Python and designed to be straightforward and efficient.

## Main Functionality

The main functionality of this software is to compute the n-th Fibonacci number using an iterative approach. The function `fib(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the n-th Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1.

### Example Usage

- `fib(10)` returns `55`
- `fib(1)` returns `1`
- `fib(8)` returns `21`

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Quick Install

Since there are no external dependencies required for this software, you can directly use the Python script without any additional installations. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**

   Change into the directory where the `main.py` file is located:

   ```bash
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Run the Script**

   You can run the script using Python to calculate the Fibonacci number for a given `n`. For example:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   You can modify the `main.py` file to call the `fib(n)` function with your desired input.

4. **Modify the Code**

   If you want to calculate the Fibonacci number for a different value of `n`, you can modify the call to `fib(n)` in the `main.py` file.

## Documentation

The function `fib(n)` is documented with docstrings, providing examples of how to use it. You can view these examples by inspecting the function in the `main.py` file.
