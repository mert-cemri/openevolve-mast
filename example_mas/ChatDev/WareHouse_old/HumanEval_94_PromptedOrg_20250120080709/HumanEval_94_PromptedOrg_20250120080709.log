As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To solve the task, we need to implement a function that finds the largest prime number in a list of integers and returns the sum of its digits. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Check for Prime Numbers**: We need a helper function to determine if a number is prime.
2. **Find the Largest Prime**: Iterate through the list to find the largest prime number.
3. **Sum the Digits**: Once the largest prime is found, calculate the sum of its digits.

Now, let's implement this in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This script defines a function `skjkasdkd` that takes a list of integers as input,
finds the largest prime number in the list, and returns the sum of its digits.

    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def sum_of_digits(n):

def skjkasdkd(lst):
    """Find the largest prime in the list and return the sum of its digits."""
    largest_prime = None
    for number in lst:
        if is_prime(number):
            if largest_prime is None or number > largest_prime:
                largest_prime = number
    if largest_prime is not None:
        return sum_of_digits(largest_prime)
    return 0  # Return 0 if no prime number is found

# Example usage:
# print(skjkasdkd([0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3]))  # Output: 10

This code defines the necessary functions to solve the task. It includes a helper function `is_prime` to check for prime numbers, a function `sum_of_digits` to calculate the sum of digits, and the main function `skjkasdkd` that ties everything together.

[2025-20-01 08:07:23 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 To solve the task, we need to implement a function that finds the largest prime number in a list of integers and returns the sum of its digits. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Check for Prime Numbers**: We need a helper function to determine if a number is prime.
2. **Find the Largest Prime**: Iterate through the list to find the largest prime number.
3. **Sum the Digits**: Once the largest prime is found, calculate the sum of its digits.

Now, let's implement this in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This script defines a function `skjkasdkd` that takes a list of integers as input,
finds the largest prime number in the list, and returns the sum of its digits.

'''

def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def sum_of_digits(n):
    """Return the sum of the digits of a number."""
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

def skjkasdkd(lst):
    """Find the largest prime in the list and return the sum of its digits."""
    largest_prime = None
    for number in lst:
        if is_prime(number):
            if largest_prime is None or number > largest_prime:
                largest_prime = number
    if largest_prime is not None:
        return sum_of_digits(largest_prime)
    return 0  # Return 0 if no prime number is found

# Example usage:
# print(skjkasdkd([0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3]))  # Output: 10
# print(skjkasdkd([1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1]))  # Output: 25
# print(skjkasdkd([1,3,1,32,5107,34,83278,109,163,23,2323,32,30,1,9,3]))  # Output: 13
# print(skjkasdkd([0,724,32,71,99,32,6,0,5,91,83,0,5,6]))  # Output: 11
# print(skjkasdkd([0,81,12,3,1,21]))  # Output: 3

This code defines the necessary functions to solve the task. It includes a helper function `is_prime` to check for prime numbers, a function `sum_of_digits` to calculate the sum of digits, and the main function `skjkasdkd` that ties everything together.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: The provided code does not use any external libraries or packages; it only uses built-in Python functions and constructs. Therefore, there are no additional dependencies required for this project. As a result, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, to maintain the standard format, you can include a comment indicating that no external packages are needed.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external packages required for this project
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha
