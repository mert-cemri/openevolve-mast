# Gold Miner Game

Welcome to the Gold Miner Game, a fun and engaging game where you control a claw to collect gold and other valuable objects. The game challenges your timing and strategy skills as you aim to meet the minimum gold value before time runs out.

## Main Functions

- **Claw Control**: The claw moves back and forth across the screen. You must time your grab to collect objects.
- **Object Collection**: Each object has a specific value and weight, affecting how quickly it can be reeled in.
- **Score and Timer**: The game tracks your score and the remaining time. The level ends when you meet the target score or time runs out.
- **User Interface**: Displays the current score and remaining time on the screen.

## Installation

To play the Gold Miner Game, you need to have Python and the Pygame library installed on your system. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:
