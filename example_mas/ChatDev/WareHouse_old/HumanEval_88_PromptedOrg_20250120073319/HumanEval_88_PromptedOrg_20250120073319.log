To complete the task, we need to implement a function `sort_array` that sorts an array of non-negative integers based on the sum of the first and last elements. If the sum is odd, the array should be sorted in ascending order; if even, in descending order. The function should return a new sorted array without modifying the original array.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Name**: `sort_array`
   - **Purpose**: To sort an array based on the sum of its first and last elements.
   
2. **Logic**:
   - Check if the array is empty or has only one element, in which case return the array as is.
   - Calculate the sum of the first and last elements of the array.
   - If the sum is odd, return a sorted copy of the array in ascending order.
   - If the sum is even, return a sorted copy of the array in descending order.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

Given an array of non-negative integers, return a copy of the given array after sorting.
You will sort the given array in ascending order if the sum of the first index value and last index value is odd,
or sort it in descending order if the sum is even.

Note:
* Don't change the given array.

Examples:
* sort_array([]) => []
* sort_array([5]) => [5]
* sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5]) => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
* sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6]) => [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]

'''

def sort_array(array):
    if len(array) == 0 or len(array) == 1:
        return array.copy()
    
    sum_first_last = array[0] + array[-1]
    
    if sum_first_last % 2 == 1:
        return sorted(array)
    else:
        return sorted(array, reverse=True)

```

This code defines the `sort_array` function, which checks the length of the array, calculates the sum of the first and last elements, and sorts the array accordingly. The function returns a new sorted array without modifying the original one.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses built-in Python functions and data structures. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any external Python packages.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses built-in Python functions and data structures. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that the project does not rely on any external Python packages. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

The Programmer's assessment is correct. The provided code for the `sort_array` function only utilizes built-in Python functions and data structures, meaning there are no external dependencies required for this project. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would indeed be empty. However, for completeness and to adhere to standard practices, you can include a `requirements.txt` file with a comment indicating that no external dependencies are needed. Here is how it would look:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This file serves as a placeholder and communicates to anyone reviewing the project that no additional Python packages are necessary for the code to function as intended.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            
def sort_array(array):
    """
    Given an array of non-negative integers, return a copy of the given array after sorting,
    you will sort the given array in ascending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is odd,
    or sort it in descending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is even.

    Note:
    * don't change the given array.

    Examples:
    * sort_array([]) => []
    * sort_array([5]) => [5]
    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5]) => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    """
.
To complete the task, you will provide strategic guidance and instructions to your team, ensuring that the solution meets the customer's needs and aligns with the company's objectives.]

# Sort Array Application

This application provides a function to sort an array of non-negative integers based on specific criteria. The sorting order is determined by the sum of the first and last elements of the array.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this application is `sort_array(array)`. This function takes an array of non-negative integers and returns a sorted copy of the array based on the following rules:

- If the sum of the first and last elements of the array is odd, the array is sorted in ascending order.
- If the sum is even, the array is sorted in descending order.
- The original array is not modified.

### Examples

- `sort_array([])` returns `[]`
- `sort_array([5])` returns `[5]`
- `sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5])` returns `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- `sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6])` returns `[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]`

## Installation

This application does not require any external dependencies. You can use it directly with Python.

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**

   ```

3. **Run the Application:**

   You can run the application using Python:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
