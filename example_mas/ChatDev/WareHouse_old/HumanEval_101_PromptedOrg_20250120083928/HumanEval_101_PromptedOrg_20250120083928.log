To solve the task, we need to implement a function `words_string` that takes a string as input and returns a list of words. The words in the input string can be separated by commas or spaces. We will use Python's built-in string methods to achieve this.

Here's the plan:

1. **Function Name**: `words_string`
   - **Purpose**: To split a given string into words based on spaces and commas and return a list of words.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains the function `words_string` which splits a given string into words
based on spaces and commas and returns a list of words.

'''

def words_string(s):
    """
    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
    
    For example:
    words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
    """
    # Replace commas with spaces to unify the separators
    s = s.replace(',', ' ')
    # Split the string by spaces and filter out any empty strings
    words = [word for word in s.split() if word]
    return words
```

This code defines the `words_string` function, which processes the input string by replacing commas with spaces, then splits the string by spaces, and finally filters out any empty strings that might result from consecutive spaces. The function returns a list of words as required.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `words_string` only uses built-in Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, as there are no additional packages needed for the project to run properly.
Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:
```
# No external dependencies required
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Words String Splitter

This software module provides a simple function to split a given string of words separated by commas or spaces into an array of individual words. It is designed to be straightforward and efficient, requiring no external dependencies.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this module is encapsulated in the `words_string` function. This function takes a single string input and returns a list of words. The input string can contain words separated by either commas or spaces, and the function will handle both separators seamlessly.

### Function Definition

```python
def words_string(s):
    """
    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
    
    For example:
    words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
    """
    # Replace commas with spaces to unify the separators
    s = s.replace(',', ' ')
    # Split the string by spaces and filter out any empty strings
    words = [word for word in s.split() if word]
    return words
```

## Installation

This module does not require any external libraries or dependencies, making it easy to integrate into any Python project. Simply include the `main.py` file in your project directory.

## Usage

To use the `words_string` function, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the `main.py` file is in your project directory.
2. Import the function into your Python script:

    ```python
    from main import words_string
    ```

3. Call the function with a string input:

    ```python
    result = words_string("Hi, my name is John")
    print(result)  # Output: ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    ```

4. The function will return a list of words extracted from the input string.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the `words_string` function:

```python
from main import words_string

# Example input
input_string = "One, two, three, four, five, six"

 # Words String Splitter

This software module provides a simple function to split a given string of words separated by commas or spaces into an array of individual words. It is designed to be straightforward and efficient, requiring no external dependencies.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this module is encapsulated in the `words_string` function. This function takes a single string input and returns a list of words. The input string can contain words separated by either commas or spaces, and the function will handle both separators seamlessly.

### Function Definition

```python
def words_string(s):
    """
    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
    
    For example:
    words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
    """
    # Replace commas with spaces to unify the separators
    s = s.replace(',', ' ')
    # Split the string by spaces and filter out any empty strings
    words = [word for word in s.split() if word]
    return words
```

## Installation

This module does not require any external libraries or dependencies, making it easy to integrate into any Python project. Simply include the `main.py` file in your project directory.

## Usage

To use the `words_string` function, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the `main.py` file is in your project directory.
2. Import the function into your Python script:

    ```python
    from main import words_string
    ```

3. Call the function with a string input:

    ```python
    result = words_string("Hi, my name is John")
    print(result)  # Output: ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    ```

4. The function will return a list of words extracted from the input string.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the `words_string` function:

```python
from main import words_string

# Example input
input_string = "One, two, three, four, five, six"

# Get the list of words
words_list = words_string(input_string)

# Output the result
print(words_list)  # Output: ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
```

## Conclusion

The Words String Splitter module is a simple yet effective tool for processing strings of words separated by commas or spaces. With no external dependencies, it is easy to use and integrate into any Python project.
