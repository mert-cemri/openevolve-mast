You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The highest priority comment is regarding the accessibility and responsiveness of the navigation menu. While the CSS includes a media query for smaller screens, the navigation menu should also be enhanced for better mobile accessibility by implementing a hamburger menu for smaller screens.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
1. Implement a JavaScript-based hamburger menu for screens with a width of 768px or less.
2. Update the CSS to hide the navigation links by default on smaller screens and display them when the hamburger menu is clicked.

Here's a basic example of how you can implement this:

**CSS Update:**
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    nav ul {
        display: none;
        flex-direction: column;
    }
    nav.active ul {
        display: flex;
    }
    .hamburger {
        display: block;
        cursor: pointer;
    }
}
```

**HTML Update:**
```html
<header>
    <nav>
        <div class="hamburger">☰</div>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#admissions">Admissions</a></li>
            <li><a href="#academics">Academics</a></li>
            <li><a href="#research">Research</a></li>
            <li><a href="#news">News & Events</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
</header>
```

**JavaScript Update (script.js):**
```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const hamburger = document.querySelector('.hamburger');
    const nav = document.querySelector('nav');
    hamburger.addEventListener('click', function() {
        nav.classList.toggle('active');
    });

    // Existing code for dynamic content loading
    const newsSection = document.getElementById('news');
    fetchNews().then(news => {
        newsSection.innerHTML += news.map(item => `<p>${item}</p>`).join('');
    });
});
```

This will ensure that the navigation menu is accessible and user-friendly on mobile devices, aligning with the task requirements for a responsive and accessible design.

 The highest priority comment is regarding the accessibility and responsiveness of the navigation menu. While the CSS includes a media query for smaller screens, the navigation menu should also be enhanced for better mobile accessibility by implementing a hamburger menu for smaller screens.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
1. Implement a JavaScript-based hamburger menu for screens with a width of 768px or less.
2. Update the CSS to hide the navigation links by default on smaller screens and display them when the hamburger menu is clicked.

Here's a basic example of how you can implement this:

        display: flex;
    }
    .hamburger {
        display: block;
        cursor: pointer;
    }
}
```

**HTML Update:**
```html
<header>
    <nav>
        <div class="hamburger">☰</div>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#admissions">Admissions</a></li>
            <li><a href="#academics">Academics</a></li>
            <li><a href="#research">Research</a></li>
            <li><a href="#news">News & Events</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
</header>
```

**JavaScript Update (script.js):**
```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const hamburger = document.querySelector('.hamburger');
    const nav = document.querySelector('nav');
    hamburger.addEventListener('click', function() {
        nav.classList.toggle('active');
    });

    // Existing code for dynamic content loading
    const newsSection = document.getElementById('news');
    fetchNews().then(news => {
        newsSection.innerHTML += news.map(item => `<p>${item}</p>`).join('');
    });
});
```

This will ensure that the navigation menu is accessible and user-friendly on mobile devices, aligning with the task requirements for a responsive and accessible design.

Comments on Codes:
"The highest priority comment is regarding the accessibility and responsiveness of the navigation menu. While the CSS includes a media query for smaller screens, the navigation menu should also be enhanced for better mobile accessibility by implementing a hamburger menu for smaller screens.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
1. Implement a JavaScript-based hamburger menu for screens with a width of 768px or less.
2. Update the CSS to hide the navigation links by default on smaller screens and display them when the hamburger menu is clicked.

Here's a basic example of how you can implement this:

**CSS Update:**
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    nav ul {
        display: none;
        flex-direction: column;
    }
    nav.active ul {
        display: flex;
    }
    .hamburger {
        display: block;
        cursor: pointer;
    }
}
```

**HTML Update:**
```html
<header>
    <nav>
        <div class="hamburger">☰</div>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#admissions">Admissions</a></li>
            <li><a href="#academics">Academics</a></li>
            <li><a href="#research">Research</a></li>
            <li><a href="#news">News & Events</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
</header>
```

**JavaScript Update (script.js):**
```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const hamburger = document.querySelector('.hamburger');
    const nav = document.querySelector('nav');
    hamburger.addEventListener('click', function() {
        nav.classList.toggle('active');
    });

    // Existing code for dynamic content loading
    const newsSection = document.getElementById('news');
    fetchNews().then(news => {
        newsSection.innerHTML += news.map(item => `<p>${item}</p>`).join('');
    });
});
```

This will ensure that the navigation menu is accessible and user-friendly on mobile devices, aligning with the task requirements for a responsive and accessible design."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Update the CSS to hide the navigation links by default on smaller screens and display them when the hamburger menu is clicked.\n\nHere\'s a basic example of how you can implement this:\n\nCSS Update:\ncss\n@media (max-width: 768px) {\n    nav ul {\n        display: none;\n        flex-direction: column;\n    }\n    nav.active ul {\n        display: flex;\n    }\n    .hamburger {\n        display: block;\n        cursor: pointer;\n    }\n}\n\n\nHTML Update:\nhtml\n&lt;header&gt;\n    &lt;nav&gt;\n        &lt;div class="hamburger"&gt;☰&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;ul&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#admissions"&gt;Admissions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#academics"&gt;Academics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#research"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#news"&gt;News &amp; Events&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;/nav&gt;\n&lt;/header&gt;\n\n\nJavaScript Update (script.js):*\njs\ndocument.addEventListener(\'DOMContentLoaded\', function() {\n    const hamburger = document.querySelector(\'.hamburger\');\n    const nav = document.querySelector(\'nav\');\n    hamburger.addEventListener(\'click\', function() {\n        nav.classList.toggle(\'active\');\n    });\n\n    // Existing code for dynamic content loading\n    const newsSection = document.getElementById(\'news\');\n    fetchNews().then(news =&gt; {\n        newsSection.innerHTML += news.map(item =&gt; `&lt;p&gt;${item}&lt;/p&gt;`).join(\'\');\n    });\n});\n\n\nThis will ensure that the navigation menu is accessible and user-friendly on mobile devices, aligning with the task requirements for a responsive and accessible design.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Ensure accessibility and mobile-friendly design..

The highest priority comment is regarding the accessibility and mobile-friendly design. While the code includes some accessibility features, it lacks comprehensive ARIA labels and roles for better screen reader support. Additionally, the mobile navigation could be improved for better usability.

**Suggestions for Revision:**
1. **Enhance Accessibility:**
   - Add `aria-label` attributes to the navigation links for better screen reader support.
   - Ensure all interactive elements have keyboard focus styles for better visibility.

2. **Improve Mobile Navigation:**
   - Consider adding a close button for the mobile menu to improve user experience.
   - Ensure the hamburger menu is accessible via keyboard navigation.

Here's an example of how you can enhance the accessibility and mobile navigation:

```html
<nav aria-label="Main Navigation">
    <div class="hamburger" aria-label="Toggle navigation menu" tabindex="0">☰</div>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#admissions" aria-label="Admissions Section">Admissions</a></li>
        <li><a href="#academics" aria-label="Academics Section">Academics</a></li>
        <li><a href="#research" aria-label="Research Section">Research</a></li>
        <li><a href="#news" aria-label="News and Events Section">News & Events</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
```

In `script.js`, ensure the hamburger menu can be toggled using the keyboard:

```js
hamburger.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'Enter' || event.key === ' ') {
        nav.classList.toggle('active');
    }
});
```

Implement these changes to enhance the accessibility and usability of the website.

Comments on Codes:
"The highest priority comment is regarding the accessibility and mobile-friendly design. While the code includes some accessibility features, it lacks comprehensive ARIA labels and roles for better screen reader support. Additionally, the mobile navigation could be improved for better usability.

**Suggestions for Revision:**
1. **Enhance Accessibility:**
   - Add `aria-label` attributes to the navigation links for better screen reader support.
   - Ensure all interactive elements have keyboard focus styles for better visibility.

2. **Improve Mobile Navigation:**
   - Consider adding a close button for the mobile menu to improve user experience.
   - Ensure the hamburger menu is accessible via keyboard navigation.

Here's an example of how you can enhance the accessibility and mobile navigation:

```html
<nav aria-label="Main Navigation">
    <div class="hamburger" aria-label="Toggle navigation menu" tabindex="0">☰</div>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#admissions" aria-label="Admissions Section">Admissions</a></li>
        <li><a href="#academics" aria-label="Academics Section">Academics</a></li>
        <li><a href="#research" aria-label="Research Section">Research</a></li>
        <li><a href="#news" aria-label="News and Events Section">News & Events</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
```

In `script.js`, ensure the hamburger menu can be toggled using the keyboard:

```js
hamburger.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'Enter' || event.key === ' ') {
        nav.classList.toggle('active');
    }
});
```

Implement these changes to enhance the accessibility and usability of the website."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Ensure accessibility and mobile-friendly design..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The highest priority comment is regarding the accessibility and mobile-friendly design, specifically the hamburger menu functionality and its accessibility features. While the hamburger menu is implemented, the code does not ensure that the menu can be navigated using the keyboard once it is expanded. This is crucial for accessibility.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
1. Ensure that when the hamburger menu is activated (expanded), the focus can move to the menu items using the keyboard (Tab key). This can be done by setting the `tabindex` attribute on the menu items when the menu is active.
2. Consider adding ARIA attributes to indicate the state of the menu (expanded/collapsed) for screen readers. For example, use `aria-expanded` on the hamburger button to reflect the current state.

Here's a sample modification to the `script.js`:

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const hamburger = document.querySelector('.hamburger');
    const nav = document.querySelector('nav');
    const menuItems = nav.querySelectorAll('ul li a');
    
    hamburger.addEventListener('click', function() {
        const isActive = nav.classList.toggle('active');
        hamburger.setAttribute('aria-expanded', isActive);
        if (isActive) {
            menuItems.forEach(item => item.setAttribute('tabindex', '0'));
        } else {
            menuItems.forEach(item => item.setAttribute('tabindex', '-1'));
        }
    });

    hamburger.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
        if (event.key === 'Enter' || event.key === ' ') {
            const isActive = nav.classList.toggle('active');
            hamburger.setAttribute('aria-expanded', isActive);
            if (isActive) {
                menuItems.forEach(item => item.setAttribute('tabindex', '0'));
            } else {
                menuItems.forEach(item => item.setAttribute('tabindex', '-1'));
            }
        }
    });

    // Example of dynamic content loading
    const newsSection = document.getElementById('news');
    fetchNews().then(news => {
        newsSection.innerHTML += news.map(item => `<p>${item}</p>`).join('');
    });
});
```

This ensures that the menu items are focusable when the menu is expanded, improving accessibility for keyboard users.

    const newsSection = document.getElementById('news');
    fetchNews().then(news => {
        newsSection.innerHTML += news.map(item => `<p>${item}</p>`).join('');
    });
});
```

This ensures that the menu items are focusable when the menu is expanded, improving accessibility for keyboard users.

While the hamburger menu is implemented, the code does not ensure that the menu can be navigated using the keyboard once it is expanded. This is crucial for accessibility.\n\nSuggestion for Revision:*\n1. Ensure that when the hamburger menu is activated (expanded), the focus can move to the menu items using the keyboard (Tab key). This can be done by setting the tabindex attribute on the menu items when the menu is active.\n2. Consider adding ARIA attributes to indicate the state of the menu (expanded/collapsed) for screen readers. For example, use aria-expanded on the hamburger button to reflect the current state.\n\nHere's a sample modification to the script.js:\n\njs\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n    const hamburger = document.querySelector('.hamburger');\n    const nav = document.querySelector('nav');\n    const menuItems = nav.querySelectorAll('ul li a');\n    \n    hamburger.addEventListener('click', function() {\n        const isActive = nav.classList.toggle('active');\n        hamburger.setAttribute('aria-expanded', isActive);\n        if (isActive) {\n            menuItems.forEach(item =&gt; item.setAttribute('tabindex', '0'));\n        } else {\n            menuItems.forEach(item =&gt; item.setAttribute('tabindex', '-1'));\n        }\n    });\n\n    hamburger.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {\n        if (event.key === 'Enter' || event.key === ' ') {\n            const isActive = nav.classList.toggle('active');\n            hamburger.setAttribute('aria-expanded', isActive);\n            if (isActive) {\n                menuItems.forEach(item =&gt; item.setAttribute('tabindex', '0'));\n            } else {\n                menuItems.forEach(item =&gt; item.setAttribute('tabindex', '-1'));\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    // Example of dynamic content loading\n    const newsSection = document.getElementById('news');\n    fetchNews().then(news =&gt; {\n        newsSection.innerHTML += news.map(item =&gt; `&lt;p&gt;${item}&lt;/p&gt;`).join('');\n    });\n});\n\n\nThis ensures that the menu items are focusable when the menu is expanded, improving accessibility for keyboard users."} |

Comments on Codes:
"The highest priority comment is regarding the accessibility and mobile-friendly design, specifically the hamburger menu functionality and its accessibility features. While the hamburger menu is implemented, the code does not ensure that the menu can be navigated using the keyboard once it is expanded. This is crucial for accessibility.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
1. Ensure that when the hamburger menu is activated (expanded), the focus can move to the menu items using the keyboard (Tab key). This can be done by setting the `tabindex` attribute on the menu items when the menu is active.
2. Consider adding ARIA attributes to indicate the state of the menu (expanded/collapsed) for screen readers. For example, use `aria-expanded` on the hamburger button to reflect the current state.

Here's a sample modification to the `script.js`:

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const hamburger = document.querySelector('.hamburger');
    const nav = document.querySelector('nav');
    const menuItems = nav.querySelectorAll('ul li a');
    
    hamburger.addEventListener('click', function() {
        const isActive = nav.classList.toggle('active');
        hamburger.setAttribute('aria-expanded', isActive);
        if (isActive) {
            menuItems.forEach(item => item.setAttribute('tabindex', '0'));
        } else {
            menuItems.forEach(item => item.setAttribute('tabindex', '-1'));
        }
    });

    hamburger.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
        if (event.key === 'Enter' || event.key === ' ') {
            const isActive = nav.classList.toggle('active');
            hamburger.setAttribute('aria-expanded', isActive);
            if (isActive) {
                menuItems.forEach(item => item.setAttribute('tabindex', '0'));
            } else {
                menuItems.forEach(item => item.setAttribute('tabindex', '-1'));
            }
        }
    });

    // Example of dynamic content loading
    const newsSection = document.getElementById('news');
    fetchNews().then(news => {
        newsSection.innerHTML += news.map(item => `<p>${item}</p>`).join('');
    });
});
```

This ensures that the menu items are focusable when the menu is expanded, improving accessibility for keyboard users."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

For the given project, which primarily involves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, a `requirements.txt` file is not typically necessary, as this file format is used for Python projects to specify Python package dependencies. However, if the project were to include a backend component using Python, or if you were using a JavaScript package manager like npm, you might specify dependencies in a `package.json` file instead.

Since the project is a front-end web development project, there are no Python dependencies to list in a `requirements.txt` file. If you were to use any JavaScript libraries or frameworks, you would list those in a `package.json` file using npm. 

If you need to include any specific JavaScript libraries or tools, you might consider using a `package.json` file. Here's an example of what a `package.json` might look like if you were using npm:

```json
{
  "name": "uc-berkeley-landing-page",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A modern, responsive landing page for UC Berkeley.",
  "main": "index.html",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "live-server"
  },
  "author": "ChatDev",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "live-server": "^1.2.1"
  }
}
```

In this example, `live-server` is included as a dependency to serve the website locally for development purposes. Adjust the dependencies as needed based on the actual libraries or tools you use in your project.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given project, which primarily involves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, a `requirements.txt` file is not typically necessary, as this file format is used for Python projects to specify Python package dependencies. However, if the project were to include a backend component using Python, or if you were using a JavaScript package manager like npm, you might specify dependencies in a `package.json` file instead.
Since the project is a front-end web development project, there are no Python dependencies to list in a `requirements.txt` file. If you were to use any JavaScript libraries or frameworks, you would list those in a `package.json` file using npm. 
If you need to include any specific JavaScript libraries or tools, you might consider using a `package.json` file. Here's an example of what a `package.json` might look like if you were using npm:
```json
{
  "name": "uc-berkeley-landing-page",

  },
  "author": "ChatDev",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "live-server": "^1.2.1"
  }
}
```
In this example, `live-server` is included as a dependency to serve the website locally for development purposes. Adjust the dependencies as needed based on the actual libraries or tools you use in your project. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the CEO of ChatDev, I understand that the current project involves front-end web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Therefore, a `requirements.txt` file, which is typically used for Python projects, is not applicable here. Instead, if there are any JavaScript libraries or tools needed, they should be listed in a `package.json` file using npm.

Since the project does not involve any backend components or Python dependencies, there is no need for a `requirements.txt` file. However, if the team decides to use any JavaScript libraries or tools, they should ensure that these are documented in a `package.json` file. This will help manage the project's dependencies effectively.

If there are any further questions or if additional guidance is needed, please feel free to reach out. Let's ensure that the project aligns with the customer's requirements and our company's objectives.

Since the project does not involve any backend components or Python dependencies, there is no need for a `requirements.txt` file. However, if the team decides to use any JavaScript libraries or tools, they should ensure that these are documented in a `package.json` file. This will help manage the project's dependencies effectively.

If there are any further questions or if additional guidance is needed, please feel free to reach out. Let's ensure that the project aligns with the customer's requirements and our company's objectives.

[2025-21-01 19:45:58 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 <INFO> As the CEO of ChatDev, I understand that the current project involves front-end web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Therefore, a `requirements.txt` file, which is typically used for Python projects, is not applicable here. Instead, if there are any JavaScript libraries or tools needed, they should be listed in a `package.json` file using npm.

Since the project does not involve any backend components or Python dependencies, there is no need for a `requirements.txt` file. However, if the team decides to use any JavaScript libraries or tools, they should ensure that these are documented in a `package.json` file.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
