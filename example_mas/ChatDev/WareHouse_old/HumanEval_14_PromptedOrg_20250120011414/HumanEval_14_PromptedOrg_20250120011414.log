Given the task at hand, which involves writing a function to return all prefixes of a given string, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task is purely code-based and does not require any visualization or presentation format. An application can effectively implement and demonstrate the functionality of the code. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. Since the task is focused on implementing a specific function in code, an "Application" would be the most appropriate product modality. It allows us to directly address the customer's request by providing a functional piece of software code. Let's proceed with this modality.

.
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To complete the task, we need to implement the function `all_prefixes` which returns a list of all prefixes of a given string from shortest to longest. Since the task is straightforward and does not require multiple files or classes, we will implement this function in a single file named `main.py`.

Here's the breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Function Name**: `all_prefixes`
   - **Purpose**: To generate and return a list of all prefixes of a given string from shortest to longest.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - We will iterate over the string and collect substrings starting from the first character up to the current character.
   - Append each substring to a list.
   - Return the list of prefixes.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains the implementation of the function `all_prefixes` which returns a list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string.

'''

from typing import List

def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
    >>> all_prefixes('abc')
    ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """
    prefixes = []
    for i in range(1, len(string) + 1):
        prefixes.append(string[:i])
    return prefixes
```

This code defines the `all_prefixes` function which takes a string as input and returns a list of its prefixes. The function iterates over the string, slicing it from the start to the current position, and appends each slice to the list of prefixes. Finally, it returns the list of prefixes.

Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The function `all_prefixes` only uses standard Python libraries, which are included with Python itself. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```

This empty file signifies that the project does not require any external Python packages.
