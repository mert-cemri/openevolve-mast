Given the nature of the task, which involves writing software code to solve a specific problem, I believe the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This would allow us to implement the necessary code and provide a functional solution to the customer's request. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" is indeed the most appropriate modality for this task, as it allows us to focus on implementing the required code functionality without any additional interfaces or presentations. Let's proceed with this modality.

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

This implementation follows the rules provided in the task description. It initializes the sequence with `tri(0)` as `1` based on the example output, and then iteratively calculates each subsequent term according to whether the index is even or odd. The function returns the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.

[2025-20-01 13:57:11 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 To solve the task, we need to implement the function `tri(n)` that generates the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence as described. The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus on implementing the logic in a single Python file, `main.py`.

### Core Function

- **Function `tri(n)`**: This function will calculate the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence based on the given rules and return them as a list.

Now, let's implement the code in `main.py`.

FILENAME: main.py

```python
'''

This module contains the implementation of the Tribonacci sequence generator.
The function `tri(n)` returns the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.

'''

def tri(n):
    """Generate the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    
    Args:
        n (int): A non-negative integer representing the number of terms to generate.
        
    Returns:
        list: A list containing the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a non-negative integer")
    
    # Initialize the list with the first element of the sequence
    sequence = [1]  # tri(0) is assumed to be 1 based on the example output
    
    # Generate the sequence up to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i == 1:
            sequence.append(3)  # tri(1) = 3
        elif i % 2 == 0:
            sequence.append(1 + i // 2)  # tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even
        else:
            # tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd
            # We need to calculate tri(n + 1) as well
            if i + 1 <= n:
                next_value = 1 + (i + 1) // 2 if (i + 1) % 2 == 0 else sequence[-1] + sequence[-2] + (1 + (i + 2) // 2)
                sequence.append(next_value)
            sequence[i] = sequence[i - 1] + sequence[i - 2] + sequence[i + 1]
    
    return sequence

# Example usage:
# print(tri(3))  # Output: [1, 3, 2, 8]
```

You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            
def tri(n):
    """Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
    the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    For example:
    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
    tri(4) = 3
    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required since it only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you want to include a Python version specification, you can do so. Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

```
# No external packages required
# Optionally specify a Python version
# python_version >= 3.6
```

This file indicates that no additional packages are needed for the project to run properly. If you want to ensure compatibility with a specific Python version, you can uncomment and specify the version line.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)
