To solve the task, we need to implement the `correct_bracketing` function in Python. The function should check if every opening bracket `<` has a corresponding closing bracket `>`. This can be achieved by using a counter to track the balance of brackets as we iterate through the string.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. Initialize a counter to zero. This counter will track the balance of opening and closing brackets.
2. Iterate through each character in the input string.
3. If the character is an opening bracket `<`, increment the counter.
4. If the character is a closing bracket `>`, decrement the counter.
5. If at any point the counter becomes negative, it means there is a closing bracket without a matching opening bracket, so return `False`.
6. After iterating through the string, check if the counter is zero. If it is, return `True` (all brackets are matched); otherwise, return `False`.

Now, let's implement this logic in the `main.py` file.

```python

'''

This module contains a function to check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in a given string.

def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:

    >>> correct_bracketing("<")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("<>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
    False
    """
    balance = 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '>':
            balance -= 1
        if balance < 0:
            return False
    return balance == 0

```

This code defines the `correct_bracketing` function, which checks if every opening bracket `<` has a corresponding closing bracket `>`. The function uses a balance counter to ensure that the brackets are correctly matched.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

The Programmer's response is correct. Since the provided code does not utilize any external libraries or packages, there are no dependencies required for the project. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty. Here is how it should look:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

This ensures that anyone using the project understands that no additional packages need to be installed for the code to function as intended. If there are any further questions or tasks, feel free to let me know.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

### Function Signature

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
```

### Examples

- `correct_bracketing("<")` returns `False`
- `correct_bracketing("<>")` returns `True`
- `correct_bracketing("<<><>>")` returns `True`
- `correct_bracketing("><<>")` returns `False`
