Given the task is to write a piece of software code to determine if a number is prime, I believe the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This would allow us to implement the necessary logic in Python and provide a straightforward solution without any additional interfaces or complexities. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" is indeed the most suitable product modality for this task, as it allows us to focus solely on the implementation of the prime-checking logic in Python, without any unnecessary features or interfaces.

To complete the task, we need to implement the `is_prime` function in Python to determine if a given number is prime. The task specifies that we should not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant, so we will focus solely on the logic for checking prime numbers.

### Core Function

- **Function: `is_prime(n)`**
  - **Purpose**: To determine if a given integer `n` is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.

### Implementation

Let's implement the `is_prime` function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python
'''

This module contains a function to check if a number is prime.

'''

def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.
    
    >>> is_prime(6)
    False
    >>> is_prime(101)
    True
    >>> is_prime(11)
    True
    >>> is_prime(13441)
    True
    >>> is_prime(61)
    True
    >>> is_prime(4)
    False
    >>> is_prime(1)
    False
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Checks**: 
  - If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime.
  - If `n` is 2 or 3, it is prime.
  - If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, it is not prime.

- **Loop through potential factors**:
  - Start with `i = 5` and check divisibility up to the square root of `n`.
  - Increment `i` by 6 in each iteration to check only numbers of the form `6k ± 1` (since all primes greater than 3 are of this form).

This implementation efficiently checks for prime numbers and should work correctly for the provided test cases.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required, as it only contains a function to check if a number is prime using basic Python operations. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, to maintain a standard format, you can include a comment indicating that no additional packages are needed.

Here's how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required, as it only contains a function to check if a number is prime using basic Python operations. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, to maintain a standard format, you can include a comment indicating that no additional packages are needed.
Here's how the `requirements.txt` file would look:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Prime Checker

A simple Python module to determine if a number is prime.

## Introduction

This software provides a single function, `is_prime(n)`, which checks if a given number `n` is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.

## Main Function

### `is_prime(n)`

- **Description**: Determines if the input number `n` is a prime number.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `n` (int): The number to be checked.
- **Returns**: 
  - `bool`: `True` if `n` is a prime number, `False` otherwise.
- **Examples**:
  ```python
  >>> is_prime(6)
  False
  >>> is_prime(101)
  True
  >>> is_prime(11)
  True
  >>> is_prime(13441)
  True
  >>> is_prime(61)
  True
  >>> is_prime(4)
  False
  >>> is_prime(1)
  False
  ```

 # Prime Checker

A simple Python module to determine if a number is prime.

## Introduction

This software provides a single function, `is_prime(n)`, which checks if a given number `n` is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.

## Main Function

### `is_prime(n)`

- **Description**: Determines if the input number `n` is a prime number.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `n` (int): The number to be checked.
- **Returns**: 
  - `bool`: `True` if `n` is a prime number, `False` otherwise.
- **Examples**:
  ```python
  >>> is_prime(6)
  False
  >>> is_prime(101)
  True
  >>> is_prime(11)
  True
  >>> is_prime(13441)
  True
  >>> is_prime(61)
  True
  >>> is_prime(4)
  False
  >>> is_prime(1)
  False
  ```
