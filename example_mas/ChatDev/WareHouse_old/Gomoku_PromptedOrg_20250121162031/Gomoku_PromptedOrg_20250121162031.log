Given the task to develop a standard Gomoku game, it seems most appropriate to choose a product modality that allows for interactive and visual gameplay. Considering the options available, an "Application" would be the most suitable modality, as it can implement a visualized game using programming languages like Python. This would allow us to create an interactive and engaging experience for users. What are your thoughts on this?

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a standard Gomoku game..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Develop a standard Gomoku game.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To develop a standard Gomoku game in Python, we will need to create several core classes and functions. Here's a breakdown of the necessary components:

1. **Game**: This class will manage the overall game state, including the board, players, and game logic.
   - `__init__`: Initialize the game with a board and players.
   - `play_move`: Allow a player to place a stone on the board.
   - `check_winner`: Check if there is a winner after each move.
   - `is_draw`: Check if the game is a draw.

2. **Board**: This class will represent the game board.
   - `__init__`: Initialize the board with a specified size.
   - `place_stone`: Place a stone on the board.
   - `is_valid_move`: Check if a move is valid.
   - `print_board`: Display the current state of the board.

3. **Player**: This class will represent a player in the game.
   - `__init__`: Initialize a player with a name and stone type (black or white).

4. **main**: This function will run the game loop, allowing players to take turns until there is a winner or a draw.

Now, let's implement the code for each file:

### main.py

```python
'''

Main module to run the Gomoku game.

'''

from game import Game
from player import Player

def main():
    print("Welcome to Gomoku!")
    player1 = Player("Player 1", "X")

    game = Game(player1, player2)

    while True:
        game.board.print_board()
        current_player = game.current_player
        print(f"{current_player.name}'s turn ({current_player.stone}):")
        row = int(input("Enter row: "))
        col = int(input("Enter column: "))
        
        if game.play_move(row, col):
            if game.check_winner():
                game.board.print_board()

                break

This implementation provides a basic Gomoku game where two players can take turns placing stones on a 15x15 board. The game checks for a winner after each move and ends when a player wins or the board is full, resulting in a draw.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a standard Gomoku game..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The code is generally well-structured and follows the task requirements. However, there is a potential issue with user input that could lead to a runtime error if the input is not an integer. The `main.py` file directly converts user input to integers without validation, which could cause the program to crash if the user enters a non-numeric value.

### Comment with Highest Priority:
**Input Validation Needed:** The `main.py` file lacks input validation for the row and column inputs. Directly converting user input to integers without checking can lead to a `ValueError` if the input is not a valid integer.

### Suggestion for Revision:
Add input validation to ensure that the user inputs are integers and within the valid range of the board. You can implement a loop to repeatedly prompt the user until valid input is received.

```python
def get_valid_input(prompt, size):
    while True:
        try:
            value = int(input(prompt))
            if 0 <= value < size:
                return value
            else:
                print(f"Please enter a number between 0 and {size - 1}.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.")

def main():
    print("Welcome to Gomoku!")
    player1 = Player("Player 1", "X")
    player2 = Player("Player 2", "O")
    game = Game(player1, player2)
    while True:
        game.board.print_board()
        current_player = game.current_player
        print(f"{current_player.name}'s turn ({current_player.stone}):")
        row = get_valid_input("Enter row: ", game.board.size)
        col = get_valid_input("Enter column: ", game.board.size)
        if game.play_move(row, col):
            if game.check_winner():
                game.board.print_board()
                print(f"Congratulations {current_player.name}, you win!")
                break
            elif game.is_draw():
                game.board.print_board()
                print("It's a draw!")
                break
            game.switch_player()
        else:
            print("Invalid move. Try again.")
```

This change ensures that the program handles invalid inputs gracefully and prevents runtime errors due to incorrect input types.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is generally well-structured and follows the task requirements. However, there is a potential issue with user input that could lead to a runtime error if the input is not an integer. The `main.py` file directly converts user input to integers without validation, which could cause the program to crash if the user enters a non-numeric value.

### Comment with Highest Priority:
**Input Validation Needed:** The `main.py` file lacks input validation for the row and column inputs. Directly converting user input to integers without checking can lead to a `ValueError` if the input is not a valid integer.

### Suggestion for Revision:
Add input validation to ensure that the user inputs are integers and within the valid range of the board. You can implement a loop to repeatedly prompt the user until valid input is received.

```python
def get_valid_input(prompt, size):
    while True:
        try:
            value = int(input(prompt))
            if 0 <= value < size:
                return value
            else:
                print(f"Please enter a number between 0 and {size - 1}.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.")

def main():
    print("Welcome to Gomoku!")
    player1 = Player("Player 1", "X")
    player2 = Player("Player 2", "O")
    game = Game(player1, player2)
    while True:
        game.board.print_board()
        current_player = game.current_player
        print(f"{current_player.name}'s turn ({current_player.stone}):")
        row = get_valid_input("Enter row: ", game.board.size)
        col = get_valid_input("Enter column: ", game.board.size)
        if game.play_move(row, col):
            if game.check_winner():
                game.board.print_board()
                print(f"Congratulations {current_player.name}, you win!")
                break
            elif game.is_draw():
                game.board.print_board()
                print("It's a draw!")
                break
            game.switch_player()
        else:
            print("Invalid move. Try again.")
```

This change ensures that the program handles invalid inputs gracefully and prevents runtime errors due to incorrect input types."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

The main.py file directly converts user input to integers without validation, which could cause the program to crash if the user enters a non-numeric value.\n\n### Comment with Highest Priority:\nInput Validation Needed: The main.py file lacks input validation for the row and column inputs. Directly converting user input to integers without checking can lead to a ValueError if the input is not a valid integer.\n\n### Suggestion for Revision:\nAdd input validation to ensure that the user inputs are integers and within the valid range of the board. You can implement a loop to repeatedly prompt the user until valid input is received.\n\npython\ndef get_valid_input(prompt, size):\n    while True:\n        try:\n            value = int(input(prompt))\n            if 0 &lt;= value &lt; size:\n                return value\n            else:\n                print(f"Please enter a number between 0 and {size - 1}.")\n        except ValueError:\n            print("Invalid input.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a standard Gomoku game..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with user input handling in the `main.py` file. The `get_valid_input` function uses `input()` which is blocking and requires user interaction via the console. This might not be suitable for all application modalities, especially if the game is intended to be a GUI application or run in environments where console input is not feasible.

To address this, consider abstracting the input mechanism so that it can be easily adapted for different interfaces (e.g., console, GUI, network). This can be done by creating an interface or a separate class responsible for handling user input, which can be overridden or extended for different modalities.

Here is a suggestion for revision:

1. Create an `InputHandler` class that encapsulates the input logic.
2. Modify the `main.py` to use this `InputHandler` class for obtaining user input.

Example:

```python
# input_handler.py
class InputHandler:
    def get_valid_input(self, prompt, size):
        while True:
            try:
                value = int(input(prompt))
                if 0 <= value < size:
                    return value
                else:
                    print(f"Please enter a number between 0 and {size - 1}.")
            except ValueError:
                print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.")

# main.py
from input_handler import InputHandler

def main():
    print("Welcome to Gomoku!")
    player1 = Player("Player 1", "X")
    player2 = Player("Player 2", "O")
    game = Game(player1, player2)
    input_handler = InputHandler()
    while True:
        game.board.print_board()
        current_player = game.current_player
        print(f"{current_player.name}'s turn ({current_player.stone}):")
        row = input_handler.get_valid_input("Enter row: ", game.board.size)
        col = input_handler.get_valid_input("Enter column: ", game.board.size)
        if game.play_move(row, col):
            if game.check_winner():
                game.board.print_board()
                print(f"Congratulations {current_player.name}, you win!")
                break
            elif game.is_draw():
                game.board.print_board()
                print("It's a draw!")
                break
            game.switch_player()
        else:
            print("Invalid move. Try again.")
```

This change will make it easier to adapt the game for different input methods in the future.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with user input handling in the `main.py` file. The `get_valid_input` function uses `input()` which is blocking and requires user interaction via the console. This might not be suitable for all application modalities, especially if the game is intended to be a GUI application or run in environments where console input is not feasible.

To address this, consider abstracting the input mechanism so that it can be easily adapted for different interfaces (e.g., console, GUI, network). This can be done by creating an interface or a separate class responsible for handling user input, which can be overridden or extended for different modalities.

Here is a suggestion for revision:

1. Create an `InputHandler` class that encapsulates the input logic.
2. Modify the `main.py` to use this `InputHandler` class for obtaining user input.

Example:

```python
# input_handler.py
class InputHandler:
    def get_valid_input(self, prompt, size):
        while True:
            try:
                value = int(input(prompt))
                if 0 <= value < size:
                    return value
                else:
                    print(f"Please enter a number between 0 and {size - 1}.")
            except ValueError:
                print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.")

# main.py
from input_handler import InputHandler

def main():

In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

However, there is a potential issue with user input handling in the main.py file. The get_valid_input function uses input() which is blocking and requires user interaction via the console. This might not be suitable for all application modalities, especially if the game is intended to be a GUI application or run in environments where console input is not feasible.\n\nTo address this, consider abstracting the input mechanism so that it can be easily adapted for different interfaces (e.g., console, GUI, network). This can be done by creating an interface or a separate class responsible for handling user input, which can be overridden or extended for different modalities.\n\nHere is a suggestion for revision:\n\n1. Create an InputHandler class that encapsulates the input logic.\n2. Modify the main.py to use this InputHandler class for obtaining user input.\n\nExample:\n\npython\n# input_handler.py\nclass InputHandler:\n    def get_valid_input(self, prompt, size):\n        while True:\n            try:\n                value = int(input(prompt))\n                if 0 &lt;= value &lt; size:\n                    return value\n                else:\n                    print(f"Please enter a number between 0 and {size - 1}.")\n            except ValueError:\n                print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.")\n\n# main.py\nfrom input_handler import InputHandler\n\ndef main():\n    print("Welcome to Gomoku!")\n    player1 = Player("Player 1", "X")\n    player2 = Player("Player 2", "O")\n    game = Game(player1, player2)\n    input_handler = InputHandler()\n    while True:\n        game.board.print_board()\n        current_player = game.current_player\n        print(f"{current_player.name}\'s turn ({current_player.stone}):")\n        row = input_handler.get_valid_input("Enter row: ", game.board.size)\n        col = input_handler.get_valid_input("Enter column: ", game.board.size)\n        if game.play_move(row, col):\n            if game.check_winner():\n                game.board.print_board()\n                print(f"Congratulations {current_player.name}, you win!")\n                break\n            elif game.is_draw():\n                game.board.print_board()\n                print("It\'s a draw!")\n                break\n            game.switch_player()\n        else:\n            print("Invalid move.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a standard Gomoku game..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the `check_winner` method in the `Board` class. The current implementation checks for a winning line of exactly 5 stones, but it does not account for the possibility of a longer line that includes a winning sequence. In Gomoku, a player wins if they have an unbroken line of exactly 5 stones, not more. Therefore, the code should ensure that the line is exactly 5 stones long without being part of a longer sequence.

To fix this, modify the `check_line` method to ensure that the line of stones is exactly 5 and not part of a longer sequence:

```python
def check_line(self, row, col, stone, delta_row, delta_col):
    count = 0
    for _ in range(5):
        if 0 <= row < self.size and 0 <= col < self.size and self.grid[row][col] == stone:
            count += 1
            row += delta_row
            col += delta_col
        else:
            break
    # Check if exactly 5 stones and not part of a longer sequence
    if count == 5:
        # Check the previous and next positions in the line
        prev_row, prev_col = row - 5 * delta_row, col - 5 * delta_col
        next_row, next_col = row, col
        if (not (0 <= prev_row < self.size and 0 <= prev_col < self.size) or self.grid[prev_row][prev_col] != stone) and \
           (not (0 <= next_row < self.size and 0 <= next_col < self.size) or self.grid[next_row][next_col] != stone):
            return True
    return False
```

This change ensures that the game correctly identifies a win condition according to the rules of Gomoku.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the `check_winner` method in the `Board` class. The current implementation checks for a winning line of exactly 5 stones, but it does not account for the possibility of a longer line that includes a winning sequence. In Gomoku, a player wins if they have an unbroken line of exactly 5 stones, not more. Therefore, the code should ensure that the line is exactly 5 stones long without being part of a longer sequence.

To fix this, modify the `check_line` method to ensure that the line of stones is exactly 5 and not part of a longer sequence:

```python
def check_line(self, row, col, stone, delta_row, delta_col):
    count = 0
    for _ in range(5):
        if 0 <= row < self.size and 0 <= col < self.size and self.grid[row][col] == stone:
            count += 1
            row += delta_row
            col += delta_col
        else:
            break
    # Check if exactly 5 stones and not part of a longer sequence
    if count == 5:
        # Check the previous and next positions in the line
        prev_row, prev_col = row - 5 * delta_row, col - 5 * delta_col
        next_row, next_col = row, col
        if (not (0 <= prev_row < self.size and 0 <= prev_col < self.size) or self.grid[prev_row][prev_col] != stone) and \
           (not (0 <= next_row < self.size and 0 <= next_col < self.size) or self.grid[next_row][next_col] != stone):
            return True
    return False
```

This change ensures that the game correctly identifies a win condition according to the rules of Gomoku."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of ChatDev. Your primary responsibilities include overseeing all technical aspects of the company. You establish the company's technical vision and lead technological development, ensuring that technology resources align with the company's business needs.
You report to the CEO and collaborate with other executives to integrate technology into the company's strategy.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a standard Gomoku game..
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

Based on the provided code, it appears that the Gomoku game does not rely on any external libraries or packages beyond the standard Python library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you plan to extend the functionality in the future or if there are any hidden dependencies not mentioned in the code snippets, you would list them here.

For now, the `requirements.txt` file would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project.
```

If you later decide to add features that require external libraries, you would update this file accordingly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, it appears that the Gomoku game does not rely on any external libraries or packages beyond the standard Python library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you plan to extend the functionality in the future or if there are any hidden dependencies not mentioned in the code snippets, you would list them here.
For now, the `requirements.txt` file would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project.
```
If you later decide to add features that require external libraries, you would update this file accordingly. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the CEO, I appreciate the thorough analysis and response from the Programmer. It seems that the current implementation of the Gomoku game does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file is indeed not necessary at this point.

However, I would like to ensure that our solution is robust and future-proof. Here are a few strategic considerations:

1. **Future Scalability**: If we plan to enhance the game with additional features such as a graphical user interface (GUI) or online multiplayer capabilities, we may need to incorporate external libraries. It's important to keep this in mind for future updates.

2. **Documentation**: Even though the `requirements.txt` is empty now, maintaining it as part of the project structure is a good practice. It signals to future developers or collaborators that dependencies should be documented here.

3. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Ensure that the game has been thoroughly tested for functionality and user experience. Consider implementing unit tests to maintain code quality.

4. **User Feedback**: Once the game is deployed, gather user feedback to identify potential areas for improvement or additional features that users might find valuable.

5. **Marketing and Deployment**: Coordinate with the marketing team to promote the game and ensure it reaches the target audience effectively.

Let's proceed with finalizing the current version of the Gomoku game and prepare for any future enhancements. If there are no further dependencies or immediate changes required, we can consider this task complete.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a standard Gomoku game..
To complete the task, you will provide strategic guidance and instructions to your team, ensuring that the solution meets the customer's needs and aligns with the company's objectives.]

# Gomoku Game User Manual

Welcome to the Gomoku Game! This manual will guide you through the installation, setup, and gameplay of the Gomoku application developed in Python. 

## Introduction

Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, is a traditional board game played on a 15x15 grid. The objective is to be the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Main Functions

- **Game Initialization**: The game initializes with two players, each assigned a unique stone ('X' or 'O').
- **Board Management**: A 15x15 board is created where players can place their stones.
- **Gameplay**: Players take turns to place their stones on the board. The game checks for a winner or a draw after each move.
- **Winner Detection**: The game checks for five consecutive stones in any direction to declare a winner.
- **Draw Detection**: The game checks if the board is full without any winner to declare a draw.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the Gomoku game code to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your directory to the project folder.

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install any required dependencies using pip. If there are any specific dependencies, they will be listed in a `requirements.txt` file.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Note: The current version of the game does not have external dependencies beyond standard Python libraries.

## How to Play

1. **Run the Game**: Execute the main script to start the game.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Game Instructions**: 
   - The game will welcome you to Gomoku.
   - Players will take turns to place their stones on the board.
   - Enter the row and column numbers when prompted to place your stone.
   - The board will be displayed after each move, showing the current state of the game.

3. **Winning the Game**: 
   - The first player to align five stones in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
   - The game will announce the winner and end.

4. **Draw Condition**: 
   - If the board is filled without any player achieving five in a row, the game will declare a draw.

5. **Invalid Moves**: 
   - If a player attempts to place a stone in an occupied cell or outside the board, the game will prompt for a valid move.

## Conclusion

Enjoy playing Gomoku! This game provides a simple yet challenging experience for players of all ages. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please contact our support team.

Thank you for choosing our Gomoku game!
