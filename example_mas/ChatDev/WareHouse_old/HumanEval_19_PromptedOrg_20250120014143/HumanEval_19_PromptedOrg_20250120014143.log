To solve the task, we need to implement the `sort_numbers` function that takes a space-delimited string of numerals (from 'zero' to 'nine') and returns the string with numbers sorted from smallest to largest. Here's how we can break down the task:

1. **Function Name**: `sort_numbers`
   - **Purpose**: To sort a space-delimited string of numerals from 'zero' to 'nine' in ascending order.

2. **Steps to Implement**:
   - Create a mapping of the numeral words to their corresponding integer values.
   - Split the input string into individual numeral words.
   - Convert these numeral words to their corresponding integer values using the mapping.
   - Sort the list of integers.
   - Convert the sorted integers back to their numeral words.
   - Join the sorted numeral words into a single string and return it.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

    }
    
    # Mapping of integer values back to numeral words
    int_to_numeral = {v: k for k, v in numeral_to_int.items()}
    
    # Split the input string into individual numeral words
    numeral_words = numbers.split()
    
    # Convert numeral words to integers
    numeral_integers = [numeral_to_int[word] for word in numeral_words]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required since it only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, to maintain the structure and indicate that no additional packages are needed, you can create an empty `requirements.txt` file or include a comment indicating that there are no dependencies.

Here's how you can create the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

This comment is optional, but it can be helpful for anyone reviewing the project to understand that no additional packages are needed.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required since it only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, to maintain the structure and indicate that no additional packages are needed, you can create an empty `requirements.txt` file or include a comment indicating that there are no dependencies.
Here's how you can create the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```
This comment is optional, but it can be helpful for anyone reviewing the project to understand that no additional packages are needed. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

The programmer has correctly identified that the provided code does not require any external dependencies or packages, as it only utilizes basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should be empty or contain a comment indicating the absence of dependencies. Here's how you can create the `requirements.txt` file:

```

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation
