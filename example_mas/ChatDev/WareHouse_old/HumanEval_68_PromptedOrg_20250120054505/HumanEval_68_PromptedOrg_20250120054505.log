    "Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes
    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.

Given the task at hand, which involves writing a function to solve a specific algorithmic problem, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a software solution in Python, which aligns with the capabilities of an Application product modality. What are your thoughts on this?

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `pluck` that processes an array of non-negative integers and returns the smallest even value along with its index. If no even values are present, it should return an empty list. The function will be implemented in a single file, `main.py`.

Here is the breakdown of the function:

- **Function Name**: `pluck`
- **Purpose**: To find the smallest even number in the array and return it along with its index. If there are multiple smallest even numbers, return the one with the smallest index. If no even numbers are present, return an empty list.
- **Input**: A list of non-negative integers.
- **Output**: A list containing the smallest even number and its index, or an empty list if no even numbers are found.

Now, let's implement the code in `main.py`.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The function `pluck` only uses built-in Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for the sake of completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

If you anticipate adding dependencies in the future or want to include a specific Python version, you can specify it like this:

```
# Python version requirement (optional)
# python_version >= 3.6
```

But for the current state of the project, no external packages are needed.

# Pluck Function User Manual

## Introduction

The `pluck` function is a simple utility designed to process an array of non-negative integers. It identifies and returns the smallest even number from the array along with its index. If no even numbers are present, or if the array is empty, the function returns an empty list.

## Main Functionality

- **pluck(arr):** This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns a list containing the smallest even number and its index. If there are multiple occurrences of the smallest even number, the function returns the first occurrence. If no even numbers are found, it returns an empty list.

## Installation

The `pluck` function is implemented in Python and does not require any external dependencies. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. The recommended Python version is 3.6 or higher.

### Steps to Install Python

1. **Download Python:**
   - Visit the official Python website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)
   - Download the latest version of Python for your operating system.

2. **Install Python:**
   - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
   - Ensure that you check the option to add Python to your system's PATH during installation.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Type `python --version` and press Enter.
   - Ensure that the installed version is 3.6 or higher.

## How to Use the Pluck Function

1. **Create a Python Script:**
   - Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
   - Create a new file named `main.py`.

2. **Implement the Pluck Function:**
   - Copy the following code into `main.py`:

   ```python
   def pluck(arr):
       """
       Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes,
       your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
       The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.
       If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found, return the node that has the smallest index.
       The plucked node should be returned in a list, [smallest_value, its index].
       If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].
       """
       smallest_even = None
       smallest_index = -1
       for index, value in enumerate(arr):
           if value % 2 == 0:
               if smallest_even is None or value < smallest_even:
                   smallest_even = value
                   smallest_index = index
       if smallest_even is not None:
           return [smallest_even, smallest_index]
       else:
           return []
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Save the `main.py` file.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.
   - Run the script using the command: `python main.py`

4. **Test the Function:**
   - You can test the function by calling it with different arrays and printing the results. For example:

   ```python
   print(pluck([4, 2, 3]))  # Output: [2, 1]
   print(pluck([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [2, 1]
   print(pluck([]))         # Output: []
   print(pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]))  # Output: [0, 1]
   ```

## Conclusion

The `pluck` function is a straightforward utility for identifying the smallest even number in an array of non-negative integers. With no external dependencies, it is easy to integrate into any Python project. Follow the instructions above to install Python and use the function in your applications.

- **pluck(arr):** This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns a list containing the smallest even number and its index. If there are multiple occurrences of the smallest even number, the function returns the first occurrence. If no even numbers are found, it returns an empty list.

## Installation

The `pluck` function is implemented in Python and does not require any external dependencies. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. The recommended Python version is 3.6 or higher.

### Steps to Install Python

1. **Download Python:**
   - Visit the official Python website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)
   - Download the latest version of Python for your operating system.

2. **Install Python:**
   - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
   - Ensure that you check the option to add Python to your system's PATH during installation.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Type `python --version` and press Enter.
   - Ensure that the installed version is 3.6 or higher.

## How to Use the Pluck Function

1. **Create a Python Script:**
   - Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
   - Create a new file named `main.py`.

2. **Implement the Pluck Function:**
   - Copy the following code into `main.py`:

   ```python
   def pluck(arr):
       """
       Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes,
       your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
       The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.
       If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found, return the node that has the smallest index.
       The plucked node should be returned in a list, [smallest_value, its index].
       If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].
       """
       smallest_even = None
       smallest_index = -1
       for index, value in enumerate(arr):
           if value % 2 == 0:
               if smallest_even is None or value < smallest_even:
                   smallest_even = value
                   smallest_index = index
       if smallest_even is not None:
           return [smallest_even, smallest_index]
       else:
           return []
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Save the `main.py` file.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.
   - Run the script using the command: `python main.py`

4. **Test the Function:**
   - You can test the function by calling it with different arrays and printing the results. For example:

   ```python
   print(pluck([4, 2, 3]))  # Output: [2, 1]
   print(pluck([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [2, 1]
   print(pluck([]))         # Output: []
   print(pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]))  # Output: [0, 1]
   ```

## Conclusion

The `pluck` function is a straightforward utility for identifying the smallest even number in an array of non-negative integers. With no external dependencies, it is easy to integrate into any Python project. Follow the instructions above to install Python and use the function in your applications.
