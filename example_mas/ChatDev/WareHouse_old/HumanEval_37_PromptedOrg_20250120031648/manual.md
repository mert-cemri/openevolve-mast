# Sort Even Function User Manual

Welcome to the Sort Even Function user manual. This document provides detailed instructions on how to use the Sort Even function, which is designed to sort elements at even indices of a list while keeping elements at odd indices unchanged.

## Overview

The Sort Even function is a Python-based utility that processes a list of numbers. It extracts elements located at even indices, sorts them, and then reconstructs the list with these sorted elements while leaving the odd-indexed elements in their original positions.

### Main Functionality

- **sort_even(l: list):** This function takes a list `l` and returns a new list where the elements at even indices are sorted, while the elements at odd indices remain unchanged.

#### Example Usage

```python
>>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])
[1, 2, 3]

>>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])
[3, 6, 5, 4]
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to use. You only need Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**
   - You can clone the repository using Git or download the ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script using Python by running the following command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

4. **Modify the Input List:**
   - You can modify the input list in the `main.py` file to test different scenarios. The function will output the list with sorted even indices.

## Conclusion

The Sort Even function is a simple yet effective tool for sorting elements at even indices of a list. With no external dependencies, it is easy to set up and use.
