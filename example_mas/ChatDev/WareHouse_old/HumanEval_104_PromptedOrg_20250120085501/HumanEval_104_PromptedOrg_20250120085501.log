Given the task at hand, which involves writing a function to process a list of integers and return a sorted list based on specific criteria, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application." This is because the task involves implementing a software tool using Python, which aligns with the application modality. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. The task involves writing a Python function to process data, which fits well within the scope of an "Application." This modality allows us to focus on the functionality and logic required to solve the problem without any additional presentation or visualization elements. Let's proceed with this modality.

To solve the task, we need to implement the `unique_digits` function in Python. The function should take a list of positive integers and return a sorted list of integers that do not contain any even digits. The returned list should be sorted in increasing order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Function Name**: `unique_digits`
   - **Purpose**: To filter out numbers that contain any even digits from a list and return the remaining numbers sorted in increasing order.

2. **Logic**:
   - Iterate through each number in the list.
   - Convert each number to a string to check each digit.
   - Check if any digit in the number is even (i.e., 0, 2, 4, 6, 8).
   - If a number contains no even digits, add it to the result list.
   - Sort the result list before returning it.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Use list comprehension for concise and efficient filtering.
   - Use the `sorted()` function to sort the final list.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

Given a list of positive integers x, return a sorted list of all 
elements that haven't any even digit.

Note: Returned list should be sorted in increasing order.

For example:
>>> unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1])
[1, 15, 33]
>>> unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10])
[]

'''

def unique_digits(x):
    return sorted([num for num in x if all(int(digit) % 2 != 0 for digit in str(num))])

```

This code defines the `unique_digits` function, which filters and sorts the list of numbers as required. The function uses list comprehension to iterate over each number, converts it to a string to check each digit, and ensures all digits are odd before including the number in the result list. Finally, it sorts the list before returning it.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages used. The code relies solely on Python's built-in functions and data types. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file does not need to specify any dependencies. It should be empty or not included at all. However, if you still want to provide an empty `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Unique Digits Software

This software provides a function to filter and sort a list of positive integers, returning only those numbers that do not contain any even digits. The result is a sorted list in increasing order.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `unique_digits`, which processes a list of positive integers and returns a sorted list of numbers that do not contain any even digits.

### Function: `unique_digits`

- **Input:** A list of positive integers.
- **Output:** A sorted list of integers that do not contain any even digits.

#### Example Usage

```python
>>> unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1])
[1, 15, 33]

>>> unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10])
[]
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
   Replace `<project-directory>` with the actual directory name.

3. **Run the Python Script:**
   You can directly run the `main.py` script using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Import the Function:**
   You can import the `unique_digits` function into your own Python scripts or interactive sessions.

   ```python
   from main import unique_digits
   ```

2. **Call the Function:**
   Pass a list of positive integers to the `unique_digits` function to get the desired output.

   ```python
   result = unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1])
   print(result)  # Output: [1, 15, 33]
   ```

## Documentation

For further information and examples, please refer to the inline documentation within the `main.py` file. The function is designed to be straightforward and easy to integrate into larger projects.
