To complete the task, we need to implement the `fix_spaces` function as described in the task. Since the task specifically instructs not to implement a GUI and only to write the necessary code in the `main.py` file, we will focus solely on the function implementation. Here's how we can achieve this:

### Core Function

- **Function Name**: `fix_spaces`
  - **Purpose**: To replace all spaces in a given string with underscores, and if there are more than two consecutive spaces, replace them with a single hyphen.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

#### main.py

```python
'''

This module contains the function fix_spaces which processes a given string
by replacing spaces with underscores and multiple consecutive spaces with a hyphen.

'''

def fix_spaces(text):
    """
    Given a string text, replace all spaces in it with underscores, 
    and if a string has more than 2 consecutive spaces, 
    then replace all consecutive spaces with a hyphen.
    
    Examples:
    fix_spaces("Example") == "Example"
    fix_spaces("Example 1") == "Example_1"
    fix_spaces(" Example 2") == "_Example_2"
    fix_spaces(" Example   3") == "_Example-3"
    """
    import re
    # Replace more than two consecutive spaces with a hyphen
    text = re.sub(r' {3,}', '-', text)
    # Replace remaining spaces with underscores
    text = text.replace(' ', '_')
    return text

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(fix_spaces("Example"))        # Output: "Example"
    print(fix_spaces("Example 1"))      # Output: "Example_1"
    print(fix_spaces(" Example 2"))     # Output: "_Example_2"
    print(fix_spaces(" Example   3"))   # Output: "_Example-3"
```

### Explanation

- **Regular Expression**: We use `re.sub(r' {3,}', '-', text)` to replace any sequence of three or more spaces with a single hyphen.
- **String Replacement**: We then replace any remaining single spaces with underscores using `text.replace(' ', '_')`.

This implementation fulfills the task requirements by processing the input string according to the specified rules.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

# Fix Spaces Software

This software provides a simple utility function, `fix_spaces`, designed to process strings by replacing spaces with underscores and multiple consecutive spaces with a hyphen. This can be particularly useful for formatting text data where consistent spacing is required.

## Main Functionality

### `fix_spaces`

- **Purpose**: The function `fix_spaces` takes a string as input and processes it by:
  - Replacing all single spaces with underscores (`_`).
  - Replacing any sequence of three or more consecutive spaces with a hyphen (`-`).

- **Examples**:
  - `fix_spaces("Example")` returns `"Example"`
  - `fix_spaces("Example 1")` returns `"Example_1"`
  - `fix_spaces(" Example 2")` returns `"_Example_2"`
  - `fix_spaces(" Example   3")` returns `"_Example-3"`

## Installation

### Environment Setup

This software does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

1. **Python Installation**: If Python is not already installed, download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Verify Installation**: Open a terminal or command prompt and verify the installation by typing:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   This should display the installed Python version.

### Running the Software

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Obtain the software files by cloning the repository or downloading them directly.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

To use the `fix_spaces` function, you can either import it into your own Python scripts or run it directly within the `main.py` file.

### Example Usage in a Script

```python
from main import fix_spaces

# Example usage
text = " Example   3"
formatted_text = fix_spaces(text)
print(formatted_text)  # Output: "_Example-3"
```

### Direct Execution

You can also modify the `main.py` file to include test cases or direct calls to the `fix_spaces` function to see its output immediately.

## Documentation

For further details on the function and its implementation, refer to the comments within the `main.py` file. The function is straightforward and does not require additional configuration or dependencies.

Feel free to modify and adapt the function to suit your specific needs. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please contact the development team.
