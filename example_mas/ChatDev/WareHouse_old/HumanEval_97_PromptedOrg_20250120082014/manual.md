# Multiply Unit Digits

This software provides a simple function to multiply the unit digits of two integers. It is designed to solve specific mathematical problems where only the unit digits of the numbers are of interest.

## Main Functionality

The primary function of this software is:

- **multiply(a, b):** This function takes two integers as input and returns the product of their unit digits. The function assumes that the input is always valid.

### Examples

- `multiply(148, 412)` returns `16`.
- `multiply(19, 28)` returns `72`.
- `multiply(2020, 1851)` returns `0`.
- `multiply(14, -15)` returns `20`.

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it easy to set up and use. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed:** You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Clone the repository or download the script:** You can clone the repository using Git or download the `main.py` file directly.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. **Navigate to the directory containing the script:**

   ```bash
   cd <directory-name>
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Open a terminal or command prompt.**

2. **Run the Python script with your desired input:**

   You can execute the script by running Python and calling the `multiply` function with your desired integers.

   ```bash
   python -c "from main import multiply; print(multiply(148, 412))"
   ```

   Replace `148` and `412` with any integers you wish to use.

3. **View the output:**

   The script will output the product of the unit digits of the two integers you provided.

## Additional Information

- **No External Libraries Required:** This software is designed to be lightweight and does not require any additional Python packages.

- **Platform Compatibility:** The script is compatible with any platform that supports Python, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
