Given the nature of the task, which is to design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface allowing two players to take turns and determine the winner, I believe the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This would allow us to implement the visualized game effectively. What are your thoughts?

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python *"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python *. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface using Python, we'll use the `tkinter` library for the GUI. The game will consist of a main file that initializes the game and handles the game logic. Below is the step-by-step plan and the code implementation.

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **TicTacToeGame**: This class will manage the game state, including the board, current player, and game status.
   - `__init__`: Initialize the game board and set the starting player.
   - `reset_game`: Reset the game to its initial state.
   - `make_move`: Handle a player's move and update the board.
   - `check_winner`: Check if there is a winner or if the game is a draw.
   - `switch_player`: Switch the current player after a valid move.

2. **TicTacToeGUI**: This class will handle the graphical user interface using `tkinter`.
   - `__init__`: Set up the main window and buttons.
   - `update_buttons`: Update the button labels based on the game state.
   - `button_click`: Handle button click events.
   - `show_winner`: Display the winner or draw message.

### File Structure

1. **main.py**: The main file that initializes and runs the game.

Let's implement the code:

#### main.py

```python
'''

FILENAME

```python

'''

DOCSTRING

This file contains the main logic for the Tic Tac Toe game using tkinter for the GUI.

This code provides a complete implementation of a tic-tac-toe game with a graphical user interface using `tkinter`. The `TicTacToeGame` class manages the game logic, while the `TicTacToeGUI` class handles the GUI elements and interactions. The game allows two players to take turns, checks for a winner, and can reset for a new game.

main.py
```python
'''
This is a simple tic-tac-toe game for two players. The game allows players to take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The code provided is functional and meets the basic requirements for a tic-tac-toe game. However, to enhance the user experience and ensure robustness, I have the following suggestion:

**Comment with Highest Priority:**
The current implementation uses console-based input and output, which may not be considered a "user-friendly interface" as specified in the task. To improve the user experience, consider implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) using a library such as Tkinter. This will make the game more interactive and visually appealing.

**Suggestions on Revision:**
1. **Implement a GUI:** Use Tkinter to create a window with buttons representing the tic-tac-toe grid. This will allow players to click on the buttons to make their moves instead of typing coordinates.
2. **Update the Game Logic:** Modify the game logic to interact with the GUI elements. For example, update the button text to reflect the player's move and check for a winner after each move.
3. **Enhance User Feedback:** Provide visual feedback for invalid moves or when the game ends (e.g., highlight the winning line or display a message box).

By implementing these changes, the game will align more closely with the task's requirement for a user-friendly interface.

If you need further assistance with implementing these changes, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is functional and meets the basic requirements for a tic-tac-toe game. However, to enhance the user experience and ensure robustness, I have the following suggestion:

**Comment with Highest Priority:**
The current implementation uses console-based input and output, which may not be considered a "user-friendly interface" as specified in the task. To improve the user experience, consider implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) using a library such as Tkinter. This will make the game more interactive and visually appealing.

**Suggestions on Revision:**
1. **Implement a GUI:** Use Tkinter to create a window with buttons representing the tic-tac-toe grid. This will allow players to click on the buttons to make their moves instead of typing coordinates.
2. **Update the Game Logic:** Modify the game logic to interact with the GUI elements. For example, update the button text to reflect the player's move and check for a winner after each move.
3. **Enhance User Feedback:** Provide visual feedback for invalid moves or when the game ends (e.g., highlight the winning line or display a message box).

By implementing these changes, the game will align more closely with the task's requirement for a user-friendly interface.

If you need further assistance with implementing these changes, feel free to ask!"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.
