# Flip Case Utility

The Flip Case Utility is a simple Python application designed to transform the case of each character in a given string. It flips lowercase characters to uppercase and vice versa. This utility is useful for text processing tasks where case transformation is required.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this utility is provided by the `flip_case` function. This function takes a string as input and returns a new string with the case of each character flipped.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import flip_case

result = flip_case('Hello')
print(result)  # Output: 'hELLO'
```

## Quick Install

This project does not require any external dependencies, making it easy to set up and use.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Change your current directory to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Run the Code**

   Since there are no external dependencies, you can directly run the Python script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Import the Function**

   To use the `flip_case` function in your own scripts, import it from the `main` module:

   ```python
   from main import flip_case
   ```

2. **Call the Function**

   Pass a string to the `flip_case` function to get the case-flipped version of the string:

   ```python
   flipped_string = flip_case('YourStringHere')
   ```

3. **Output the Result**

   You can print or further process the flipped string as needed:

   ```python
   print(flipped_string)
   ```

## Documentation

The `flip_case` function is straightforward and does not require additional configuration or setup. For any further questions or support, please refer to the comments within the code or contact the development team.
