To solve the given task, we need to implement a function `solution(lst)` that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all odd elements that are in even positions (0-based index). Let's break down the steps:

1. **Function Name**: `solution`
   - **Purpose**: To calculate the sum of odd integers located at even indices in a given list.

2. **Logic**:
   - Iterate through the list using an index.
   - Check if the index is even.
   - Check if the element at that index is odd.
   - If both conditions are met, add the element to the sum.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

DOCSTRING

'''

def solution(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions.

    Examples:
    solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) ==> 12
    solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ==> 9
    solution([30, 13, 24, 321]) ==> 0
    """
    total = 0
    for index in range(0, len(lst), 2):  # Iterate over even indices
        if lst[index] % 2 != 0:  # Check if the element is odd
            total += lst[index]
    return total
```

This code iterates over the list, checking each element at even indices to see if it is odd, and if so, adds it to the total sum. The function then returns this sum. This implementation meets the requirements specified in the task description.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

# Solution Manual

## Introduction

This software provides a simple function to solve a specific problem: Given a non-empty list of integers, it returns the sum of all odd elements that are located at even positions in the list. This functionality can be useful in various computational scenarios where such a specific filtering and summation operation is needed.

## Main Function

### `solution(lst)`

- **Description**: This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all odd integers that are located at even indices (0-based) in the list.
  
- **Parameters**:
  - `lst` (list): A non-empty list of integers.

- **Returns**:
  - `int`: The sum of the odd integers located at even indices.

- **Examples**:
  - `solution([5, 8, 7, 1])` returns `12`
  - `solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3])` returns `9`
  - `solution([30, 13, 24, 321])` returns `0`

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies. It is implemented in pure Python, and you can run it in any standard Python environment.

### Quick Install

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file to your local machine.

3. No additional installation steps are required as there are no external dependencies.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

3. Run the Python interpreter and import the `solution` function:

   ```bash
   python
   ```

   ```python
   from main import solution
   ```

4. Use the `solution` function by passing a list of integers as an argument:

   ```python
   result = solution([5, 8, 7, 1])
   print(result)  # Output: 12
   ```

5. You can test the function with different lists to see how it works with various inputs.

## Documentation

For further details on how the function works, refer to the docstring provided in the `main.py` file. It includes a brief description, parameter details, return type, and example usage.

## Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions about the software, please contact our support team at support@chatdev.com. We are here to help you with any inquiries or technical support you may need.
