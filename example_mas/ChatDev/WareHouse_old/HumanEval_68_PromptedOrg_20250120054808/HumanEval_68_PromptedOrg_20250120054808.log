    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To solve the task, we need to implement the `pluck` function in Python. This function will iterate through the given array, identify the smallest even value, and return it along with its index. If there are no even values or the array is empty, it will return an empty list.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the implementation:

1. **Function Definition**: Define the function `pluck(arr)` which takes a list of non-negative integers as input.

2. **Initialize Variables**: Set up variables to keep track of the smallest even value and its index. Initially, these can be set to `None` or a placeholder value.

3. **Iterate Through the Array**: Loop through the array to check each element:
   - If the element is even, compare it with the current smallest even value.
   - If it's smaller, update the smallest even value and its index.
   - If it's equal to the current smallest even value, ensure the index is the smallest.

4. **Return the Result**: After the loop, check if a smallest even value was found. If so, return it and its index in a list. If not, return an empty list.

Now, let's implement this in the `main.py` file.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `pluck` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

The Programmer's assessment is correct. The provided code in `main.py` does not utilize any external libraries or packages; it solely relies on Python's built-in functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, indicating that there are no additional dependencies needed for this project.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

If there are any changes or additional features in the future that require external libraries, the `requirements.txt` file should be updated accordingly to include those dependencies.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

# Pluck Function User Manual

Welcome to the user manual for the `pluck` function. This document will guide you through the main features of the software, how to install it, and how to use it effectively.

## Overview

The `pluck` function is designed to process an array of non-negative integer nodes, representing a branch of a tree. The function identifies and returns the node with the smallest even value. If multiple nodes have the same smallest even value, the function returns the node with the smallest index. If there are no even values or the array is empty, the function returns an empty list.

### Main Features

- **Identify Smallest Even Node**: The function finds the smallest even node in the array.
- **Return Node with Smallest Index**: In case of ties, it returns the node with the smallest index.
- **Handles Empty Arrays**: If the array is empty or contains no even numbers, it returns an empty list.

## Installation

The `pluck` function is a standalone Python function and does not require any external dependencies. You can simply copy the function into your Python script and use it. There is no need to install any additional packages.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

To use the `pluck` function, follow these steps:

1. **Copy the Function**: Copy the `pluck` function code into your Python script.

2. **Call the Function**: Pass an array of non-negative integers to the function.

3. **Receive Output**: The function will return a list containing the smallest even value and its index, or an empty list if no even values are found.

### Example Usage

```python
def pluck(arr):
    # Initialize variables to track the smallest even value and its index
    smallest_even = None
    smallest_index = None
    # Iterate through the array
    for index, value in enumerate(arr):
        # Check if the value is even
        if value % 2 == 0:
            # If it's the first even number or smaller than the current smallest even
            if smallest_even is None or value < smallest_even:
                smallest_even = value
                smallest_index = index
    # If a smallest even value was found, return it with its index
    if smallest_even is not None:
        return [smallest_even, smallest_index]
    # If no even value was found, return an empty list
    return []

# Example 1
print(pluck([4, 2, 3]))  # Output: [2, 1]

# Example 2
print(pluck([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [2, 1]

# Example 3
print(pluck([]))  # Output: []

# Example 4
print(pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

## Conclusion

The `pluck` function is a simple yet effective tool for identifying the smallest even node in an array of non-negative integers. With no external dependencies, it is easy to integrate into your Python projects. Simply copy the function and start using it to process your data.
