We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To complete the task, we need to implement the `decode_cyclic` function, which will reverse the encoding process done by the `encode_cyclic` function. The `encode_cyclic` function cycles groups of three characters by moving the first character to the end of the group. The `decode_cyclic` function should reverse this process by moving the last character of each group to the front.

Let's outline the necessary components:

1. **Function: `encode_cyclic`**  
   - Purpose: Encodes a string by cycling groups of three characters.

2. **Function: `decode_cyclic`**  
   - Purpose: Decodes a string that was encoded with the `encode_cyclic` function by reversing the cycling process.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python
'''

This module provides functions to encode and decode strings by cycling groups of three characters.

'''

def encode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    Returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.
    """
    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)


def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    Takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # reverse cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)
```

This code defines both the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions. The `decode_cyclic` function reverses the encoding process by taking the last character of each group of three and moving it to the front. This ensures that the original string can be accurately reconstructed from its encoded form.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses standard Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
```
This empty file signifies that the project does not require any external libraries or dependencies beyond the standard Python library. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Cyclic Encoder/Decoder

This software provides functions to encode and decode strings by cycling groups of three characters. It is implemented in Python and consists of two main functions: `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`.

## Main Functions

### encode_cyclic(s: str)

- **Description**: This function takes a string `s` as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. If the group has fewer than three characters, it remains unchanged.
- **Usage**: 
  ```python
  encoded_string = encode_cyclic("abcdef")
  print(encoded_string)  # Output: "bcadef"
  ```

### decode_cyclic(s: str)

- **Description**: This function takes an encoded string `s` (encoded using the `encode_cyclic` function) as input and returns the original decoded string.
- **Usage**: 
  ```python
  decoded_string = decode_cyclic("bcadef")
  print(decoded_string)  # Output: "abcdef"
  ```

## Installation

### Environment Setup

To use this software, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

# Cyclic Encoder/Decoder

This software provides functions to encode and decode strings by cycling groups of three characters. It is implemented in Python and consists of two main functions: `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`.

## Main Functions

### encode_cyclic(s: str)

- **Description**: This function takes a string `s` as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. If the group has fewer than three characters, it remains unchanged.
- **Usage**: 
  ```python
  encoded_string = encode_cyclic("abcdef")
  print(encoded_string)  # Output: "bcadef"
  ```

### decode_cyclic(s: str)

- **Description**: This function takes an encoded string `s` (encoded using the `encode_cyclic` function) as input and returns the original decoded string.
- **Usage**: 
  ```python
  decoded_string = decode_cyclic("bcadef")
  print(decoded_string)  # Output: "abcdef"
  ```
