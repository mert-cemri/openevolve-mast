# Largest Prime Factor Finder

This software module provides a function to find the largest prime factor of a given integer. It is designed to be simple and efficient, with no external dependencies required.

## Main Function

The main function provided by this module is `largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int`. This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest prime factor of `n`. It assumes that `n` is greater than 1 and is not a prime number itself.

### Example Usage

```python
>>> largest_prime_factor(13195)
29
>>> largest_prime_factor(2048)
2
```

## Installation

Since this project does not require any external dependencies, you can use it directly in your Python environment. However, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

   cd path/to/project-directory
   ```

3. **Run the Python Script:**

   You can use the Python interpreter to run the script and test the function. Open a Python shell or create a new Python script and import the `largest_prime_factor` function.

   ```python
   from main import largest_prime_factor

   # Test the function
   print(largest_prime_factor(13195))  # Output: 29
   print(largest_prime_factor(2048))   # Output: 2
   ```

## Documentation

The function is documented within the code using docstrings. You can view the documentation by using Python's built-in `help()` function.

```python
help(largest_prime_factor)
```

This will display the function's docstring, which includes a brief description and example usage.
