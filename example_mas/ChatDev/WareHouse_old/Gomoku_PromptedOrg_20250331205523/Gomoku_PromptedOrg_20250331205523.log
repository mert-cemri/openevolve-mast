Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of ChatDev. Your primary responsibilities include overseeing all technical aspects of the company. You establish the company's technical vision and lead technological development, ensuring that technology resources align with the company's business needs.
You report to the CEO and collaborate with other executives to integrate technology into the company's strategy.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a standard Gomoku game. Implement it on a typical 15x15 board, where two players alternate placing black or white stones. A player wins by forming an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally..
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

Core Classes and Functions:

1. Class GomokuGame:
   - Purpose: Manages the game state, board, player turns, and checks for winning conditions.
   - Methods:
     - __init__: Initializes the game board and sets the first player.
     - display_board: Prints the current state of the board.
     - place_stone: Places a stone on the board if the position is valid.
     - check_win: Checks if the current move resulted in a win.
     - is_full: Checks if the board is full (draw condition).
     - switch_player: Switches the current player.

2. Function main:
   - Purpose: Entry point of the application, manages game loop and user interaction.

Now, let's implement the code files:

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a standard Gomoku game. Implement it on a typical 15x15 board, where two players alternate placing black or white stones. A player wins by forming an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The highest priority issue identified:

The current implementation does not handle the scenario where a player attempts to place a stone on a cell that is already occupied or out of bounds clearly enough. Although the `place_stone` method returns `False` in such cases, the user experience could be improved by explicitly informing the user about the specific reason (cell occupied or out of bounds).

Suggestion for revision:

Modify the `place_stone` method in `gomoku.py` to provide detailed feedback on why a move is invalid. For example:

```python
def place_stone(self, row, col):
    if not (0 <= row < self.size and 0 <= col < self.size):
        print("Move out of bounds. Please enter valid coordinates.")
        return False
    if self.board[row][col] != '.':
        print("Cell already occupied. Please choose another cell.")
        return False
    self.board[row][col] = self.current_player
    return True
```

This change will enhance user interaction by clearly indicating the reason for invalid moves, thus improving the overall user experience.

Comments on Codes:
"The highest priority issue identified:

The current implementation does not handle the scenario where a player attempts to place a stone on a cell that is already occupied or out of bounds clearly enough. Although the `place_stone` method returns `False` in such cases, the user experience could be improved by explicitly informing the user about the specific reason (cell occupied or out of bounds).

Modify the `place_stone` method in `gomoku.py` to provide detailed feedback on why a move is invalid. For example:

```python
def place_stone(self, row, col):
    if not (0 <= row < self.size and 0 <= col < self.size):
        print("Move out of bounds. Please enter valid coordinates.")
        return False
    if self.board[row][col] != '.':
        print("Cell already occupied. Please choose another cell.")
        return False
    self.board[row][col] = self.current_player
    return True
```

This change will enhance user interaction by clearly indicating the reason for invalid moves, thus improving the overall user experience."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Gomoku Game

A simple and interactive Gomoku game implemented in Python. Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, is a strategic board game traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a 15x15 board. The objective is to be the first player to form an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Standard 15x15 Gomoku board.
- Two-player interactive gameplay.
- Automatic win detection.
- Clear and intuitive command-line interface.
- Input validation and error handling.

---

## 📋 Requirements

This Gomoku game is implemented entirely in Python and does not require any external dependencies.

### Python Version

- Python 3.x (recommended Python 3.6 or later)

---

## ⚙️ Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository or download the source code files (`gomoku.py` and `main.py`) to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

Alternatively, manually download and save the provided files (`gomoku.py` and `main.py`) into a dedicated directory.

### Step 2: Set Up the Environment

Since there are no external dependencies, you only need Python installed on your system. Verify your Python installation by running:

```bash
python --version
```

If Python is not installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

---

## 🎮 How to Play

### Starting the Game

Navigate to the directory containing the game files and run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Gameplay Instructions

1. **Game Start**: The game begins with Player B (Black stones) making the first move.
2. **Making a Move**: Players alternate turns placing their stones on the board. To place a stone, enter the row and column numbers separated by a space when prompted.

Example input:

```
Enter row and column (separated by space): 7 7
```

3. **Rules**:
   - You cannot place a stone on an occupied cell.
   - Moves must be within the bounds of the 15x15 board (rows and columns numbered from 0 to 14).

4. **Winning the Game**: The first player to form an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

5. **Draw Condition**: If all cells are occupied and no player has formed a row of five stones, the game ends in a draw.

---

## 📖 Game Interface

The game board is displayed in the terminal after each move. The board uses the following symbols:

- `.` : Empty cell
- `B` : Black stone (Player B)
- `W` : White stone (Player W)

Example of the board display:

```
    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14

14  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
```

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **Invalid Input**: If you enter invalid coordinates or non-integer values, the game will prompt you to re-enter valid coordinates.
- **Occupied Cell**: If you attempt to place a stone on an already occupied cell, you will be prompted to choose another cell.
- **Out of Bounds**: If you enter coordinates outside the 0-14 range, you will be prompted to enter valid coordinates.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **Invalid Input**: If you enter invalid coordinates or non-integer values, the game will prompt you to re-enter valid coordinates.
- **Occupied Cell**: If you attempt to place a stone on an already occupied cell, you will be prompted to choose another cell.
- **Out of Bounds**: If you enter coordinates outside the 0-14 range, you will be prompted to enter valid coordinates.
