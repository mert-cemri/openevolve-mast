# Unique Function

A simple Python utility to return sorted unique elements from a list.

## Introduction

The `unique` function is designed to take a list of elements and return a new list containing only the unique elements, sorted in ascending order. This can be particularly useful for data processing tasks where duplicate entries need to be removed and the data needs to be sorted.

## Main Functionality

- **unique(l: list) -> list**: This function takes a list `l` as input and returns a list of sorted unique elements.

### Example

```python
>>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
```

## Quick Install

This project does not require any external dependencies, so you can run the code directly with Python installed on your system.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Move into the directory where the `main.py` file is located.

   ```bash
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Run the Code**: You can run the `main.py` file using Python to test the `unique` function.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Use the Function**: You can import the `unique` function into your own Python scripts and use it as needed.

   ```python
   from main import unique

   result = unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
   print(result)  # Output: [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
   ```

## Documentation

The function is straightforward and does not require additional configuration. For any further questions or issues, please refer to the code comments and docstrings within the `main.py` file.
