Given the task at hand, which involves writing a piece of software code to solve a specific problem, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a functional piece of code, which aligns with the capabilities of an application that can execute and demonstrate the solution. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" is indeed the most appropriate product modality for this task, as it involves writing and executing a piece of software code to solve a specific problem. This aligns well with the nature of an application, which can implement and demonstrate the functionality of the code. Let's proceed with this modality.

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `minSubArraySum` that finds the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array of a given list of integers. Since the task explicitly states not to implement a GUI interface or anything redundant, we will focus solely on the logic required to solve the problem.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Function Definition**: Define the function `minSubArraySum` that takes a list of integers as input.
2. **Algorithm**: Use a variation of Kadane's algorithm to find the minimum sub-array sum. This involves iterating through the array while maintaining a running sum and updating the minimum sum encountered.
3. **Return Value**: The function should return the minimum sum found.

Let's implement the code in the `main.py` file:

FILENAME

```python
'''
This file contains the implementation of the function to find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array of a given list of integers.
'''

def minSubArraySum(nums):
    """
    Given an array of integers nums, find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array
    of nums.
    Example
    minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]) == 1
    minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]) == -6
    """
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    min_sum = float('inf')
    current_sum = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        current_sum += num
        if current_sum < min_sum:
            min_sum = current_sum
        if current_sum > 0:
            current_sum = 0
    
    return min_sum
```

This code defines the `minSubArraySum` function, which uses a simple loop to calculate the minimum sub-array sum. It keeps track of the current sum and updates the minimum sum whenever a smaller sum is found. If the current sum becomes positive, it is reset to zero to ensure that only negative sums are considered for the minimum sub-array sum.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required since the function `minSubArraySum` only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty as there are no additional libraries needed for the project to run properly.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required

# MinSubArraySum

A simple Python application to find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array from a given list of integers.

## Introduction

The `minSubArraySum` function is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array within a list of integers. This function is useful in scenarios where you need to determine the smallest possible sum that can be obtained from contiguous elements in an array.

### Main Function

- **minSubArraySum(nums):** 
  - **Input:** A list of integers `nums`.
  - **Output:** An integer representing the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array of `nums`.
  - **Example Usage:**
    ```python
    print(minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]))  # Output: 1
    print(minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]))        # Output: -6

# MinSubArraySum

A simple Python application to find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array from a given list of integers.

## Introduction

The `minSubArraySum` function is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array within a list of integers. This function is useful in scenarios where you need to determine the smallest possible sum that can be obtained from contiguous elements in an array.

### Main Function

- **minSubArraySum(nums):** 
  - **Input:** A list of integers `nums`.
  - **Output:** An integer representing the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array of `nums`.
  - **Example Usage:**
    ```python
    print(minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]))  # Output: 1
    print(minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]))        # Output: -6
    ```
