Given the nature of the task, which is to create a Rock-Paper-Scissors game, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application." This would allow us to implement the game with interactive features and visualizations, providing a user-friendly experience. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Create a Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The user chooses one option, and the computer randomly picks one. Compare results using the usual rules (Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock). Display the outcome and allow replay.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To implement the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, we will create a simple Python application with the following structure:

1. **Classes and Functions:**
   - `Game`: A class to encapsulate the game logic.
     - `__init__`: Initializes the game.
     - `get_user_choice`: Prompts the user to enter their choice.
     - `get_computer_choice`: Randomly selects a choice for the computer.
     - `determine_winner`: Compares the user's choice and the computer's choice to determine the winner.
     - `play`: Manages the game flow, including replay functionality.

2. **Main Execution:**
   - The main script will create an instance of the `Game` class and call its `play` method to start the game.

Now, let's implement the code in a single file named `rock_paper_scissors.py`.

rock_paper_scissors.py

```python

'''

This module implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user plays against the computer.
The user chooses one option, and the computer randomly picks one. The game compares results using the usual rules:
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock
The outcome is displayed, and the user can choose to replay the game.

import random

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]

    def get_user_choice(self):
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): ").lower()
        while user_choice not in self.choices:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): ").lower()
        return user_choice

    def get_computer_choice(self):
        return random.choice(self.choices)

    def determine_winner(self, user_choice, computer_choice):
        if user_choice == computer_choice:
            return "It's a tie!"
        elif (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
             (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper") or \
             (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock"):
            return "You win!"
        else:
            return "Computer wins!"

    def play(self):
        while True:
            user_choice = self.get_user_choice()
            computer_choice = self.get_computer_choice()
            print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}")
            result = self.determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
            print(result)
            replay = input("Do you want to play again? (yes/no): ").lower()
            if replay != "yes":
                print("Thanks for playing!")
                break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    game = Game()
    game.play()

```

This code defines a `Game` class that handles the logic for playing Rock-Paper-Scissors. The `play` method manages the game loop, allowing the user to play multiple rounds until they choose to exit. The game uses standard input and output for user interaction.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

Based on the provided code for the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, the only external library used is the `random` module, which is part of Python's standard library and does not need to be listed in a `requirements.txt` file. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no additional dependencies required.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

If you plan to expand the project in the future and include additional libraries, you would list them in this file with their respective versions.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation
