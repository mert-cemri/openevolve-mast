def unique(l: list):

    """
.
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To complete the task, we need to implement the `unique` function that returns sorted unique elements from a list. Since the task is straightforward and does not require multiple files or complex architecture, we will implement this function in a single file named `main.py`.

Here is the plan:

1. **Function Name**: `unique`
   - **Purpose**: To return a list of sorted unique elements from the input list.
   - **Input**: A list of integers.
   - **Output**: A list of sorted unique integers.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python

'''

Return sorted unique elements in a list.

'''

def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list
    >>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
    """
    return sorted(set(l))

```

This code defines the `unique` function, which uses Python's `set` to remove duplicates and `sorted` to sort the resulting unique elements. The function is simple and efficient for the given task.

# Unique Function User Manual

This document serves as a user manual for the `unique` function, which is designed to return sorted unique elements from a list. This function is implemented in Python and is intended for use in applications where deduplication and sorting of list elements are required.

## Main Functionality

The primary function provided by this software is:

- **unique(l: list):** This function takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements from `l`, sorted in ascending order.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import unique

# Example list
example_list = [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]

# Get sorted unique elements
result = unique(example_list)
