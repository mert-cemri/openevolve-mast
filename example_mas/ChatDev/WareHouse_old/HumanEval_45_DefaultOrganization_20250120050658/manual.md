# Triangle Area Calculator

This software provides a simple function to calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height. It is implemented in Python and requires no external dependencies.

## Quick Install

Since there are no external dependencies for this project, you can simply download the `main.py` file and run it using Python.

## 🤔 What is this?

This software is a straightforward utility for calculating the area of a triangle. It is designed to be minimalistic and efficient, focusing solely on the task of computing the area given the base and height.

### Main Function

- **`triangle_area(a, h)`**: This function takes two parameters:
  - `a`: The length of the base of the triangle.
  - `h`: The height of the triangle.
  
  It returns the area of the triangle calculated using the formula: 
  \[
  \text{Area} = 0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
  \]

  **Example Usage**:
  ```python
  >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
  7.5
  ```

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Download the Code**: Obtain the `main.py` file which contains the function definition.

2. **Run the Code**: Use Python to execute the function. You can do this by importing the function into your Python script or interactive session.

   ```python
   from main import triangle_area

   # Example usage
   area = triangle_area(5, 3)
   print(f"The area of the triangle is: {area}")
   ```

3. **Modify as Needed**: You can modify the function to suit your specific needs, such as integrating it into a larger application or adjusting the input/output format.

## Additional Information

- **No External Libraries**: This project does not require any additional Python packages beyond the standard library.
- **Python Version**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This code is compatible with Python 3.x.
