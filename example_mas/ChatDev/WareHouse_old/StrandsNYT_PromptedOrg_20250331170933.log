**task_prompt**: Implement a version of the NYT Strands puzzle. Strands is a word search game within a 6x8 grid of letters which players use to uncover words falling under a theme. The board must be filled entirely to complete the puzzle - no words will overlap. Each game includes a challenge word called the "spangram" that touches two opposite sides of the board. Themed words will highlight blue; the spangram will highlight yellow. Words can be formed by connecting adjacent letters in any direction (vertically, horizontally, diagonally) and can change direction mid-word. Players can find non-theme words to earn hints. Every 3 non-theme words will unlock a hint! The puzzle must be fully completed by finding all theme words and filling the board.
