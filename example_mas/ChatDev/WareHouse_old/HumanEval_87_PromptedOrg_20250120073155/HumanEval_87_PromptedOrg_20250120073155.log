To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To solve the task, we need to implement the `get_row` function in Python. This function will take a 2D list and an integer `x`, and return a list of tuples representing the coordinates of `x` in the list. The coordinates should be sorted by rows in ascending order and by columns in descending order within each row.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Iterate through each row** of the 2D list.
2. **Check each element** in the row to see if it matches `x`.
3. **Record the coordinates** (row index, column index) for each match.
4. **Sort the coordinates** first by row index in ascending order, then by column index in descending order for each row.
5. **Return the sorted list** of coordinates.

Now, let's implement this in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

    ], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]
    get_row([], 1) == []
    get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]
    """
    coordinates = []
    
    # Iterate over each row in the list
    for row_index, row in enumerate(lst):
        # Find all occurrences of x in the current row
        for col_index, value in enumerate(row):
            if value == x:
                coordinates.append((row_index, col_index))
    
    # Sort the coordinates by row in ascending order and by column in descending order
    coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))
    
    return coordinates

This code should fulfill the task requirements by correctly identifying and sorting the coordinates of the integer `x` in the given 2D list.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

# User Manual for `get_row` Function

## Introduction

The `get_row` function is a Python utility designed to search through a two-dimensional list (a list of lists) and find all occurrences of a specified integer. It returns the coordinates of these occurrences as a list of tuples. Each tuple represents the position of the integer in the format (row, column), with indexing starting at 0. The function sorts these coordinates by row in ascending order and by column in descending order.

## Main Functionality

- **Function Name:** `get_row`
- **Purpose:** To find all occurrences of a specified integer in a 2D list and return their coordinates.
- **Input Parameters:**
  - `lst`: A list of lists, where each sublist represents a row of data.
  - `x`: An integer to search for within the 2D list.
- **Output:** A list of tuples, where each tuple contains the row and column indices of the integer `x` in the 2D list.

## Installation

This project does not require any external dependencies, so there is no need to install additional packages. You only need Python installed on your system to run the function.

## Usage

To use the `get_row` function, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Python is Installed:**
   Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Create a Python Script:**
   Create a new Python file (e.g., `main.py`) and copy the `get_row` function code into this file.

3. **Call the Function:**
   Use the function by passing a 2D list and the integer you want to search for. For example:

   ```python
   def get_row(lst, x):
       coordinates = []
       for row_index, row in enumerate(lst):
           for col_index, value in enumerate(row):
               if value == x:
                   coordinates.append((row_index, col_index))
       coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))
       return coordinates

   # Example usage
   result = get_row([
       [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
       [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6],
       [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
   ], 1)
   print(result)  # Output: [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]
   ```

4. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the script using a Python interpreter. You can run it from the command line by navigating to the directory containing your script and typing:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example

Here is an example of how the function works:

- **Input:**
  ```python
  get_row([
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6],
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
  ], 1)
  ```

- **Output:**
  ```
  [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]
  ```

This output indicates that the integer `1` is found at the coordinates (0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), and (2, 0) in the provided 2D list.

## Conclusion

The `get_row` function is a simple yet effective tool for locating integers within a 2D list and returning their positions in a structured and sorted manner. It is easy to integrate into any Python project that requires such functionality.

 # User Manual for `get_row` Function

## Introduction

The `get_row` function is a Python utility designed to search through a two-dimensional list (a list of lists) and find all occurrences of a specified integer. It returns the coordinates of these occurrences as a list of tuples. Each tuple represents the position of the integer in the format (row, column), with indexing starting at 0. The function sorts these coordinates by row in ascending order and by column in descending order.

## Main Functionality

- **Function Name:** `get_row`
- **Purpose:** To find all occurrences of a specified integer in a 2D list and return their coordinates.
- **Input Parameters:**
  - `lst`: A list of lists, where each sublist represents a row of data.
  - `x`: An integer to search for within the 2D list.
- **Output:** A list of tuples, where each tuple contains the row and column indices of the integer `x` in the 2D list.

## Installation

       coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))
       return coordinates

   # Example usage
   result = get_row([
       [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
       [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6],
       [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
   ], 1)
   print(result)  # Output: [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]
   ```

4. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the script using a Python interpreter. You can run it from the command line by navigating to the directory containing your script and typing:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example

Here is an example of how the function works:

- **Input:**
  ```python
  get_row([
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6],
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
  ], 1)
  ```

- **Output:**
  ```
  [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]
  ```

This output indicates that the integer `1` is found at the coordinates (0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), and (2, 0) in the provided 2D list.

## Conclusion

The `get_row` function is a simple yet effective tool for locating integers within a 2D list and returning their positions in a structured and sorted manner. It is easy to integrate into any Python project that requires such functionality.
