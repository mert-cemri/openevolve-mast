As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To solve the task, we need to implement the `count_nums` function in Python. This function will take an array of integers and return the number of elements for which the sum of its digits is greater than 0. The function should handle both positive and negative numbers correctly.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Function Name**: `count_nums`
   - **Purpose**: To count the number of integers in an array whose sum of digits is greater than 0.

2. **Helper Function**: `sum_of_digits`
   - **Purpose**: To calculate the sum of digits of a given integer, considering the sign of the first digit if the number is negative.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Iterate over each number in the input array.
   - For each number, calculate the sum of its digits using the helper function.
   - Count how many numbers have a sum of digits greater than 0.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

```python

    >>> count_nums([]) == 0
    >>> count_nums([-1, 11, -11]) == 1
    >>> count_nums([1, 1, 2]) == 3
    """
    def sum_of_digits(n):
        # Convert number to string to iterate over digits
        str_n = str(n)
        # Initialize sum of digits
        total = 0
        # Check if the number is negative
        if str_n[0] == '-':
            # Add the first digit as negative
            total += int(str_n[0:2])
            # Start from the third character
            str_n = str_n[2:]
        # Add the rest of the digits
        for char in str_n:
            total += int(char)
        return total

    # Count numbers with sum of digits > 0
    count = 0
    for num in arr:
        if sum_of_digits(num) > 0:
            count += 1
    return count

```

This code defines the `count_nums` function and a helper function `sum_of_digits` to calculate the sum of digits of each number in the array. The main function iterates over the array, uses the helper function to determine the sum of digits for each number, and counts how many numbers have a sum greater than 0.

This code defines the `count_nums` function and a helper function `sum_of_digits` to calculate the sum of digits of each number in the array. The main function iterates over the array, uses the helper function to determine the sum of digits for each number, and counts how many numbers have a sum greater than 0.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# Count Nums User Manual

Welcome to the Count Nums software! This application is designed to help you count the number of integers in an array whose sum of digits is greater than 0. This manual will guide you through the installation process, introduce the main function of the software, and provide instructions on how to use it.

## Main Functionality

The primary function of this software is `count_nums`, which takes an array of integers as input and returns the number of elements in the array for which the sum of digits is greater than 0. The function handles both positive and negative integers, considering the first digit of a negative number as negative.

### Example Usage

- `count_nums([])` returns `0`
- `count_nums([-1, 11, -11])` returns `1`
- `count_nums([1, 1, 2])` returns `3`

## Installation

### Prerequisites

To run this software, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Quick Install

Since there are no additional dependencies required for this software, you can directly use the provided Python script without any additional installations.

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   You can clone the repository containing the `main.py` file to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository.

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**

   Change your working directory to the location where the `main.py` file is located:

   ```bash
   cd <directory-name>
   ```

   Replace `<directory-name>` with the actual name of the directory.

## How to Use

1. **Open the `main.py` file:**

   Use any text editor or IDE to open the `main.py` file.

2. **Run the Script:**

   You can run the script using the Python interpreter. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file, and execute the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Modify the Code:**

   If you want to test the function with different inputs, you can modify the `main.py` file to include test cases or use an interactive Python shell to call the `count_nums` function with your desired input.

## Documentation

For further information and detailed documentation, please refer to the comments within the `main.py` file. The comments provide a clear explanation of the function's logic and usage.

We hope this manual helps you effectively use the Count Nums software. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to reach out to our support team.
