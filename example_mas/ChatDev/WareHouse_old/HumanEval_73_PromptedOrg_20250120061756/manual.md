# Palindromic Array Transformation

This software provides a function to determine the minimum number of changes required to transform an array of integers into a palindromic array. A palindromic array is one that reads the same forwards and backwards.

## Main Function

### `smallest_change(arr)`

- **Description**: This function calculates the minimum number of elements that need to be changed in an array to make it palindromic.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `arr`: A list of integers.
- **Returns**: An integer representing the minimum number of changes required.

#### Example Usage

```python
print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6]))  # Output: 4
print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]))    # Output: 1
print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]))          # Output: 0
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or download the `main.py` file to your local machine.

2. **Run the script** using Python. No additional installation steps are necessary.

```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Use

1. **Prepare your environment**: Ensure Python is installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Run the function**: You can directly call the `smallest_change` function from within a Python script or an interactive Python session.

3. **Input your array**: Pass the array of integers you want to analyze as an argument to the function.

4. **Get the result**: The function will return the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic.
