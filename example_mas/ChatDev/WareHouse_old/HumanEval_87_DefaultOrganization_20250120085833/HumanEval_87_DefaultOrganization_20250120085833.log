Given the task at hand, which involves writing a piece of software code to solve a specific problem, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a functional piece of code, which aligns with the capabilities of an application that can execute and demonstrate the solution. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" is indeed the most appropriate product modality for this task, as it involves writing and executing a piece of software code to solve a specific problem. This aligns well with the nature of an application, which is designed to implement and demonstrate functional code.

You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To solve the task, we need to implement the function `get_row` in Python. The function will take a 2D list and an integer `x`, and return a list of tuples representing the coordinates of `x` in the list. The coordinates should be sorted by rows in ascending order and by columns in descending order within each row.

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Definition**: Define the function `get_row(lst, x)` that takes a list of lists `lst` and an integer `x`.

2. **Initialize Result List**: Create an empty list `coordinates` to store the coordinates of `x`.

3. **Iterate Over Rows**: Use a loop to iterate over each row in `lst` with its index.

4. **Iterate Over Columns**: For each row, use another loop to iterate over each element with its index.

5. **Check for x**: If an element equals `x`, append its coordinates (row index, column index) to `coordinates`.

6. **Sort Coordinates**: First, sort the coordinates by row index in ascending order. Then, for each row, sort the coordinates by column index in descending order.

7. **Return Result**: Return the sorted list of coordinates.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

main.py

```python
def get_row(lst, x):
    """
    You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists,
    which is similar to matrix, however, unlike matrices,
    each row may contain a different number of columns.
    Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list,
    and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that
    each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0.
    Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order.
    Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.
    
    Examples:
    get_row([
      [1,2,3,4,5,6],
      [1,2,3,4,1,6],
      [1,2,3,4,5,1]
    ], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]
    get_row([], 1) == []
    get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]
    """
    coordinates = []
    
    for row_index, row in enumerate(lst):
        for col_index, value in enumerate(row):
            if value == x:
                coordinates.append((row_index, col_index))
    
    # Sort by row index ascending, then by column index descending
    coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))
    
    return coordinates
```

This code will correctly find all occurrences of `x` in the 2D list `lst`, and return the coordinates sorted as specified.

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Definition**: Define the function `get_row(lst, x)` that takes a list of lists `lst` and an integer `x`.

2. **Initialize Result List**: Create an empty list `coordinates` to store the coordinates of `x`.

3. **Iterate Over Rows**: Use a loop to iterate over each row in `lst` with its index.

4. **Iterate Over Columns**: For each row, use another loop to iterate over each element with its index.

5. **Check for x**: If an element equals `x`, append its coordinates (row index, column index) to `coordinates`.

6. **Sort Coordinates**: First, sort the coordinates by row index in ascending order. Then, for each row, sort the coordinates by column index in descending order.

7. **Return Result**: Return the sorted list of coordinates.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

main.py

```python
def get_row(lst, x):
    """
    You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists,
    which is similar to matrix, however, unlike matrices,
    each row may contain a different number of columns.
    Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list,
    and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that
    each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0.
    Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order.
    Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.
    
    Examples:
    get_row([
      [1,2,3,4,5,6],
      [1,2,3,4,1,6],
      [1,2,3,4,5,1]
    ], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]
    get_row([], 1) == []
    get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]
    """
    coordinates = []
    
    for row_index, row in enumerate(lst):
        for col_index, value in enumerate(row):
            if value == x:
                coordinates.append((row_index, col_index))
    
    # Sort by row index ascending, then by column index descending
    coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))
    
    return coordinates
```

This code will correctly find all occurrences of `x` in the 2D list `lst`, and return the coordinates sorted as specified.

# User Manual for `get_row` Function

## Introduction

The `get_row` function is a Python utility designed to work with 2-dimensional data represented as nested lists. Unlike traditional matrices, each row in this data structure may contain a different number of columns. The primary function of `get_row` is to locate all occurrences of a specified integer within this data structure and return their coordinates in a specific order.

## Main Functionality

### `get_row(lst, x)`

- **Purpose**: To find all occurrences of an integer `x` in a 2-dimensional list `lst` and return their coordinates.
- **Input**:
  - `lst`: A list of lists (2D data structure) where each sublist represents a row.
  - `x`: An integer value to search for within the 2D list.
- **Output**: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents the coordinates `(row_index, column_index)` of an occurrence of `x`. The coordinates are sorted by row index in ascending order and by column index in descending order within each row.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example 1
result = get_row([
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6],
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
], 1)
print(result)  # Output: [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]

# Example 2

 # User Manual for `get_row` Function

## Introduction

The `get_row` function is a Python utility designed to work with 2-dimensional data represented as nested lists. Unlike traditional matrices, each row in this data structure may contain a different number of columns. The primary function of `get_row` is to locate all occurrences of a specified integer within this data structure and return their coordinates in a specific order.

## Main Functionality

### `get_row(lst, x)`

- **Purpose**: To find all occurrences of an integer `x` in a 2-dimensional list `lst` and return their coordinates.
- **Input**:
  - `lst`: A list of lists (2D data structure) where each sublist represents a row.
  - `x`: An integer value to search for within the 2D list.
- **Output**: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents the coordinates `(row_index, column_index)` of an occurrence of `x`. The coordinates are sorted by row index in ascending order and by column index in descending order within each row.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example 1
result = get_row([
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6],
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
], 1)
print(result)  # Output: [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]

# Example 2
result = get_row([], 1)
print(result)  # Output: []

# Example 3
result = get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3)
print(result)  # Output: [(2, 2)]
```
