Given the task is to write a piece of software code that processes a list of integers to generate a list of rolling maximums, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task involves implementing a software tool or function, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" is indeed the most suitable product modality for implementing a software tool or function like the one described in the task. It allows us to focus on the code functionality without unnecessary interfaces.

To solve the task, we need to implement the `rolling_max` function in Python. This function will take a list of integers as input and return a list where each element is the maximum value encountered in the list up to that point.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Function Definition**: Define the function `rolling_max` that accepts a list of integers.
2. **Initialize Variables**: Create an empty list to store the rolling maximum values and a variable to keep track of the current maximum.
3. **Iterate Through the List**: Loop through each number in the input list.
4. **Update Maximum**: For each number, update the current maximum if the number is greater than the current maximum.
5. **Append to Result**: Append the current maximum to the result list.
6. **Return Result**: After the loop, return the result list containing the rolling maximums.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file:

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains the implementation of the rolling_max function which generates a list of rolling maximum elements from a given list of integers.

'''

from typing import List

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment
    in the sequence.
    >>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    """
    if not numbers:
        return []
    
    result = []
    current_max = numbers[0]
    
    for number in numbers:
        if number > current_max:
            current_max = number
        result.append(current_max)
    
    return result
```

This code defines the `rolling_max` function, which processes the input list to generate a list of rolling maximums. The function iterates through the list, updating the current maximum as needed and appending it to the result list. The function is designed to handle an empty list by returning an empty list immediately.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Since the provided code for the `rolling_max` function does not use any external libraries or packages, the `requirements.txt` file for this project will be empty. This indicates that there are no additional dependencies needed for the project to run properly.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```

# Rolling Max Function User Manual

This manual provides detailed instructions on how to use the `rolling_max` function, which is designed to generate a list of rolling maximum elements from a given list of integers.

## Overview

The `rolling_max` function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list where each element is the maximum value found in the input list up to that point. This function is useful for applications where you need to track the maximum value in a sequence of numbers as it progresses.

### Example

```python
>>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
```

## Installation

To use the `rolling_max` function, you need to have Python installed on your system. The function does not require any external libraries, so there are no additional dependencies to install.

### Quick Install

1. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or Download the Code**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the `rolling_max` function. You can clone the repository or download the file directly.

## Usage

1. **Import the Function**: Ensure that the `rolling_max` function is accessible in your Python environment. You can do this by placing the `main.py` file in your working directory and importing the function.

   ```python
   from main import rolling_max
   ```

2. **Call the Function**: Pass a list of integers to the `rolling_max` function to get the rolling maximum values.

   ```python
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]
   result = rolling_max(numbers)
   print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
   ```

## Function Details

- **Function Name**: `rolling_max`
- **Input**: A list of integers (`List[int]`)
- **Output**: A list of integers representing the rolling maximum values (`List[int]`)

## Documentation

For further details and examples, refer to the docstring within the `rolling_max` function in the `main.py` file. The docstring provides a concise explanation of the function's purpose and usage.

## Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions about using the `rolling_max` function, please reach out to our support team for assistance. We are here to help you make the most of this functionality in your applications.
