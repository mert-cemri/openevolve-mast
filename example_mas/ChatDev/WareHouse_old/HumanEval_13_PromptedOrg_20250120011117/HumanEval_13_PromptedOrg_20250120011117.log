Given the task is to write a piece of software code to solve a specific problem, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to focus on developing the necessary code functionality without any additional presentation or visualization requirements. What are your thoughts on this?

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

.
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To solve the task, we need to implement the `greatest_common_divisor` function in Python. This function will calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm, which is efficient and straightforward for this purpose.

### Core Function:
- **greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int**: This function will take two integers as input and return their greatest common divisor.

Now, let's write the code for the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.

'''

def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """ Return the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
    1
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
    5
    """
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

This code implements the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces the larger number by the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

For the given code, which calculates the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code relies solely on Python's built-in functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed for this project.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

```
```

This empty file signifies that the project does not require any external Python packages to run.

The Programmer's assessment is correct. The code provided for calculating the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm does not require any external dependencies or packages. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed for this project.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

# Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculator

This software module provides a function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers without leaving a remainder.

## Main Function

The primary function provided by this module is:

- `greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int`: This function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their greatest common divisor.

### Example Usage

```python
>>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
1
>>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
5
```

## Installation

To use this software, you need to have Python installed on your system. The module does not have any external dependencies, so no additional packages are required.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the repository**: If the code is hosted in a version control system, clone the repository to your local machine.

3. **Navigate to the project directory**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.

## How to Use

1. **Open a Python environment**: You can use a Python interpreter, a Jupyter notebook, or any Python IDE of your choice.

2. **Import the function**: In your Python environment, import the `greatest_common_divisor` function from the `main.py` file.

   ```python
   from main import greatest_common_divisor
   ```

3. **Call the function**: Use the function by passing two integers as arguments to calculate their GCD.

   ```python
   result = greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
   print(result)  # Output: 5
   ```

## Documentation

This module is straightforward and does not require additional documentation beyond the examples provided. The function implements the Euclidean algorithm, which is efficient and widely used for computing the GCD.

For any further questions or support, please contact the development team.
