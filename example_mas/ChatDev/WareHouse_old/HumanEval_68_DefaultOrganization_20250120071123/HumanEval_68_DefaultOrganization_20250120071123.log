    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To solve the given task, we need to implement the `pluck` function in Python. The function will identify the smallest even value in a list and return it along with its index. If there are no even values or the list is empty, it will return an empty list.

Since the task specifies not to implement a GUI and only to write the necessary code in the `main.py` file, we will focus solely on the logic required for the `pluck` function.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

# Pluck Function

A simple Python utility to identify and return the smallest even value from an array of non-negative integers, along with its index. This function is particularly useful for applications that require quick identification of specific node values in data structures like trees.

## Main Functionality

The primary function provided by this software is `pluck(arr)`, which performs the following tasks:

- **Input**: Accepts an array of non-negative integers.
- **Output**: Returns a list containing the smallest even value and its index from the array. If no even values are present or the array is empty, it returns an empty list.

### Example Usage

1. **Input**: `[4, 2, 3]`
   - **Output**: `[2, 1]`
   - **Explanation**: 2 is the smallest even value and is located at index 1.

2. **Input**: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - **Output**: `[2, 1]`
   - **Explanation**: 2 is the smallest even value and is located at index 1.

3. **Input**: `[]`
   - **Output**: `[]`
   - **Explanation**: The array is empty, so no even values are present.

4. **Input**: `[5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]`
   - **Output**: `[0, 1]`
   - **Explanation**: 0 is the smallest even value, and the first occurrence is at index 1.

## Installation

To use the `pluck` function, ensure you have Python installed on your system. This function does not require any external libraries, so no additional dependencies are necessary.

### Quick Install

1. **Python Installation**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the `pluck` function.

3. **Run the Function**: You can execute the function by running the `main.py` file in a Python environment.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Import the Function**: If you are integrating this function into another project, import it using:

   ```python
   from main import pluck
   ```

2. **Call the Function**: Pass an array of non-negative integers to the `pluck` function.

   ```python
   result = pluck([4, 2, 3])
   print(result)  # Output: [2, 1]
   ```

## Documentation

For further details and examples, refer to the inline documentation within the `main.py` file. This documentation provides comprehensive explanations of the function's behavior and edge cases.

```

This manual provides a clear and concise guide on how to use the `pluck` function, including installation instructions and example usage scenarios.

A simple Python utility to identify and return the smallest even value from an array of non-negative integers, along with its index. This function is particularly useful for applications that require quick identification of specific node values in data structures like trees.

## Main Functionality

The primary function provided by this software is `pluck(arr)`, which performs the following tasks:

- **Input**: Accepts an array of non-negative integers.
- **Output**: Returns a list containing the smallest even value and its index from the array. If no even values are present or the array is empty, it returns an empty list.

### Example Usage

1. **Input**: `[4, 2, 3]`
   - **Output**: `[2, 1]`
   - **Explanation**: 2 is the smallest even value and is located at index 1.

2. **Input**: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - **Output**: `[2, 1]`
   - **Explanation**: 2 is the smallest even value and is located at index 1.

3. **Input**: `[]`
   - **Output**: `[]`
   - **Explanation**: The array is empty, so no even values are present.

4. **Input**: `[5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]`
   - **Output**: `[0, 1]`
   - **Explanation**: 0 is the smallest even value, and the first occurrence is at index 1.
