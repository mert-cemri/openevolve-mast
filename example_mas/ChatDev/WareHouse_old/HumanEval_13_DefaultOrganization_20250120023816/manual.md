# Greatest Common Divisor Calculator

This software module provides a simple function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers without leaving a remainder.

## Main Function

The main function provided by this module is:

- `greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int`: This function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their greatest common divisor. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import greatest_common_divisor

# Example 1
result1 = greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
print(result1)  # Output: 1

# Example 2
result2 = greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
print(result2)  # Output: 5
```

## Installation

This module does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to use. You only need Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Clone or download the repository**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the GCD function.

3. **Run your Python script**: Use the function in your Python script as shown in the example usage.

## How to Use

1. **Import the function**: Import the `greatest_common_divisor` function from the `main.py` file into your Python script.

2. **Call the function**: Pass two integers as arguments to the function to get their GCD.

3. **Output the result**: Use the returned value as needed in your application.

## Documentation

The function is straightforward and does not require additional documentation. The docstring within the function provides examples of its usage.
