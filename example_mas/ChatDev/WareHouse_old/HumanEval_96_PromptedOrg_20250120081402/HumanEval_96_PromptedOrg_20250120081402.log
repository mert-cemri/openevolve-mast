Given the nature of the task, which involves writing a function to solve a programming problem, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application" as it involves implementing a software tool using Python. This aligns with the requirement to write and test code. What are your thoughts on this?

To solve the task, we need to implement the function `count_up_to(n)` which returns a list of prime numbers less than the given non-negative integer `n`. Let's break down the steps needed to implement this function:

1. **Check for Edge Cases**: If `n` is less than 2, return an empty list since there are no prime numbers less than 2.

2. **Prime Number Check**: Implement a helper function to check if a number is prime. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.

3. **Iterate and Collect Primes**: Iterate through numbers from 2 to `n-1`, check if each number is prime, and collect them in a list.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

    def is_prime(num):
        """Check if a number is a prime number."""
        if num < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):

            primes.append(i)

```

This code defines the `count_up_to` function, which uses a helper function `is_prime` to determine if a number is prime. It then iterates through numbers from 2 to `n-1`, checks if they are prime, and collects them in a list, which is returned as the result.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses built-in Python functions and libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that there are no additional packages needed beyond the standard Python library.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Prime Number Finder

This software module provides a simple function to find all prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer `n`. It is designed to be lightweight and does not require any external dependencies.

## Main Functionality

The main function of this software is `count_up_to(n)`, which takes a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list of all prime numbers less than `n`.

### Function Details

- **Function Name:** `count_up_to`
- **Input:** A non-negative integer `n`
- **Output:** A list of prime numbers less than `n`

#### Example Usage

```python
count_up_to(5)    # Returns: [2, 3]
count_up_to(11)   # Returns: [2, 3, 5, 7]
count_up_to(0)    # Returns: []
count_up_to(20)   # Returns: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
count_up_to(1)    # Returns: []
count_up_to(18)   # Returns: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external libraries or dependencies. You only need Python installed on your system to run the function.

### Quick Install

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
