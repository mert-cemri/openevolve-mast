# Flappy Bird Clone

Welcome to the Flappy Bird Clone, a simple yet addictive game where you control a bird trying to fly through a series of pipes without crashing. This game is developed using Python and the Pygame library.

## Main Functions

- **Flap the Bird**: Press the spacebar to make the bird flap its wings and ascend.
- **Avoid the Pipes**: Navigate through randomly generated vertical gaps in the pipes.
- **Score Points**: Earn points for each successful pass through the pipes.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.

## Installation

To run the Flappy Bird Clone, you need to have Python and Pygame installed on your system. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

### Step 1: Install Python

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install Pygame

Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame==2.1.2
```

Alternatively, you can use the `requirements.txt` file to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Play

1. **Launch the Game**: Run the `main.py` file to start the game.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Control the Bird**: Use the spacebar to make the bird flap its wings. The bird will ascend with each flap and descend due to gravity when not flapping.

3. **Navigate Through Pipes**: Avoid hitting the pipes by carefully timing your flaps to pass through the gaps.

4. **Score Points**: Each successful pass through a set of pipes increases your score by one.

5. **Game Over**: The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or the ground. You can restart the game by running the `main.py` file again.

## Additional Information

- **Graphics**: The game features simple graphics with a yellow bird and green pipes against a sky-blue background.
- **Sound**: Currently, the game does not include sound effects, but you can enhance it by adding your own.
- **Customization**: Feel free to modify the code to change the game's difficulty, appearance, or add new features.

Enjoy playing the Flappy Bird Clone and challenge yourself to achieve the highest score possible!
