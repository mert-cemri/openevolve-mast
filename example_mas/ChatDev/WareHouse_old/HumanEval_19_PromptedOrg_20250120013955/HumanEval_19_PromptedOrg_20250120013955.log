Given the task at hand, which involves writing and sorting numbers in a string format, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a software tool that processes input and provides a sorted output, which aligns well with the capabilities of a Python application. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" is indeed the most suitable product modality for this task, as it involves writing a Python script to process and sort the input data. This aligns with our company's expertise in developing software tools. Let's proceed with this modality.

To solve the task, we need to implement the `sort_numbers` function that takes a space-delimited string of numerals (from 'zero' to 'nine') and returns a string with these numbers sorted from smallest to largest. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Mapping Numerals to Integers**: Create a dictionary to map each numeral to its corresponding integer value.
2. **Splitting the Input**: Split the input string into individual numeral words.
3. **Sorting**: Use the mapping to convert these words to integers, sort them, and then convert them back to words.
4. **Joining the Result**: Join the sorted words back into a single space-delimited string.

Now, let's implement this in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python

'''

This module contains a function to sort numerals from 'zero' to 'nine' in ascending order.

def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    """ Input is a space-delimited string of numerals from 'zero' to 'nine'.
    Valid choices are 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight' and 'nine'.
    Return the string with numbers sorted from smallest to largest
    >>> sort_numbers('three one five')
    'one three five'
    """
    # Mapping of numerals to their corresponding integer values
    numeral_to_int = {
        'zero': 0,
        'one': 1,
        'two': 2,
        'three': 3,
        'four': 4,
        'five': 5,
        'six': 6,
        'seven': 7,
        'eight': 8,
        'nine': 9
    }
    
    # Mapping of integers back to their corresponding numeral words
    int_to_numeral = {v: k for k, v in numeral_to_int.items()}
    
    # Split the input string into a list of numeral words
    numeral_list = numbers.split()
    
    # Convert numeral words to integers, sort them, and convert back to numeral words
    sorted_numerals = sorted(numeral_list, key=lambda x: numeral_to_int[x])
    
    # Join the sorted numeral words into a single string
    return ' '.join(sorted_numerals)

```

This implementation should correctly sort the input numerals as specified in the task.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code only uses standard Python libraries and functions. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, indicating that no additional packages need to be installed for the project to run properly.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Sort Numbers User Manual

Welcome to the Sort Numbers application! This software is designed to sort a space-delimited string of numerals from 'zero' to 'nine' in ascending order. This manual provides a comprehensive guide on how to use the software, including its main functions, installation instructions, and usage examples.

## Main Function

The primary function of this software is:

### `sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str`

- **Description**: This function takes a space-delimited string of numerals (from 'zero' to 'nine') and returns a string with the numerals sorted in ascending order.
- **Input**: A string containing numeral words separated by spaces. Valid numeral words are 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', and 'nine'.
- **Output**: A string with the numeral words sorted from smallest to largest.

#### Example
```python
>>> sort_numbers('three one five')
'one three five'
