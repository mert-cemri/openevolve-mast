Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and correcting software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This would allow us to implement the necessary logic in Python to solve the problem as requested by the customer. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree. An "Application" is the most appropriate modality for this task as it involves implementing and testing a specific function in Python. This aligns with the customer's request to write and correct software code.

To solve the task, we need to implement the function `correct_bracketing` in Python. This function will check if every opening bracket ("<") has a corresponding closing bracket (">") in the given string. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Initialize a Counter**: We will use a counter to keep track of the number of unmatched opening brackets ("<").

2. **Iterate Through the String**: For each character in the string:
   - If it's an opening bracket ("<"), increment the counter.
   - If it's a closing bracket (">"), decrement the counter.
   - If the counter becomes negative at any point, it means there's a closing bracket without a matching opening bracket, so we return `False`.

3. **Final Check**: After iterating through the string, if the counter is zero, it means all opening brackets have been matched with closing brackets, so we return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

Now, let's implement this in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains the function correct_bracketing which checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in a string of "<" and ">".

'''

def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """ brackets is a string of "<" and ">".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("<")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("<>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
    False
    """
    counter = 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            counter += 1
        elif char == '>':
            counter -= 1
        if counter < 0:
            return False
    return counter == 0
```

This code defines the `correct_bracketing` function, which correctly checks the balance of brackets in the input string. The function uses a counter to track unmatched opening brackets and ensures that no unmatched closing brackets exist.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required since it only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can create an empty one or simply include a comment indicating that no external packages are needed.

Here's how you can create an empty `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

Or simply leave it empty:

```
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any third-party libraries.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

```

Programmer: For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required since it only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can create an empty one or simply include a comment indicating that no external packages are needed.
Here's how you can create an empty `requirements.txt` file:
```

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
