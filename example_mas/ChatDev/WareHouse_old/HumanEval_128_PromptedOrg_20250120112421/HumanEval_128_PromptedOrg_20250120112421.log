To solve the task, we need to implement the function `prod_signs` in Python. The function should compute the sum of the magnitudes of integers in an array, multiplied by the product of all signs of each number in the array. The sign of each number is represented by 1 (positive), -1 (negative), or 0 (zero). If the array is empty, the function should return `None`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the function needs to do:

1. **Check for an empty array**: If the input array is empty, return `None`.
2. **Calculate the product of signs**: Iterate through the array and calculate the product of the signs of each number. If any number is zero, the product of signs should be zero.
3. **Calculate the sum of magnitudes**: Compute the sum of the absolute values of the numbers in the array.
4. **Return the result**: Multiply the sum of magnitudes by the product of signs and return the result.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

    Example:

    >>> prod_signs([0, 1]) == 0
    >>> prod_signs([]) == None
    """
    if not arr:
        return None
    
    product_of_signs = 1
    sum_of_magnitudes = 0
    
    for num in arr:
        if num > 0:
            sign = 1
        elif num < 0:
            sign = -1
        else:
            sign = 0
        
        product_of_signs *= sign
        sum_of_magnitudes += abs(num)
        
        if product_of_signs == 0:
            return 0
    
    return sum_of_magnitudes * product_of_signs
```

This code implements the `prod_signs` function as described, ensuring it handles all edge cases, including empty arrays and arrays containing zero.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The `prod_signs` function only uses built-in Python functionalities. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for the sake of completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the CEO, I confirm that the Programmer's assessment is correct. The provided code for the `prod_signs` function does not utilize any external libraries or packages beyond Python's standard library. Therefore, there are no dependencies to list in a `requirements.txt` file. However, for the sake of completeness and to adhere to best practices, an empty `requirements.txt` file can be included in the project. It would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This ensures that anyone reviewing the project understands that no additional packages are needed for the code to function as intended. If there are any further questions or tasks, please feel free to reach out.

# prod_signs User Manual

Welcome to the `prod_signs` function user manual. This document will guide you through the installation, usage, and functionality of the `prod_signs` function implemented in Python.

## Overview

The `prod_signs` function is designed to calculate the sum of the magnitudes of integers in an array, multiplied by the product of all signs of each number in the array. The signs are represented by 1 for positive numbers, -1 for negative numbers, and 0 for zero. The function returns `None` for an empty array.

### Main Functionality

- **Calculate Product of Signs**: The function computes the product of the signs of all numbers in the array.
- **Sum of Magnitudes**: It calculates the sum of the absolute values (magnitudes) of the numbers in the array.
- **Return Value**: The function returns the product of the sum of magnitudes and the product of signs. If the array is empty, it returns `None`.

### Example Usage

```python
>>> prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4])
-9

>>> prod_signs([0, 1])
0

>>> prod_signs([])
None
```

## Installation

The `prod_signs` function does not require any external dependencies, making it simple to set up and use. You only need a Python environment to run the function.
