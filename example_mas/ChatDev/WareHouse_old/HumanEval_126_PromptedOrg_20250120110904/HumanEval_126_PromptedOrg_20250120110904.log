.
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To solve the task, we need to implement the `is_sorted` function in Python. The function should check if a list of integers is sorted in ascending order and ensure that no number appears more than twice consecutively. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

1. **Function Name**: `is_sorted`
   - **Purpose**: To determine if a list of integers is sorted in ascending order and does not contain more than one duplicate of the same number consecutively.

2. **Logic**:
   - Iterate through the list and check if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
   - Count consecutive duplicates and ensure no number appears more than twice consecutively.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''
Given a list of numbers, return whether or not they are sorted
in ascending order. If list has more than 1 duplicate of the same
number, return False. Assume no negative numbers and only integers.

Examples
is_sorted([5]) ➞ True

is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5]) ➞ False
is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) ➞ True
is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) ➞ True
is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]) ➞ False
is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]) ➞ True
is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]) ➞ False
'''

def is_sorted(lst):
    if not lst:
        return True
    
    duplicate_count = 1
    
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        if lst[i] < lst[i - 1]:
            return False
        if lst[i] == lst[i - 1]:
            duplicate_count += 1
            if duplicate_count > 2:
                return False
        else:
            duplicate_count = 1
    
    return True
```

This code defines the `is_sorted` function, which checks if the list is sorted in ascending order and ensures that no number appears more than twice consecutively. The function iterates through the list, comparing each element with the previous one to ensure the list is sorted and counting duplicates to ensure the condition on duplicates is met.

This code defines the `is_sorted` function, which checks if the list is sorted in ascending order and ensures that no number appears more than twice consecutively. The function iterates through the list, comparing each element with the previous one to ensure the list is sorted and counting duplicates to ensure the condition on duplicates is met.

The code has a logical error in handling duplicates. The condition `if duplicate_count > 2:` should be `if duplicate_count > 1:` to correctly return `False` when there is more than one duplicate of the same number. Additionally, the initialization of `duplicate_count` should be set to 0 instead of 1 to accurately count duplicates.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    if not lst:
        return True
    duplicate_count = 0
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        if lst[i] < lst[i - 1]:
            return False
        if lst[i] == lst[i - 1]:
            duplicate_count += 1

                return False
        else:
            duplicate_count = 0

Comments on Codes:
"The code has a logical error in handling duplicates. The condition `if duplicate_count > 2:` should be `if duplicate_count > 1:` to correctly return `False` when there is more than one duplicate of the same number. Additionally, the initialization of `duplicate_count` should be set to 0 instead of 1 to accurately count duplicates.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    if not lst:
        return True
    duplicate_count = 0
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        if lst[i] < lst[i - 1]:
            return False
        if lst[i] == lst[i - 1]:
            duplicate_count += 1
            if duplicate_count > 1:
                return False
        else:
            duplicate_count = 0
    return True
```

This should fix the issue and meet the user's requirements."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.

.
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The code correctly implements the logic to check if a list is sorted in ascending order and ensures that no number appears more than once consecutively. However, there is a minor issue with the handling of duplicate counts. The current logic resets the `duplicate_count` only when a non-duplicate is found, which is correct. However, the initialization of `duplicate_count` should be outside the loop to ensure it starts at zero for each new list. Additionally, the check for an empty list at the beginning is redundant since an empty list is inherently sorted. 

Here is the revised code:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    '''
    Given a list of numbers, return whether or not they are sorted
    in ascending order. If list has more than 1 duplicate of the same
    number, return False. Assume no negative numbers and only integers.
    '''
    duplicate_count = 0
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        if lst[i] < lst[i - 1]:
            return False
        if lst[i] == lst[i - 1]:
            duplicate_count += 1
            if duplicate_count > 1:
                return False
        else:
            duplicate_count = 0
    return True
```

This code is now optimized and adheres to the task requirements.

In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

For the given task and code, there are no external dependencies or packages required to run the project. The function `is_sorted` is implemented using basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that there are no additional packages needed for the project.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given task and code, there are no external dependencies or packages required to run the project. The function `is_sorted` is implemented using basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should be empty or not needed.

Therefore, a `requirements.txt` file is not necessary for this project. However, for the sake of completeness and standard practice, an empty `requirements.txt` file can be included to indicate that no additional packages are required. Here is how it should look:

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# is_sorted Function User Manual

## Introduction

The `is_sorted` function is a simple Python utility designed to determine whether a given list of integers is sorted in ascending order. Additionally, it checks for duplicate values and returns `False` if any number appears more than once consecutively. This function is useful for validating sorted data with specific constraints on duplicates.

## Main Functionality

- **is_sorted(lst):** This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value:
  - `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order and no integer appears more than once consecutively.
  - `False` if the list is not sorted or if any integer appears more than once consecutively.

### Examples

- `is_sorted([5])` ➞ `True`
- `is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` ➞ `True`
- `is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5])` ➞ `False`
- `is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4])` ➞ `True`
- `is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4])` ➞ `False`

## Installation

The `is_sorted` function does not require any external dependencies, making it easy to integrate into any Python project. Simply copy the function code into your Python script or module.

## Usage

1. **Copy the Code:**
   - Copy the `is_sorted` function code into your Python file.

2. **Call the Function:**
   - Use the function by passing a list of integers as an argument.
   ```python
   result = is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
   print(result)  # Output: True
   ```

3. **Interpret the Result:**
   - The function returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order with no more than one duplicate of any number.
   - It returns `False` if the list is not sorted or if any number appears more than once consecutively.

## Conclusion

The `is_sorted` function is a straightforward tool for checking the order and duplicate constraints of a list of integers. It is easy to use and integrate into existing Python projects, providing a quick way to validate sorted data with specific rules on duplicates.
