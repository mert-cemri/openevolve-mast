Given the task involves writing and evaluating a piece of software code, it seems most appropriate to consider the "Application" modality. This would allow us to focus on implementing the necessary logic in Python without any additional presentation layers. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree that the "Application" modality is the most suitable choice for this task, as it involves writing and executing Python code to solve the problem. This approach aligns with the requirement to focus solely on the code logic.

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

It iterates through the operators and applies them sequentially to the operands, starting with the first operand. The function raises a `ValueError` if an unsupported operator is encountered.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code only uses basic Python operations and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed for the project to run properly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

# Algebra Expression Evaluator

This software provides a simple utility to evaluate algebraic expressions based on given operators and operands. It is designed to handle basic algebra operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, floor division, and exponentiation.

## Main Functions

The core function of this software is `do_algebra(operator, operand)`, which takes two lists as input:

- `operator`: A list of strings representing basic algebra operations. Supported operations include:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Floor division (`//`)
  - Exponentiation (`**`)

- `operand`: A list of non-negative integers that serve as the operands in the algebraic expression.

The function evaluates the expression formed by these operators and operands and returns the result.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage of the do_algebra function
operator = ['+', '*', '-']
operand = [2, 3, 4, 5]
result = do_algebra(operator, operand)  # Output: 9
```

## Installation

This project does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to set up and use. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

# Algebra Expression Evaluator

This software provides a simple utility to evaluate algebraic expressions based on given operators and operands. It is designed to handle basic algebra operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, floor division, and exponentiation.

## Main Functions

The core function of this software is `do_algebra(operator, operand)`, which takes two lists as input:

- `operator`: A list of strings representing basic algebra operations. Supported operations include:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Floor division (`//`)
  - Exponentiation (`**`)

- `operand`: A list of non-negative integers that serve as the operands in the algebraic expression.

The function evaluates the expression formed by these operators and operands and returns the result.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage of the do_algebra function
operator = ['+', '*', '-']
operand = [2, 3, 4, 5]
result = do_algebra(operator, operand)  # Output: 9
```
