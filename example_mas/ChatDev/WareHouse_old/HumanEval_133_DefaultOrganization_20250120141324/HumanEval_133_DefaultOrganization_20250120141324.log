To complete the task, we need to write a Python function that calculates the sum of the squares of the numbers in a list after rounding each number up to the nearest integer. We do not need to implement a GUI as per the customer's task description. Let's focus on creating a functional Python script.

Here is the plan:

1. **Function Name**: `sum_squares`
   - **Purpose**: To calculate the sum of the squares of numbers in a list after rounding each number up to the nearest integer.

2. **Steps**:
   - Import the `math` module to use the `ceil` function for rounding up.
   - Iterate over the list, round each number up using `math.ceil`, square it, and accumulate the sum.
   - Return the accumulated sum.

Now, let's write the code for the `main.py` file:

main.py

```python
'''
This script contains a function to calculate the sum of squared numbers in a given list,
after rounding each number to the nearest upper integer (ceiling).
'''

import math

def sum_squares(lst):
    """You are given a list of numbers.
    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,
    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14
    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98
    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84
    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29
    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6
    """
    return sum(math.ceil(x) ** 2 for x in lst)
```

This code defines the `sum_squares` function, which rounds each number in the list to the nearest upper integer using `math.ceil`, squares it, and then sums all the squared values. This should meet the customer's requirements as specified.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

# Sum Squares Function

This software provides a simple Python function to calculate the sum of squared numbers in a given list. Each number in the list is first rounded up to the nearest integer (using the ceiling function) before being squared and summed.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `sum_squares(lst)`. This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the squares of these numbers after rounding each number up to the nearest integer.

### Function Definition

```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    """
    You are given a list of numbers.
    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,
    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14
    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98
    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84
    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29
    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6
    """
    return sum(math.ceil(x) ** 2 for x in lst)
```

## Installation

### Environment Setup

This function does not require any external dependencies beyond the standard Python library. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Requirements

There are no additional packages required for this function. The `math` module used in the function is part of the Python Standard Library.

## Usage

To use the `sum_squares` function, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Python Script:**

   Create a new Python file, e.g., `main.py`, and include the function definition provided above.

2. **Call the Function:**

   You can call the `sum_squares` function by passing a list of numbers as an argument. For example:

   ```python
   result = sum_squares([1.4, 4.2, 0])
   print(result)  # Output: 29
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**

   Execute your Python script using a Python interpreter. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing your script, and run:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the `sum_squares` function:

```python
# Example usage of sum_squares function
numbers = [1.4, 4.2, 0]
result = sum_squares(numbers)
print(f"The sum of squares is: {result}")
```

This will output:

```
The sum of squares is: 29
```

## Conclusion
