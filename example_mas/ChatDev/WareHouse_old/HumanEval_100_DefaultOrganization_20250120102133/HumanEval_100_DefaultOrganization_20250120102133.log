To address the customer's task, we need to implement the function `make_a_pile` in Python. The function should generate a list of stone counts for each level of a pile, based on the rules provided. Since the task explicitly states not to implement a GUI and only to write the necessary code, we will focus solely on the function implementation in a single file, `main.py`.

Here's the breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Function `make_a_pile(n)`**: This function will take a positive integer `n` and return a list of integers representing the number of stones in each level of the pile. The first level will have `n` stones, and subsequent levels will have stones according to the rules provided (next odd or even number).

Now, let's implement the function in `main.py`.

MAIN.PY

```python
'''
def make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones.
    The number of stones in the next level is:
        - the next odd number if n is odd.
        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

    Examples:
    >>> make_a_pile(3)
    [3, 5, 7]
    """
'''

def make_a_pile(n):
    stones = [n]
    current_stones = n
    for _ in range(1, n):
        if current_stones % 2 == 0:
            current_stones += 2  # Next even number
        else:
            current_stones += 2  # Next odd number
        stones.append(current_stones)
    return stones

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(make_a_pile(3))  # Output: [3, 5, 7]
```

This code defines the `make_a_pile` function, which constructs a list of stone counts for each level of a pile based on the given rules. The function starts with `n` stones and adds the next odd or even number to each subsequent level, depending on whether the current number of stones is odd or even. The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how the function works.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external libraries or packages used in the `main.py` file. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no dependencies needed for the code to run properly.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
```
This indicates that no additional packages are required for the project. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Make a Pile

A simple Python application to calculate the number of stones in each level of a pile, based on a given positive integer `n`. This application is designed to help users understand how to construct a pile of stones with specific rules for odd and even numbers.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this application is encapsulated in the `make_a_pile` function. Given a positive integer `n`, the function returns a list where each element represents the number of stones in each level of the pile. The rules for constructing the pile are as follows:

- The first level has `n` stones.
- For subsequent levels:
  - If `n` is odd, the next level has the next odd number of stones.
  - If `n` is even, the next level has the next even number of stones.

### Example

For `n = 3`, the output will be `[3, 5, 7]`.

## Installation

To use this application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the `main.py` file to your local machine.

3. **Set Up Environment**: Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.

4. **Install Dependencies**: There are no external dependencies required for this application, so you can skip this step.

## Usage

To use the `make_a_pile` function, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

3. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. The script will execute the `make_a_pile` function with a sample input of `3` and print the output `[3, 5, 7]`.

5. To test with different values of `n`, modify the call to `make_a_pile` in the `main.py` file:

   ```python
   print(make_a_pile(your_value_here))
   ```

Replace `your_value_here` with the desired positive integer.

## Documentation

For further details on how the function works, refer to the docstring provided in the `make_a_pile` function within the `main.py` file. This includes a description of the function, its parameters, and examples of usage.

# Make a Pile

A simple Python application to calculate the number of stones in each level of a pile, based on a given positive integer `n`. This application is designed to help users understand how to construct a pile of stones with specific rules for odd and even numbers.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this application is encapsulated in the `make_a_pile` function. Given a positive integer `n`, the function returns a list where each element represents the number of stones in each level of the pile. The rules for constructing the pile are as follows:

- The first level has `n` stones.
- For subsequent levels:
  - If `n` is odd, the next level has the next odd number of stones.
  - If `n` is even, the next level has the next even number of stones.

### Example

For `n = 3`, the output will be `[3, 5, 7]`.

## Installation

To use this application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the `main.py` file to your local machine.

3. **Set Up Environment**: Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.

4. **Install Dependencies**: There are no external dependencies required for this application, so you can skip this step.

## Usage

To use the `make_a_pile` function, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

3. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. The script will execute the `make_a_pile` function with a sample input of `3` and print the output `[3, 5, 7]`.

5. To test with different values of `n`, modify the call to `make_a_pile` in the `main.py` file:

   ```python
   print(make_a_pile(your_value_here))
   ```

Replace `your_value_here` with the desired positive integer.

## Documentation

For further details on how the function works, refer to the docstring provided in the `make_a_pile` function within the `main.py` file. This includes a description of the function, its parameters, and examples of usage.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to better understand how the pile of stones is constructed based on the given rules.
