Given the task at hand, which involves writing a piece of software code to remove duplicates from a list, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a software tool using Python, which aligns with the capabilities of an Application modality. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, we need to focus on the core functionality of the `remove_duplicates` function. The task explicitly states not to implement a GUI interface, so we will disregard the GUI-related instructions and focus solely on the function implementation in Python.

### Core Function

- **Function: `remove_duplicates`**
  - **Purpose**: To remove all elements from a list of integers that occur more than once, while maintaining the order of the remaining elements.

Now, let's write the necessary code for the `remove_duplicates` function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to remove duplicate integers from a list, keeping only unique elements and preserving their order.

'''

from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.
    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    [1, 3, 4]
    """
    # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each number
    count = {}
    for number in numbers:
        if number in count:
            count[number] += 1
        else:
            count[number] = 1
    
    # Create a list to store numbers that occur only once
    result = [number for number in numbers if count[number] == 1]
    
    return result
```

This code implements the `remove_duplicates` function as described. It uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in the list and then constructs a new list containing only those numbers that appear exactly once, preserving their original order.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required beyond the standard Python library. The function `remove_duplicates` only uses basic Python data structures and the `typing` module, which is part of the standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, indicating that no additional packages need to be installed for this project.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

# Remove Duplicates Software

This software provides a simple utility function to remove duplicate integers from a list, keeping only unique elements and preserving their order. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, with no external dependencies required.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `remove_duplicates`, which takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with all elements that occur more than once removed. The order of the remaining elements is preserved as in the input list.

### Function Signature

```python
def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
```

### Example Usage

```python
>>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
[1, 3, 4]
```

In this example, the function removes the duplicate occurrence of the number `2` and returns a list with the unique elements `[1, 3, 4]`.

## Installation

Since this software does not require any external dependencies, you can directly use the provided `main.py` file in your Python environment. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Steps to Install and Use

1. **Download the Software:**
   - Clone or download the repository containing the `main.py` file.

2. **Set Up Your Environment:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Run the Software:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.
   - Run the Python script using the command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

4. **Use the Function:**
   - You can import the `remove_duplicates` function into your own Python scripts or interactive sessions to use it as needed.

## Documentation

This software is straightforward and does not require extensive documentation. The function is self-explanatory and can be easily integrated into larger projects where duplicate removal is necessary.

For any further assistance or questions, please contact our support team.
