# Largest Divisor Finder

This software provides a simple function to find the largest divisor of a given integer `n` that is smaller than `n` itself. This can be useful in various mathematical computations and applications where divisors are needed.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `largest_divisor(n: int) -> int`. It takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest integer that divides `n` evenly and is smaller than `n`.

### Example

```python
>>> largest_divisor(15)
5
```

In this example, the largest divisor of 15 that is smaller than 15 is 5.
