Given the nature of the task, which involves writing a function to solve a specific coding problem, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This would allow us to implement the function in Python, which is the language specified in the task. The focus is on delivering a functional piece of code rather than a visual or document-based product. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. Since the task requires writing a specific function in Python, the "Application" modality is the most appropriate choice. It allows us to focus on implementing the code effectively. Let's proceed with this modality.

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `count_up_to(n)` that returns an array of prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer `n`. The function should correctly identify prime numbers and return them in a list.

### Core Function:
- **`count_up_to(n)`**: This function will take a non-negative integer `n` and return a list of prime numbers less than `n`.

### Helper Function:
- **`is_prime(num)`**: This helper function will determine if a given number `num` is a prime number.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to find all prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer.

'''

def is_prime(num):
    """
    Determine if a number is prime.
    
    :param num: Integer to check for primality.
    :return: True if num is prime, False otherwise.
    """
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def count_up_to(n):
    """
    Implement a function that takes a non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n.
    
    :param n: Non-negative integer.

    """
    primes = []
    for num in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(num):
            primes.append(num)
    return primes
```

This code defines the `count_up_to` function, which uses the `is_prime` helper function to check each number less than `n` for primality and collects the prime numbers in a list. The `is_prime` function efficiently checks for primality by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The Programmer is correct in their assessment. The provided code for the `count_up_to` function and its helper function `is_prime` does not utilize any external libraries or packages. It relies solely on Python's built-in capabilities to determine prime numbers. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would indeed be empty, as there are no additional dependencies required.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

# Prime Number Finder

This software module provides a function to find all prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer. It is designed to be simple and efficient, with no external dependencies required.

## Main Functions

### `count_up_to(n)`

- **Description**: This function takes a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list of all prime numbers less than `n`.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `n` (int): A non-negative integer.
- **Returns**: 
  - A list of integers that are prime numbers less than `n`.

### `is_prime(num)`

- **Description**: This helper function determines if a given number is prime.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `num` (int): The integer to check for primality.
- **Returns**: 
  - `True` if `num` is a prime number, `False` otherwise.

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it easy to set up and use. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   - Download or clone the repository containing the `main.py` file to your local machine.

2. **Run the Code**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing `main.py`.
   - Run the Python script using the command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
   - You can also import the `count_up_to` function into your own Python scripts to use it directly.

3. **Example Usage**:
   - To find all prime numbers less than 10, you can use the function as follows:
     ```python
     from main import count_up_to
     
     primes = count_up_to(10)
     print(primes)  # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7]
     ```

## Notes

- The function `count_up_to` is designed to handle non-negative integers. Ensure that the input is a non-negative integer to avoid unexpected behavior.
- The algorithm used for checking primality is efficient for small to moderately large numbers. For very large numbers, consider using more advanced algorithms or libraries specialized in number theory.
