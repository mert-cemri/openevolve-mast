Given the task is to write a piece of software code to calculate the area of a triangle, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to focus on implementing the required functionality in Python without any additional presentation or visualization elements. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree. An "Application" is the most appropriate product modality for this task as it allows us to focus solely on the code implementation required to calculate the area of a triangle. Let's proceed with this modality.

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

.
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To complete the task, we need to implement the function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle given the length of a side (base) and the height. The formula for the area of a triangle is:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

We will implement this function in a single Python file named `main.py`.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to calculate the area of a triangle given the base and height.

'''

def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Given length of a side (base) and height, return area for a triangle.
    
    Parameters:
    a (float): The length of the base of the triangle.
    h (float): The height of the triangle.

    Returns:
    float: The area of the triangle.

    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

This code defines the `triangle_area` function, which takes two parameters: `a` (the base of the triangle) and `h` (the height of the triangle). It calculates the area using the formula for the area of a triangle and returns the result. The function is also documented with a docstring that includes a usage example.
