# Exchange Function

The Exchange Function is a Python-based utility that determines if it's possible to exchange elements between two lists to make the first list contain only even numbers.

## Main Functionality

The primary function of this software is:

- **exchange(lst1, lst2):** This function takes two lists of numbers as input and checks if elements can be exchanged between them to make all elements in the first list (`lst1`) even. It returns "YES" if such an exchange is possible, otherwise it returns "NO".

### Example Usage

- `exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])` returns "YES"
- `exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4])` returns "NO"

## Installation

This project does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to set up and use. You only need Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the repository:** If the code is hosted in a repository, clone it using:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

4. **Run the script:** You can directly run the `main.py` file to test the function.
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Open the `main.py` file:** This file contains the `exchange` function.

2. **Modify the input lists:** You can change the input lists `lst1` and `lst2` in the function call to test different scenarios.

3. **Run the script:** Execute the script to see the result of the exchange function.
