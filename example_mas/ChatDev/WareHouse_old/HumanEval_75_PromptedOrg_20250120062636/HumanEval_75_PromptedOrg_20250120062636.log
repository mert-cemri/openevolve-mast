To solve the task, we need to implement a function `is_multiply_prime(a)` that checks if a given number `a` is the product of exactly three prime numbers. Since `a` is less than 100, we can use a list of prime numbers less than 100 to check the condition.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the implementation:

1. **Identify Prime Numbers**: First, we need a list of all prime numbers less than 100.
2. **Check Multiplication**: For each combination of three prime numbers, check if their product equals `a`.
3. **Return Result**: If any combination matches, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to determine if a given number is the product of exactly three prime numbers.

'''

def is_multiply_prime(a):
    """Check if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers and return True if it is, False otherwise."""
    # List of prime numbers less than 100
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
    
    # Check all combinations of three primes
    for i in range(len(primes)):
        for j in range(i, len(primes)):
            for k in range(j, len(primes)):
                if primes[i] * primes[j] * primes[k] == a:
                    return True
    return False
```

This code defines the function `is_multiply_prime(a)` which checks if the number `a` is the product of exactly three prime numbers. It iterates over all possible combinations of three prime numbers and checks if their product equals `a`. If a valid combination is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a conversation between two roles: Programmer: ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages.

"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The function `is_multiply_prime` only utilizes basic Python functionality and does not require any additional dependencies. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that there are no additional packages needed for the project to run. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

The programmer's assessment is correct. The provided code in `main.py` does not utilize any external libraries or packages, as it only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, there are no additional dependencies required for the project to run. 

If you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would simply indicate that there are no external dependencies required. Here is what the `requirements.txt` file would look like:

# is_multiply_prime

This software module provides a function to determine if a given number is the product of exactly three prime numbers. It is designed to work with numbers less than 100.

## Main Functionality

The main function in this module is `is_multiply_prime(a)`, which checks if the input number `a` is the multiplication of three prime numbers. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Example

```python
is_multiply_prime(30)  # Returns: True, because 30 = 2 * 3 * 5
is_multiply_prime(28)  # Returns: False, because 28 is not the product of three primes

 ```markdown
# is_multiply_prime

This software module provides a function to determine if a given number is the product of exactly three prime numbers. It is designed to work with numbers less than 100.

## Main Functionality

The main function in this module is `is_multiply_prime(a)`, which checks if the input number `a` is the multiplication of three prime numbers. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Example

```python
is_multiply_prime(30)  # Returns: True, because 30 = 2 * 3 * 5
is_multiply_prime(28)  # Returns: False, because 28 is not the product of three primes
```
