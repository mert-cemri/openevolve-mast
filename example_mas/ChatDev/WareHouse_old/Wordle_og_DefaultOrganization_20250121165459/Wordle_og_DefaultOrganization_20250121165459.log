Given the requirements of the task, the product needs to be a playable game from the Linux Terminal without a dedicated UX or GUI platform. This suggests that the product should be implemented in a way that allows for text-based interaction and logic processing. Considering the modalities we have, an "Application" implemented via Python seems to be the most suitable choice, as it can handle the logic of the game and provide the necessary terminal-based interaction. What are your thoughts?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" implemented via Python is indeed the most suitable choice for this task. It allows us to create a text-based game that can be played directly from the Linux Terminal, meeting the customer's requirements.

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Design a standard wordle game by providing a daily 5-letter English language word. The game should allow a player to take 6 turns to guess the word. Correct guess for each letter is colored by green (correct letter in correct position), grey for invalid letter, or yellow for correct letter in wrong position.

If the player guesses the word within the allowed number of attempts, they win. If not, the solution is revealed.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To implement the Wordle game as specified, we will create a Python application that runs in the Linux Terminal. Since the requirement is to avoid a graphical user interface and instead use terminal output, we will not use any GUI frameworks. Instead, we will focus on creating a text-based interface using standard input and output.

Here is the plan for the core classes and functions:

1. **WordleGame**: This class will manage the game logic, including selecting the daily word, processing guesses, and determining the outcome of each guess.
   - `__init__(self)`: Initializes the game with a daily word and sets up the game state.
   - `get_daily_word(self)`: Retrieves the daily word (for simplicity, we'll hardcode a word list and select one randomly).
   - `process_guess(self, guess)`: Compares the player's guess to the daily word and returns feedback on each letter.
   - `play(self)`: Manages the game loop, allowing the player to make guesses and providing feedback.

2. **main()**: The entry point of the application, which creates an instance of `WordleGame` and starts the game.

Now, let's implement the code.

**main.py**

```python
'''

This module contains the main entry point for the Wordle game. It initializes the game and starts the game loop.

'''

import random

class WordleGame:
    def __init__(self):
        self.daily_word = self.get_daily_word()
        self.max_attempts = 6
        self.attempts = 0

    def get_daily_word(self):
        # For simplicity, we use a fixed list of words
        word_list = ['apple', 'grape', 'peach', 'berry', 'melon']
        return random.choice(word_list)

    def process_guess(self, guess):
        feedback = ['grey'] * 5
        word_letters = list(self.daily_word)
        
        # First pass: check for correct letters in correct positions
        for i in range(5):
            if guess[i] == self.daily_word[i]:
                feedback[i] = 'green'
                word_letters[i] = None  # Mark this letter as used

        # Second pass: check for correct letters in wrong positions
        for i in range(5):
            if feedback[i] == 'grey' and guess[i] in word_letters:
                feedback[i] = 'yellow'
                word_letters[word_letters.index(guess[i])] = None  # Mark this letter as used

        return feedback

    def play(self):
        print("Welcome to Wordle!")
        print("Guess the 5-letter word. You have 6 attempts.")

        while self.attempts < self.max_attempts:
            guess = input(f"Attempt {self.attempts + 1}: ").strip().lower()
            if len(guess) != 5:
                print("Please enter a 5-letter word.")
                continue

            self.attempts += 1
            feedback = self.process_guess(guess)
            print("Feedback:", feedback)

            if guess == self.daily_word:
                print("Congratulations! You've guessed the word!")
                return

        print(f"Sorry, you've used all attempts. The word was: {self.daily_word}")

def main():
    game = WordleGame()
    game.play()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code provides a simple text-based Wordle game that can be played in the Linux Terminal. The player has six attempts to guess a randomly selected 5-letter word, with feedback provided after each guess. The feedback indicates whether each letter is correct and in the correct position (green), correct but in the wrong position (yellow), or not in the word at all (grey).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a standard wordle game by providing a daily 5-letter English language word. The game should allow a player to take 6 turns to guess the word. Correct guess for each letter is colored by green (correct letter in correct position), grey for invalid letter, or yellow for correct letter in wrong position. It should be playable from Linux Terminal, and does not require me to access a dedicated UX or GUI platform, i.e. print the results on terminal at each stage and let me play it there by entering inputs. If the player guesses the word within the allowed number of attempts, they win. If not, the solution is revealed..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To satisfy the user's demand and ensure the software is robust and well-documented, I will make sure the code follows the specified markdown code block format and address any potential issues. Here's the revised code:

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a standard wordle game by providing a daily 5-letter English language word. The game should allow a player to take 6 turns to guess the word. Correct guess for each letter is colored by green (correct letter in correct position), grey for invalid letter, or yellow for correct letter in wrong position. It should be playable from Linux Terminal, and does not require me to access a dedicated UX or GUI platform, i.e. print the results on terminal at each stage and let me play it there by entering inputs. If the player guesses the word within the allowed number of attempts, they win. If not, the solution is revealed..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a standard wordle game by providing a daily 5-letter English language word. The game should allow a player to take 6 turns to guess the word. Correct guess for each letter is colored by green (correct letter in correct position), grey for invalid letter, or yellow for correct letter in wrong position. It should be playable from Linux Terminal, and does not require me to access a dedicated UX or GUI platform, i.e. print the results on terminal at each stage and let me play it there by entering inputs. If the player guesses the word within the allowed number of attempts, they win. If not, the solution is revealed..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a standard wordle game by providing a daily 5-letter English language word. The game should allow a player to take 6 turns to guess the word. Correct guess for each letter is colored by green (correct letter in correct position), grey for invalid letter, or yellow for correct letter in wrong position. It should be playable from Linux Terminal, and does not require me to access a dedicated UX or GUI platform, i.e. print the results on terminal at each stage and let me play it there by entering inputs. If the player guesses the word within the allowed number of attempts, they win. If not, the solution is revealed..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code for the Wordle game, it appears that the project does not use any external Python libraries or packages. The code relies solely on Python's standard library, which means there are no additional dependencies required for this project. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

If you plan to extend the project in the future and include additional libraries, you can update the `requirements.txt` file accordingly.

 <INFO> Based on the provided code for the Wordle game, it appears that the project does not use any external Python libraries or packages. The code relies solely on Python's standard library, which means there are no additional dependencies required for this project. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

If you plan to extend the project in the future and include additional libraries, you can update the `requirements.txt` file accordingly.
