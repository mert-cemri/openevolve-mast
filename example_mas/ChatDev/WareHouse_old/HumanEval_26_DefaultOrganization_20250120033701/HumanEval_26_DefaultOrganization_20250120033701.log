To complete the task as per the customer's requirements, we need to implement the function `remove_duplicates` in Python. The task specifically asks for a solution without a GUI, so we will focus on implementing the function correctly in a single Python file. 

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Purpose**: The `remove_duplicates` function will take a list of integers and return a new list with all elements that occur more than once removed, while maintaining the order of the remaining elements.

2. **Implementation Details**: 
   - We will iterate through the list and count the occurrences of each element.
   - We will then create a new list containing only those elements that appear exactly once.

3. **Code Implementation**: We will write the necessary code in a single file named `main.py`.

Let's proceed with the implementation:

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to remove duplicates from a list of integers,
keeping only elements that appear exactly once and maintaining their order.

'''

from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.
    
    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    [1, 3, 4]
    """
    # Count occurrences of each number
    count = {}
    for number in numbers:
        if number in count:
            count[number] += 1
        else:
            count[number] = 1
    
    # Collect numbers that occur exactly once
    result = [number for number in numbers if count[number] == 1]
    
    return result
```

This code defines the `remove_duplicates` function, which processes the input list to remove any integers that appear more than once, while preserving the order of the remaining integers. The function uses a dictionary to count occurrences and a list comprehension to filter the results.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required beyond the standard Python library. The function `remove_duplicates` only uses basic Python data structures and the `typing` module, which is included in the standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required

This indicates that there are no additional packages needed for the project to run.

"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required beyond the standard Python library. The function `remove_duplicates` only uses basic Python data structures and the `typing` module, which is included in the standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that there are no additional packages needed for the project to run. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Remove Duplicates Software

This software provides a simple utility function to remove duplicate integers from a list, retaining only those elements that appear exactly once and preserving their original order.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this software is encapsulated in the `remove_duplicates` function. This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only those integers that appear exactly once in the input list, maintaining their original order.

### Function Signature

```python
def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
```

### Example Usage

```python
>>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
[1, 3, 4]
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. To use the software, ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Clone or download the repository**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the `remove_duplicates` function.

3. **Run the script**: You can execute the script using Python to test the function.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare your environment**: Make sure Python is installed and accessible from your command line or terminal.

2. **Run the function**: You can test the function by running the `main.py` script in a Python environment.

   Example command to run the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Integrate into your project**: You can copy the `remove_duplicates` function into your own Python project to utilize its functionality.

## Documentation
