# Generate Integers

A simple Python application to generate even integers between two given positive integers, inclusive, in ascending order.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this application is encapsulated in the `generate_integers` function. This function takes two positive integers as input and returns a list of even integers between them, sorted in ascending order. The function is designed to handle cases where the first integer is greater than the second by automatically determining the correct range.

### Function Signature

```python
def generate_integers(a, b):
    """
    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a
    and b, in ascending order.
    """
```

### Example Usage

- `generate_integers(2, 8)` returns `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
- `generate_integers(8, 2)` returns `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
- `generate_integers(10, 14)` returns `[]`
