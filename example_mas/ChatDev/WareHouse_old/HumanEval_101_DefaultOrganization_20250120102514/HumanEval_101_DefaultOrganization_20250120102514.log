Given the task at hand, which involves writing a function to split a string into words, the most appropriate product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task involves implementing a piece of software code, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task as specified, we need to focus on implementing the function `words_string` in Python to split a string of words separated by commas or spaces into an array of words. The task explicitly states not to implement a GUI interface, so we will focus solely on the function implementation in a single file, `main.py`.

Here is the plan:

1. **Function Name**: `words_string`
   - **Purpose**: To split a given string into words based on spaces and commas and return a list of words.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module provides a function to split a string of words separated by commas or spaces into a list of words.

'''

def words_string(s):
    """
    Splits a string into words separated by commas or spaces and returns a list of words.

    Args:
    s (str): A string of words separated by commas or spaces.

    Returns:
    list: A list of words.

    Examples:
    >>> words_string("Hi, my name is John")
    ['Hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John']
    >>> words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six")
    ['One', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six']
    """
    # Replace commas with spaces and split the string by spaces
    return s.replace(',', ' ').split()

```

This code will correctly split the input string into words, handling both spaces and commas as delimiters. The function `words_string` replaces commas with spaces and then splits the string by spaces, effectively separating the words into a list.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given task and code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `words_string` uses only built-in Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

# Words String Splitter

This software provides a simple function to split a string of words separated by commas or spaces into a list of words. It is designed to be straightforward and efficient, making it easy to integrate into larger projects or use as a standalone utility.

## Main Functionality

The primary function of this software is `words_string(s)`, which takes a single string input and returns a list of words. The function handles strings where words are separated by either commas or spaces, ensuring that the output is a clean list of words without any punctuation.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import words_string

# Example 1
result1 = words_string("Hi, my name is John")
print(result1)  # Output: ['Hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John']

# Example 2
result2 = words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six")
print(result2)  # Output: ['One', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six']
```

## Installation

### Environment Setup

To use this software, you need to have Python installed on your system. The function itself does not require any additional dependencies, making it lightweight and easy to use.

1. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change into the directory where the repository is cloned:
   ```bash
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

### Running the Code

Once you have set up your environment, you can run the code directly using Python.

```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Use

1. **Import the Function**: Import the `words_string` function from the `main.py` file into your Python script or interactive shell.

2. **Call the Function**: Pass a string of words separated by commas or spaces to the function and receive a list of words as the output.

3. **Integrate into Projects**: You can integrate this function into larger projects where text processing is required.

## Documentation

For more detailed documentation and examples, please refer to the source code comments in `main.py`. The function is well-documented with examples to help you understand its usage quickly.

## Support

For any issues or questions, please contact our support team or open an issue in the repository. We are committed to providing assistance and improving the software based on user feedback.
