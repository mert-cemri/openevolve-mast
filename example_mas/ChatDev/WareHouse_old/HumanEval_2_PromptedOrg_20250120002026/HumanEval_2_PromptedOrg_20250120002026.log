Given the task at hand, which involves writing a simple function to return the decimal part of a floating-point number, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task involves implementing a piece of software code, which aligns with the capabilities of an Application. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, we need to implement the function `truncate_number` in Python. This function should take a positive floating-point number as input and return the decimal part of the number. The task is straightforward and does not require multiple files or classes. We will implement this function in a single file named `main.py`.

Here's the plan:

1. **Function Name**: `truncate_number`
   - **Purpose**: To extract and return the decimal part of a given positive floating-point number.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to truncate a floating-point number and return its decimal part.

'''

def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    an integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)
    0.5
    """
    integer_part = int(number)
    decimal_part = number - integer_part
    return decimal_part
```

This code defines the `truncate_number` function, which calculates the decimal part by subtracting the integer part from the original number. The function is designed to work with positive floating-point numbers, as specified in the task description.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

# Truncate Number

This software module provides a simple function to truncate a floating-point number and return its decimal part. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, with no external dependencies required.

## Quick Install

No installation of external dependencies is required for this module. It is implemented purely in Python and can be used directly.

## 🤔 What is this?

The `truncate_number` function is a utility that takes a positive floating-point number as input and returns the decimal part of that number. This can be useful in various applications where you need to separate the integer and decimal parts of a number.

### Main Function

- **truncate_number(number: float) -> float**: This function takes a positive floating-point number and returns the decimal part of the number. For example, given the input `3.5`, it will return `0.5`.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the `truncate_number` function.

2. **Import the Function**: In your Python script, import the `truncate_number` function from the `main.py` file.

   ```python
   from main import truncate_number
   ```

3. **Use the Function**: Call the `truncate_number` function with a positive floating-point number as an argument.

   ```python
   result = truncate_number(3.5)
   print(result)  # Output: 0.5
   ```

## Example

Here is a simple example of how to use the `truncate_number` function:

```python
# Import the function
from main import truncate_number

# Example usage
number = 7.89
decimal_part = truncate_number(number)
print(f"The decimal part of {number} is {decimal_part}")
```

This will output:

```
The decimal part of 7.89 is 0.89
```

## Documentation

The function is straightforward and does not require additional documentation. The code is self-explanatory, and the function is designed to be used in any Python environment without additional setup.

Feel free to integrate this function into your projects where you need to handle floating-point numbers and extract their decimal parts.
