To solve the task of making an array palindromic with the minimum number of changes, we need to implement the function `smallest_change` in Python. The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus solely on the logic to determine the minimum number of changes needed.

### Core Function

- **Function Name**: `smallest_change`
  - **Purpose**: To calculate the minimum number of changes required to make an array palindromic.
  - **Parameters**: A list of integers `arr`.
  - **Returns**: An integer representing the minimum number of changes.

### Implementation

The function will iterate over the array from both ends towards the center, comparing elements. If the elements at the mirrored positions are not equal, a change is needed. The total number of such changes will be the result.

Let's implement this in the `main.py` file.

#### main.py

    For example:
    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0

    changes = 0
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if arr[i] != arr[n - i - 1]:
            changes += 1
    return changes

# Example usage:
# print(smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]))  # Output: 4
# print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]))  # Output: 1
# print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]))  # Output: 0
```

This code defines the `smallest_change` function, which calculates the minimum number of changes needed to make an array palindromic by comparing elements from both ends of the array towards the center. The function counts the number of mismatches and returns this count as the result.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `smallest_change` operates solely on basic Python data structures and does not utilize any libraries or modules that need to be installed separately. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project

The primary function of this software is `smallest_change(arr)`, which takes an array of integers as input and returns the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.

### Function Signature

```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic.
    """
```

### Example Usage

```python
# Example 1
print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6]))  # Output: 4

# Example 2
print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]))  # Output: 1

# Example 3
print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]))  # Output: 0
```
