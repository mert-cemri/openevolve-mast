# Smallest Change Software

This software provides a simple utility to determine the minimum number of changes required to make an array palindromic. A palindromic array is one that reads the same forwards and backwards.

## Main Functionality

The primary function of this software is `smallest_change(arr)`, which takes an array of integers as input and returns the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.

### Function Signature

```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic.
    """
```

### Example Usage

```python
# Example 1
print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6]))  # Output: 4

# Example 2
print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]))  # Output: 1

# Example 3
print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]))  # Output: 0
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to use. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Step-by-step Installation Guide

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Obtain the source code by cloning the repository or downloading it as a ZIP file.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the source code is located.

python main.py
```

## How to Use

1. **Open the `main.py` File**: You can edit the `main.py` file to include your own test cases or use the provided examples.

2. **Modify the Array**: Change the input array in the `smallest_change` function call to test different scenarios.

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to see the output, which will indicate the minimum number of changes required.
