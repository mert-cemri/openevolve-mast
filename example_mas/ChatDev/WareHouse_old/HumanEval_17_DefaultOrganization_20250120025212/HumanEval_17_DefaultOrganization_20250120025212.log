Given the task at hand, which involves writing and testing a piece of software code, the most suitable product modality would likely be an "Application". This allows us to focus on the code implementation and testing without the need for additional presentation or visualization formats. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, we need to implement the `parse_music` function in Python. The task does not require a GUI, despite the initial suggestion, so we will focus on implementing the function as specified. The function will parse a string of musical notes and return a list of integers representing the duration of each note in beats.

Here's the breakdown of the function:

- **Function Name**: `parse_music`
- **Purpose**: To parse a string of musical notes and return a list of integers representing the duration of each note in beats.
- **Input**: A string containing musical notes in a special ASCII format.
- **Output**: A list of integers where each integer represents the number of beats a note lasts.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

```

This code defines the `parse_music` function, which takes a string of musical notes and returns a list of integers representing the duration of each note in beats. The function uses a dictionary to map note symbols to their respective beats and processes the input string accordingly.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required beyond the standard Python library. The code only uses the `typing` module, which is part of the Python standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can create an empty one as follows:

```
# requirements.txt

# No external dependencies required for this project.
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any third-party packages.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required beyond the standard Python library. The code only uses the `typing` module, which is part of the Python standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can create an empty one as follows:
```
# requirements.txt
# No external dependencies required for this project.
```
This indicates that the project does not rely on any third-party packages. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I agree with the Programmer's assessment. The provided code in `main.py` does not require any external dependencies beyond the standard Python library. The `typing` module used in the code is part of the standard library, so there are no additional packages to list in a `requirements.txt` file. However, for completeness and to adhere to best practices, we can create an empty `requirements.txt` file to indicate that no external dependencies are needed. Here is how it would look:

```
# requirements.txt
# No external dependencies required for this project.
```

This file serves as a placeholder and communicates to anyone reviewing the project that no additional packages are necessary for the code to function correctly.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)
