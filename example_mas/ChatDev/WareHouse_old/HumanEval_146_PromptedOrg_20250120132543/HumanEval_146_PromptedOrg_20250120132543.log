To solve the task, we need to implement the `specialFilter` function in Python. This function will take an array of numbers as input and return the count of numbers that are greater than 10 and have both their first and last digits as odd numbers.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Filter Criteria**:
   - The number must be greater than 10.
   - Both the first and last digits of the number must be odd.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - Convert the number to a string to easily access the first and last digits.
   - Check if both digits are odd.
   - Count how many numbers in the list satisfy these conditions.

Now, let's write the code for the `specialFilter` function in a single file named `main.py`.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains the implementation of the specialFilter function, which filters numbers based on specific criteria.

def specialFilter(nums):
    """Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns 
    the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both 
    first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
    For example:
    specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]) => 1 
    specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]) => 2
    """
    def is_odd_digit(digit):
        return digit in {'1', '3', '5', '7', '9'}

    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            num_str = str(num)
            if is_odd_digit(num_str[0]) and is_odd_digit(num_str[-1]):
                count += 1
    return count
```

This code defines the `specialFilter` function, which iterates over the list of numbers, checks the conditions, and counts how many numbers meet the criteria. The helper function `is_odd_digit` checks if a given digit is odd.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

.
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The code has a logical issue: it does not correctly handle negative numbers. When converting a negative number to a string, the first character will be a negative sign ('-'), which is not an odd digit. This will cause the function to incorrectly exclude negative numbers that meet the criteria. To fix this, you should take the absolute value of the number before converting it to a string to check the digits.

Here's the revised code:

```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    """Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns 
    the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both 
    first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
    For example:
    specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]) => 1 
    specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]) => 2
    """
    def is_odd_digit(digit):
        return digit in {'1', '3', '5', '7', '9'}
    
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            num_str = str(abs(num))  # Use absolute value to handle negative numbers
            if is_odd_digit(num_str[0]) and is_odd_digit(num_str[-1]):
                count += 1
    return count
```

This change ensures that the function correctly evaluates the first and last digits of negative numbers.

Comments on Codes:
"The code has a logical issue: it does not correctly handle negative numbers. When converting a negative number to a string, the first character will be a negative sign ('-'), which is not an odd digit. This will cause the function to incorrectly exclude negative numbers that meet the criteria. To fix this, you should take the absolute value of the number before converting it to a string to check the digits.

Here's the revised code:

```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    """Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns 
    the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both 
    first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
    For example:
    specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]) => 1 
    specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]) => 2
    """
    def is_odd_digit(digit):
        return digit in {'1', '3', '5', '7', '9'}
    
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            num_str = str(abs(num))  # Use absolute value to handle negative numbers
            if is_odd_digit(num_str[0]) and is_odd_digit(num_str[-1]):
                count += 1
    return count
```

This change ensures that the function correctly evaluates the first and last digits of negative numbers."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `specialFilter` only uses built-in Python functions and data types. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for the sake of completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

This indicates that the project does not require any additional Python packages beyond the standard library.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `specialFilter` only uses built-in Python functions and data types. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for the sake of completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```
This indicates that the project does not require any additional Python packages beyond the standard library. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

The Programmer is correct in their assessment. The `specialFilter` function in the `main.py` file does not rely on any external libraries or packages; it only uses Python's built-in functions and data types. Therefore, there are no additional dependencies required for this project. 

For the sake of completeness and to adhere to standard practices, you can create an empty `requirements.txt` file or include a comment indicating that no external dependencies are needed. Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

```
