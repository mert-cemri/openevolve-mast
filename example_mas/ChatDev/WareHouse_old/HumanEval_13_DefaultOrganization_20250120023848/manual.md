# Greatest Common Divisor Calculator

This software provides a simple function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using Python. The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers without leaving a remainder.

## Main Function

The main function provided by this software is `greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int`. This function takes two integer inputs and returns their greatest common divisor.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import greatest_common_divisor

# Example 1
result1 = greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
print(result1)  # Output: 1

# Example 2
result2 = greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
print(result2)  # Output: 5
```
