We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To complete the task, we need to implement the function `get_odd_collatz` in Python, which will generate the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer `n` and return a sorted list of the odd numbers in that sequence. The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus solely on the function implementation.

Here is the plan:

1. **Function: `get_odd_collatz(n)`**
   - **Purpose**: Generate the Collatz sequence for a given integer `n` and return a sorted list of odd numbers in that sequence.
   - **Steps**:
     - Initialize an empty list to store odd numbers.
     - Use a loop to generate the Collatz sequence until `n` becomes 1.
     - In each iteration, check if `n` is odd. If it is, add it to the list.
     - Update `n` according to the Collatz rules:
       - If `n` is even, divide it by 2.
       - If `n` is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
     - Once the loop ends, return the sorted list of odd numbers.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python

'''

Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

Note: 
    1. Collatz(1) is [1].
    2. returned list sorted in increasing order.

For example:
get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.

'''

def get_odd_collatz(n):
    odd_numbers = []
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 != 0:
            odd_numbers.append(n)
        n = 3 * n + 1 if n % 2 != 0 else n // 2
    odd_numbers.append(1)  # Include 1 as it is part of the sequence
    return sorted(odd_numbers)

```

This code defines the `get_odd_collatz` function, which calculates the Collatz sequence for a given integer `n` and returns a sorted list of odd numbers in that sequence. The function handles the sequence generation and filtering of odd numbers efficiently.

as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

Note: 
    1. Collatz(1) is [1].
    2. returned list sorted in increasing order.

For example:
get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.

'''

def get_odd_collatz(n):
    odd_numbers = []
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 != 0:
            odd_numbers.append(n)
        n = 3 * n + 1 if n % 2 != 0 else n // 2
    odd_numbers.append(1)  # Include 1 as it is part of the sequence
    return sorted(odd_numbers)

```

This code defines the `get_odd_collatz` function, which calculates the Collatz sequence for a given integer `n` and returns a sorted list of odd numbers in that sequence. The function handles the sequence generation and filtering of odd numbers efficiently.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".
