# Starts One Ends

A Python function to calculate the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with the digit '1'.

## Overview

The `starts_one_ends` function is designed to solve a specific mathematical problem: given a positive integer `n`, it returns the count of n-digit positive integers that either start with the digit '1' or end with the digit '1'. This function is useful for mathematical computations and problem-solving where such conditions are required.

## Quick Install

There are no external dependencies required for this software. You only need Python installed on your system to run the function.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Running the Function

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**

   You can clone the repository using git or download the ZIP file and extract it.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**

   Change your directory to where the `main.py` file is located.

   ```bash
   cd path/to/directory
   ```

3. **Run the Function**

   You can run the function by executing the `main.py` file in a Python environment. Open a terminal or command prompt and execute:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   You can also directly use the function in a Python script or interactive session:

   ```python
   from main import starts_one_ends

   # Example usage
   n = 3
   result = starts_one_ends(n)
   print(f"The count of {n}-digit numbers starting or ending with 1 is: {result}")
   ```

### Example

For `n = 3`, the function will calculate the count of 3-digit numbers that start or end with the digit '1'. The expected output will be printed to the console.

## Documentation

The function is straightforward and does not require additional documentation. The logic is implemented in the `main.py` file, which is self-contained and does not rely on any external libraries.
