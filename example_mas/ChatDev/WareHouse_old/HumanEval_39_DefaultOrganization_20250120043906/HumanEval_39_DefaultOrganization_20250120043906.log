Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and testing a piece of software code, I believe the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This would allow us to implement the necessary code in Python and ensure it functions correctly. What are your thoughts?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" is indeed the most appropriate modality for this task, as it involves developing and testing a specific piece of software code. This will allow us to focus on the functionality and correctness of the code.

To solve the task, we need to implement the `prime_fib` function in Python, which returns the n-th Fibonacci number that is also a prime number. We will not implement a GUI as the task explicitly states not to do so. The focus will be on writing the necessary code to achieve the desired functionality.

### Core Functions

1. **is_prime(num: int) -> bool**: 
   - Purpose: Check if a given number is prime.

2. **fibonacci_generator() -> int**: 
   - Purpose: Generate Fibonacci numbers indefinitely.

3. **prime_fib(n: int) -> int**: 
   - Purpose: Return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python
'''

This module contains the implementation of the prime_fib function, which returns the n-th Fibonacci number that is also a prime number.

            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return fib
```

### Explanation

- **is_prime**: This function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility.
- **fibonacci_generator**: This generator yields Fibonacci numbers indefinitely.
- **prime_fib**: This function uses the Fibonacci generator and the prime check function to find the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime.

This code should satisfy the requirements of the task by correctly implementing the `prime_fib` function.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Based on the provided code, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The code only utilizes Python's built-in functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, as there are no additional dependencies required for the project to run properly.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Prime Fibonacci Finder

This software provides a function to find the n-th Fibonacci number that is also a prime number. It is implemented in Python and does not require any external dependencies.

## Main Functions

### `prime_fib(n: int) -> int`

- **Description**: This function returns the n-th Fibonacci number that is also a prime number.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `n` (int): The position of the prime Fibonacci number to be returned.
- **Returns**: 
  - An integer representing the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime.
- **Example Usage**:
  ```python
  >>> prime_fib(1)
  2
  >>> prime_fib(2)
  3
  >>> prime_fib(3)
  5
  >>> prime_fib(4)
  13
  >>> prime_fib(5)
  89
  ```

## Installation

This software does not require any external libraries or dependencies beyond Python itself. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Ensure Python is installed**:
   - You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Run the script**:
   - You can directly run the `main.py` file using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Import the function**:
   - If you are using this function in another script, import it as follows:
   ```python
   from main import prime_fib
   ```

2. **Call the function**:
   - Use the `prime_fib` function to find the desired prime Fibonacci number:
   ```python
   result = prime_fib(5)
   print(result)  # Output will be 89
   ```

## Documentation

For further details on the implementation and usage, refer to the code comments and docstrings within the `main.py` file. The code is designed to be self-explanatory and easy to understand.
