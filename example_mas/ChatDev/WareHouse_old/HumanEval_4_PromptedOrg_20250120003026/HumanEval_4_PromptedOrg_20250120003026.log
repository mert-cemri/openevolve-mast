To solve the task, we need to implement the function `mean_absolute_deviation` which calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. The MAD is the average of the absolute differences between each number and the mean of the list.

Here are the steps to implement the function:

1. Calculate the mean of the list of numbers.
2. Compute the absolute difference between each number and the mean.
3. Calculate the average of these absolute differences to get the MAD.

Now, let's write the code for the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python

'''

This module contains a function to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers.

from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0
    """
    if not numbers:
        return 0.0
    
    mean_value = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    absolute_deviations = [abs(x - mean_value) for x in numbers]
    mad = sum(absolute_deviations) / len(numbers)
    
    return mad

```

This code defines the function `mean_absolute_deviation` which calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation of a list of numbers. It first checks if the list is empty and returns 0.0 if it is. Then, it calculates the mean of the numbers, computes the absolute deviations from the mean, and finally calculates the average of these deviations to return the MAD.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Since the provided code does not use any external libraries or packages, there are no specific dependencies required for the project to run. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty. Here is how it should look:

The Programmer is correct in their assessment. The provided code for calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation does not utilize any external libraries or packages, as it relies solely on Python's built-in functions and data structures. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, indicating that there are no external dependencies required for the project to run. Here is how the `requirements.txt` file should look:
