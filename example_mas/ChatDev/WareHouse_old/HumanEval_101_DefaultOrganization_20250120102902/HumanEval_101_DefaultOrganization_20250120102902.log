Given the task at hand, which involves writing a function to process a string and return an array of words, the most suitable product modality would be an Application. This is because the task requires implementing a software tool that processes data, which aligns with the capabilities of an Application. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. An Application is indeed the most suitable product modality for this task, as it involves writing and executing a piece of software code to process a string and return an array of words. This aligns well with the nature of an Application, which is designed to implement software tools.

To complete the task, we need to implement the function `words_string` that splits a string of words separated by commas or spaces into an array of words. The task specifically states not to implement a GUI interface, so we will focus solely on the function implementation in Python.

Here is the breakdown of the function we need:

- **Function Name**: `words_string`
- **Purpose**: To split a given string into words based on spaces and commas and return a list of words.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains the function words_string which splits a string of words separated by commas or spaces into a list of words.

'''

def words_string(s):
    """
    Splits a string of words separated by commas or spaces into a list of words.
    
    Args:
    s (str): A string of words separated by commas or spaces.
    
    Returns:
    list: A list of words.
    
    Examples:
    words_string("Hi, my name is John") -> ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") -> ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
    """
    # Replace commas with spaces and split the string by spaces
    return s.replace(',', ' ').split()

```

This implementation replaces commas with spaces and then splits the string by spaces to achieve the desired output. The function is simple and efficient for the given task.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

For the given task and code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `words_string` only uses basic string operations that are part of Python's standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed.

Here's how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given task and code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `words_string` only uses basic string operations that are part of Python's standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed.
Here's how the `requirements.txt` file would look:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```
This comment is optional, but it clarifies that the absence of dependencies is intentional. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I concur with the Programmer's assessment. The task at hand involves a simple function that utilizes basic string operations inherent to Python's standard library. Consequently, there are no external dependencies or packages required for this project. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, reflecting the absence of any additional dependencies.

Here's how the `requirements.txt` file should be structured:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

This comment is optional but serves to clarify that the lack of dependencies is intentional and not an oversight. This approach ensures that anyone reviewing the project understands that the function relies solely on Python's built-in capabilities.

# Words String Splitter

A simple Python utility to split a string of words separated by commas or spaces into a list of words.

## Overview

The Words String Splitter is a straightforward Python function designed to take a string input and return a list of words. This function is particularly useful for parsing sentences or phrases where words are separated by commas or spaces.

## Main Function

### `words_string(s)`
