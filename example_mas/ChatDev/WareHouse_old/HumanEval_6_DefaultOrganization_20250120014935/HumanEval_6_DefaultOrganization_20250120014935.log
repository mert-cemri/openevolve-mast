To address the task, we need to focus on implementing the `parse_nested_parens` function as described. The task explicitly states not to implement a GUI, so we will disregard the GUI-related instructions and focus solely on the function implementation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what needs to be done:

1. **Function Purpose**: The `parse_nested_parens` function takes a string of multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces and returns a list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group.

2. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Split the input string by spaces to get individual groups of parentheses.
   - For each group, calculate the maximum depth of nested parentheses.
   - Return a list of these maximum depths.

3. **Core Function**:
   - `parse_nested_parens`: This function will implement the logic to determine the nesting depth for each group of parentheses.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to parse nested parentheses and determine the maximum depth of nesting for each group.

'''

from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """ Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.
    For each of the group, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.
    E.g. (()()) has maximum two levels of nesting while ((())) has three.

    >>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
    [2, 3, 1, 3]
    """
    def max_depth(paren_group: str) -> int:
        depth = 0
        max_depth = 0
        for char in paren_group:
            if char == '(':
                depth += 1
                if depth > max_depth:
                    max_depth = depth
            elif char == ')':
                depth -= 1
        return max_depth

    groups = paren_string.split()
    return [max_depth(group) for group in groups]

```

This code defines the `parse_nested_parens` function, which calculates the maximum depth of nested parentheses for each group in the input string. The function `max_depth` is a helper function that computes the depth for a single group of parentheses. The main function splits the input string into groups and applies `max_depth` to each, returning the results as a list.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# Parse Nested Parentheses

This software provides a function to parse nested parentheses in a string and determine the maximum depth of nesting for each group of parentheses.

## Main Function

The main function provided by this software is `parse_nested_parens`, which takes a string of multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces and returns a list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group.

### Function Signature

```python
def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
```

### Example Usage

```python
>>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
[2, 3, 1, 3]
```

In this example, the function analyzes each group of parentheses and returns the maximum depth of nesting for each group.

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, so you can run it with a standard Python environment. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## How to Use

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.
3. Run a Python interpreter and import the function:

   ```bash
   python
   ```

4. Import the function and use it:

   ```python
   from main import parse_nested_parens
   result = parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
   print(result)  # Output: [2, 3, 1, 3]
   ```

## Documentation

The function `parse_nested_parens` is designed to be simple and efficient. It splits the input string by spaces to separate each group of parentheses, then calculates the maximum depth of nesting for each group using a helper function `max_depth`.

### Helper Function

- `max_depth(paren_group: str) -> int`: This function calculates the maximum depth of nested parentheses for a single group.

## Support

For any issues or questions, please contact the development team at ChatDev. We are committed to providing support and assistance for our software products.
