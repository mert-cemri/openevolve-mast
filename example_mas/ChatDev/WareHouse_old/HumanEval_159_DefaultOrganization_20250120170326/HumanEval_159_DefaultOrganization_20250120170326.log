As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To address the customer's task, we need to implement a function `eat` that calculates the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left after a rabbit eats. The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus solely on implementing the function in Python.

### Core Function

- **eat**: This function will take three parameters: `number` (the number of carrots already eaten), `need` (the number of carrots needed to eat), and `remaining` (the number of carrots left in stock). It will return a list containing the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left.

Now, let's implement the function in a single Python file named `main.py`.

MAIN.PY

```python
'''
This module contains the implementation of the eat function which calculates
the total number of carrots eaten by a rabbit and the number of carrots left
after eating.

Function:
    eat(number, need, remaining): Returns a list with the total number of carrots

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task:

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

    """
    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,
    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.

                                    the number of carrots left after your meals ]
    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.
    
    Example:
    * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]
    * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
    * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]

For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required, as the function `eat` is implemented using only standard Python features. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

This indicates that there are no additional packages needed for the project to run properly.

 <INFO> As the code provided for the `eat` function does not rely on any external libraries or packages, the `requirements.txt` file would indeed be empty. However, for completeness and to adhere to standard practices, you can include a `requirements.txt` file with a comment indicating that no external dependencies are required. Here is how it would look:

```

The function returns a list containing:
1. The total number of carrots eaten after the meal.
2. The number of carrots left after the meal.

### Example Usage

Here are some examples of how the `eat` function works:

- `eat(5, 6, 10)` returns `[11, 4]`
- `eat(4, 8, 9)` returns `[12, 1]`
- `eat(1, 10, 10)` returns `[11, 0]`
- `eat(2, 11, 5)` returns `[7, 0]`
