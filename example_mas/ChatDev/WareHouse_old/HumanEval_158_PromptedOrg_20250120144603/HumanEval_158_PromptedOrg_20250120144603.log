To solve the task, we need to implement a function `find_max` that takes a list of strings and returns the word with the maximum number of unique characters. If there are multiple words with the same number of unique characters, the function should return the one that comes first in lexicographical order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the implementation:

1. **Function Definition**: Define the function `find_max` that accepts a list of strings.
2. **Unique Character Count**: For each word in the list, calculate the number of unique characters using a set.
3. **Comparison Logic**: Keep track of the word with the maximum number of unique characters. If a new word has the same number of unique characters as the current maximum, compare them lexicographically.
4. **Return Result**: Return the word that satisfies the conditions.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

DOCSTRING

'''

def find_max(words):
    """Write a function that accepts a list of strings.
    The list contains different words. Return the word with maximum number
    of unique characters. If multiple strings have maximum number of unique
    characters, return the one which comes first in lexicographical order.

    find_max(["name", "of", "string"]) == "string"
    find_max(["name", "enam", "game"]) == "enam"
    find_max(["aaaaaaa", "bb" ,"cc"]) == "aaaaaaa"
    """
    max_word = ""
    max_unique_chars = 0

    for word in words:
        unique_chars = len(set(word))
        if unique_chars > max_unique_chars or (unique_chars == max_unique_chars and word < max_word):
            max_word = word
            max_unique_chars = unique_chars

    return max_word
```

This code defines the `find_max` function as required, ensuring it meets the specifications provided by the customer. The function iterates over the list of words, calculates the number of unique characters for each word, and determines the word with the maximum number of unique characters, considering lexicographical order in case of ties.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a conversation between two roles: Programmer: ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.

```
"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `find_max` only uses basic Python functionality, which is available in the standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should be empty or not include any specific packages.
Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

The Programmer is correct in their assessment. The provided code for the `find_max` function does not require any external libraries or packages beyond Python's standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty or contain a comment indicating that no external dependencies are required.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file should look:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

This file serves as documentation for the project, indicating that it relies solely on Python's built-in capabilities. If there are any future changes that introduce external dependencies, this file should be updated accordingly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

# Find Max User Manual

Welcome to the Find Max software! This tool is designed to help you find the word with the maximum number of unique characters from a list of strings. If multiple words have the same number of unique characters, the software will return the word that comes first in lexicographical order.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this software is encapsulated in the `find_max` function. This function accepts a list of strings and returns the word with the maximum number of unique characters. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

- **Input**: A list of strings.
- **Output**: A single string, which is the word with the maximum number of unique characters. If there is a tie, the word that comes first in lexicographical order is returned.

### Example Usage

```python
find_max(["name", "of", "string"])  # Returns "string"
find_max(["name", "enam", "game"])  # Returns "enam"
find_max(["aaaaaaa", "bb", "cc"])   # Returns "aaaaaaa"
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it simple to set up and use. You only need Python installed on your system to run the code.

### Steps to Install

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Obtain the code by cloning the repository or downloading it as a ZIP file.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code is located.

4. **Run the Code**: You can run the code directly using Python. For example, if the code is in a file named `main.py`, you can execute it by running:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Your List of Words**: Create a list of strings that you want to analyze.

2. **Call the `find_max` Function**: Pass your list of words to the `find_max` function to get the desired result.

3. **Interpret the Result**: The function will return the word with the maximum number of unique characters. If there is a tie, it will return the word that comes first in lexicographical order.

## Additional Information

- **No External Libraries Required**: This software is designed to be lightweight and does not require any additional Python packages.

- **Simple and Efficient**: The algorithm efficiently calculates the number of unique characters in each word and determines the result based on the criteria specified.

We hope you find this tool useful for your string analysis needs. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to reach out.
