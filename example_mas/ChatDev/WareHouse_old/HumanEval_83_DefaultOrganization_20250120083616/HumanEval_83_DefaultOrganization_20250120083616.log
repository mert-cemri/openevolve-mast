We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            
def starts_one_ends(n):

    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.
    """
.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To solve the given task, we need to implement the function `starts_one_ends(n)` that counts the number of n-digit positive integers that start or end with the digit '1'. Since the task explicitly states not to implement a GUI, we will focus solely on the logic required to solve the problem.

### Core Function

1. **Function: `starts_one_ends(n)`**
   - **Purpose**: Calculate the number of n-digit positive integers that either start or end with the digit '1'.
   - **Logic**: 
     - For n-digit numbers, the range is from \(10^{(n-1)}\) to \(10^n - 1\).
     - Count numbers starting with '1': These are numbers from \(10^{(n-1)}\) to \(2 \times 10^{(n-1)} - 1\).
     - Count numbers ending with '1': These are numbers that end in '1' within the n-digit range.
     - Avoid double-counting numbers that both start and end with '1'.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

### main.py

FILENAME

```python
'''

Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
positive integers that start or end with 1.

'''

def starts_one_ends(n):
    if n == 1:
        # For single-digit numbers, only '1' satisfies the condition
        return 1
    
    # Calculate the number of n-digit numbers starting with '1'
    start_with_one_count = 10**(n-1)
    
    # Calculate the number of n-digit numbers ending with '1'
    end_with_one_count = 9 * 10**(n-1) // 10
    
    # Calculate the number of n-digit numbers that both start and end with '1'
    start_and_end_with_one_count = 10**(n-2)
    
    # Total count is the sum of numbers starting with '1' and ending with '1'
    # minus those that are counted twice (start and end with '1')
    total_count = start_with_one_count + end_with_one_count - start_and_end_with_one_count
    
    return total_count

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(starts_one_ends(2))  # Example: for 2-digit numbers
```

This code calculates the number of n-digit integers that start or end with '1' by considering the range of numbers and avoiding double-counting those that both start and end with '1'. The function is efficient and works for any positive integer n.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The function `starts_one_ends` is implemented using basic Python operations and does not require any additional dependencies. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can create an empty one as follows:

```
# requirements.txt

# No external dependencies required for this project.
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any external Python packages.
