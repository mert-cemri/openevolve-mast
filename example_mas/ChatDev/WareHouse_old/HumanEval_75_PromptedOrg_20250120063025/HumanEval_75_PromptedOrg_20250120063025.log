To solve the task, we need to implement a function `is_multiply_prime(a)` that checks if a given number `a` is the product of exactly three prime numbers. The number `a` is guaranteed to be less than 100. 

Here are the steps and components needed:

1. **Function `is_prime(n)`**: A helper function to determine if a number `n` is prime.
2. **Function `is_multiply_prime(a)`**: The main function that checks if `a` is the product of exactly three prime numbers.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python

'''

This module contains a function to check if a given number is the product of exactly three prime numbers.

'''

def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def is_multiply_prime(a):
    """Return True if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers and False otherwise."""
    primes = [i for i in range(2, 100) if is_prime(i)]
    
    # Check combinations of three primes
    for i in range(len(primes)):
        for j in range(i, len(primes)):
            for k in range(j, len(primes)):
                if primes[i] * primes[j] * primes[k] == a:
                    return True
    return False

```

This code defines two functions: `is_prime` to check if a number is prime, and `is_multiply_prime` to check if a number is the product of exactly three prime numbers. The `is_multiply_prime` function generates a list of prime numbers less than 100 and checks all combinations of three primes to see if their product equals `a`. If such a combination is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages.

"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses standard Python libraries and functions. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for the sake of completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that no additional packages need to be installed for the project to function. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# is_multiply_prime User Manual

## Introduction

The `is_multiply_prime` function is a simple Python utility designed to determine if a given number is the product of exactly three prime numbers. This function is particularly useful for educational purposes, mathematical explorations, or any application where prime factorization is relevant.

## Main Functions

### is_prime(n)

- **Description**: This helper function checks if a given number `n` is a prime number.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `n` (int): The number to check for primality.
- **Returns**: 
  - `bool`: `True` if `n` is a prime number, `False` otherwise.

### is_multiply_prime(a)

- **Description**: This function checks if the given number `a` is the product of exactly three prime numbers.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `a` (int): The number to check.
- **Returns**: 
  - `bool`: `True` if `a` is the product of three prime numbers, `False` otherwise.

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository containing the `main.py` file to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

3. **Run the Script**: You can use the Python interpreter to run the script and test the function. For example:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Example Usage**: You can test the function by calling it with different numbers. For example, to check if 30 is the product of three prime numbers, you can modify the script to include:

   ```python
   print(is_multiply_prime(30))  # Output: True
   ```

5. **Modify and Extend**: Feel free to modify the script to test other numbers or integrate it into larger projects.

## Conclusion

The `is_multiply_prime` function is a straightforward tool for checking the prime factorization of numbers under 100. With no external dependencies, it is easy to integrate and use in various Python environments. Enjoy exploring the fascinating world of prime numbers!
