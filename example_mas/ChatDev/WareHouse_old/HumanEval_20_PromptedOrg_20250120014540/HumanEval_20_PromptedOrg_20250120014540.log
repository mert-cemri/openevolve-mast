Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and fixing software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application." This allows us to focus on implementing the necessary functionality in Python, which aligns with the customer's request for a code solution. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To solve the task, we need to implement the function `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of floating-point numbers and returns a tuple of two numbers that are closest to each other. The numbers should be returned in ascending order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Sort the List**: Sorting the list will help us easily find the closest elements because the closest elements will be adjacent in a sorted list.

2. **Initialize Variables**: We'll need to keep track of the minimum difference found and the pair of numbers that have this minimum difference.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: We'll iterate through the sorted list and calculate the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers.

4. **Update Closest Pair**: If the current difference is smaller than the previously recorded minimum difference, update the closest pair and the minimum difference.

5. **Return the Closest Pair**: After iterating through the list, return the pair of numbers with the smallest difference.

Now, let's implement this in the `main.py` file.

main.py

```python

'''

From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

'''

from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    # Sort the list to ensure closest elements are adjacent
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    
    # Initialize variables to store the minimum difference and the closest pair
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (sorted_numbers[0], sorted_numbers[1])
    
    # Iterate through the sorted list to find the closest pair
    for i in range(len(sorted_numbers) - 1):
        # Calculate the difference between adjacent numbers
        diff = sorted_numbers[i + 1] - sorted_numbers[i]
        
        # Update the closest pair if a smaller difference is found
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (sorted_numbers[i], sorted_numbers[i + 1])
    
    return closest_pair

```

This code should fulfill the requirements of the task by finding and returning the closest pair of numbers from the list.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses Python's built-in functions and types. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

If you anticipate adding dependencies in the future or want to maintain a standard project structure, you can include an empty `requirements.txt` file.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses Python's built-in functions and types. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
If you anticipate adding dependencies in the future or want to maintain a standard project structure, you can include an empty `requirements.txt` file. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Find Closest Elements

This software provides a function to find the two closest numbers in a list of floating-point numbers. The function returns these two numbers in ascending order.

## Main Functionality

The main function of this software is:

- **find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:** This function takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the two numbers that are closest to each other in the list. The numbers in the tuple are returned in ascending order.

### Example Usage

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    # Sort the list to ensure closest elements are adjacent
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    # Initialize variables to store the minimum difference and the closest pair
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (sorted_numbers[0], sorted_numbers[1])
    # Iterate through the sorted list to find the closest pair
    for i in range(len(sorted_numbers) - 1):
        # Calculate the difference between adjacent numbers
        diff = sorted_numbers[i + 1] - sorted_numbers[i]
        # Update the closest pair if a smaller difference is found
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (sorted_numbers[i], sorted_numbers[i + 1])
    return closest_pair

# Example
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))  # Output: (2.0, 2.2)
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]))  # Output: (2.0, 2.0)
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies. It is implemented purely in Python, and you can run it in any standard Python environment.

### Quick Install

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How to Use

1. **Prepare your environment:**
   - Make sure Python is installed on your system.

2. **Run the code:**
   - Copy the code provided in the example usage section into a Python file, e.g., `main.py`.

- **find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:** This function takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the two numbers that are closest to each other in the list. The numbers in the tuple are returned in ascending order.

### Example Usage

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    # Sort the list to ensure closest elements are adjacent
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    # Initialize variables to store the minimum difference and the closest pair
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (sorted_numbers[0], sorted_numbers[1])
    # Iterate through the sorted list to find the closest pair
    for i in range(len(sorted_numbers) - 1):
        # Calculate the difference between adjacent numbers
        diff = sorted_numbers[i + 1] - sorted_numbers[i]
        # Update the closest pair if a smaller difference is found
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (sorted_numbers[i], sorted_numbers[i + 1])
    return closest_pair

# Example
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))  # Output: (2.0, 2.2)
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]))  # Output: (2.0, 2.0)
```
