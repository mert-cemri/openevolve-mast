Given the task at hand, which involves writing a function to split a string into words, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task involves implementing a software tool using Python code, which aligns with the capabilities of an Application. What are your thoughts on this?

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `words_string` that takes a string as input and returns a list of words. The words in the input string can be separated by either commas or spaces. The function should handle both types of separators and return a clean list of words without any punctuation.

Here's the plan:

1. **Function Name**: `words_string`
   - **Purpose**: To split a given string into words based on commas and spaces and return a list of words.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python

'''

You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
to split the string into words and return an array of the words.

For example:
words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]

'''

def words_string(s):
    # Replace commas with spaces
    s = s.replace(',', ' ')
    # Split the string by spaces and filter out any empty strings
    words = [word for word in s.split() if word]
    return words

# Example usage:
# print(words_string("Hi, my name is John"))  # Output: ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
# print(words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six"))  # Output: ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]

```

This code will correctly split the input string into words, handling both commas and spaces as separators. The `replace` method is used to convert commas into spaces, and then the `split` method is used to split the string into words. The list comprehension filters out any empty strings that might result from consecutive spaces.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code only uses basic Python string operations, which are part of the standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, as there are no additional packages needed for the project to run properly.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
```
This empty file indicates that no external packages are required. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Words String Splitter

This software provides a simple utility function to split a string of words separated by commas or spaces into an array of individual words. It is designed to handle strings with mixed delimiters and return a clean list of words.

## Main Functionality

The primary function provided by this software is `words_string(s)`, which takes a single string input and returns a list of words. The function processes the string by replacing commas with spaces, splitting the string by spaces, and filtering out any empty strings that may result from consecutive spaces or trailing spaces.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import words_string

# Example 1
result1 = words_string("Hi, my name is John")
print(result1)  # Output: ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]

# Example 2
result2 = words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six")
print(result2)  # Output: ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
```

## Installation

This software is implemented in Python and does not require any external dependencies beyond the standard Python library. To use this software, ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**

   Change to the directory where the repository is cloned:

   ```bash
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**

   You can directly run the Python script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Import the Function:**

   Import the `words_string` function from the `main.py` file in your Python script.

   ```python
   from main import words_string
   ```

2. **Call the Function:**

   Pass a string to the `words_string` function to get a list of words.

   ```python
   words = words_string("Your, example string here")
   print(words)
   ```

## Documentation

This software is straightforward and does not require extensive documentation. The function is designed to handle typical use cases of splitting strings into words based on spaces and commas. For any additional information or support, please refer to the comments within the code or contact the development team.
