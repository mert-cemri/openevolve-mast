Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and correcting a piece of software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to focus on implementing the necessary logic in Python without any additional interfaces or formats. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree. An "Application" is the most appropriate modality for this task as it allows us to focus solely on the code implementation.

To solve the task, we need to implement the `correct_bracketing` function in Python. The task specifies that we should not implement a GUI, so we will focus solely on the function logic. The function should check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the given string. Here's how we can implement this:

1. **Function Name**: `correct_bracketing`
2. **Purpose**: To determine if a string of brackets is correctly balanced.
3. **Logic**:
   - Use a counter to track the balance of brackets.
   - Increment the counter for each opening bracket `(`.
   - Decrement the counter for each closing bracket `)`.
   - If the counter goes negative at any point, it means there's a closing bracket without a matching opening bracket.
   - At the end, the counter should be zero for the brackets to be balanced.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to check if a string of brackets is correctly balanced.

def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:

    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("(")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("()")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("(()())")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing(")(()")
    False
    """
    balance = 0
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == '(':
            balance += 1
        elif bracket == ')':
            balance -= 1
        # If balance goes negative, there is a closing bracket without a matching opening bracket
        if balance < 0:
            return False
    # If balance is zero, all opening brackets have matching closing brackets
    return balance == 0
```

This code defines the `correct_bracketing` function, which checks if the input string of brackets is balanced. The function uses a simple counter to track the balance of opening and closing brackets and returns `True` if they are balanced, otherwise `False`.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `correct_bracketing` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, to maintain the structure, you can create an empty `requirements.txt` file as follows:

```
# requirements.txt

# No external dependencies required for this project
```

This indicates that the project does not require any additional packages beyond the standard Python library.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `correct_bracketing` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, to maintain the structure, you can create an empty `requirements.txt` file as follows:
```
# requirements.txt

```
This indicates that the project does not require any additional packages beyond the standard Python library. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I understand the importance of ensuring that our project documentation is complete and accurate. Based on the information provided by the Programmer, the `main.py` file does not require any external dependencies or third-party libraries, as it only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should reflect this.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file for the project:

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Correct Bracketing

This software module provides a function to check if a string of brackets is correctly balanced. It is designed to ensure that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this module is `correct_bracketing`. This function takes a string of brackets as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the brackets are correctly balanced.

### Function: `correct_bracketing`

- **Input:** A string consisting of the characters `(` and `)`.
- **Output:** Returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, otherwise returns `False`.

#### Examples:

```python
>>> correct_bracketing("(")
False
>>> correct_bracketing("()")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("(()())")
True
>>> correct_bracketing(")(()")
False
```

## Installation

This project does not require any external dependencies. It is implemented purely in Python, and you can run it in any standard Python environment.
