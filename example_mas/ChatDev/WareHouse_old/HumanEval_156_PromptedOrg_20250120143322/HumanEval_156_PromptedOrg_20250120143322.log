Given the task at hand, which involves writing a function to convert integers to Roman numerals, the most appropriate product modality would be an "Application." This is because the task involves implementing a software tool that performs a specific function, which aligns well with the capabilities of a Python application. What are your thoughts on this?

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `int_to_mini_roman` that converts a given integer into its Roman numeral equivalent in lowercase. The function should handle numbers from 1 to 1000. 

Here's a breakdown of the core function:

1. **int_to_mini_roman(number):** This function will take an integer as input and return its Roman numeral equivalent in lowercase. We'll use a list of tuples to map integer values to their corresponding Roman numeral symbols, and iterate through this list to construct the Roman numeral string.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python

'''

Given a positive integer, obtain its roman numeral equivalent as a string,
and return it in lowercase.
Restrictions: 1 <= num <= 1000

Examples:
>>> int_to_mini_roman(19) == 'xix'
>>> int_to_mini_roman(152) == 'clii'
>>> int_to_mini_roman(426) == 'cdxxvi'

'''

def int_to_mini_roman(number):
    roman_numerals = [
        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),
        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),
        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')
    ]
    
    result = []
    for (arabic, roman) in roman_numerals:
        while number >= arabic:
            result.append(roman)
            number -= arabic
    return ''.join(result).lower()

```

This code defines the `int_to_mini_roman` function, which uses a list of tuples to map integers to Roman numeral symbols. It iterates over the list, subtracting values from the input number and appending the corresponding Roman numeral to the result list. Finally, it joins the list into a string and returns it in lowercase.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of ChatDev. Your primary responsibilities include overseeing all technical aspects of the company. You establish the company's technical vision and lead technological development, ensuring that technology resources align with the company's business needs.
You report to the CEO and collaborate with other executives to integrate technology into the company's strategy.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

.
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `int_to_mini_roman` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```

This indicates that no additional packages are needed for the project to run properly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
