To solve the task, we need to implement the `anti_shuffle` function in Python. The function should take a string and return an ordered version of it, where each word is sorted by its characters' ASCII values, while maintaining the order of words and spaces in the original string.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Function Name**: `anti_shuffle`
   - **Purpose**: To reorder the characters of each word in a string based on their ASCII values, while preserving the order of words and spaces.

2. **Steps to Implement**:
   - Split the input string into words and spaces.
   - Sort the characters of each word.
   - Reconstruct the string with sorted words and original spaces.

Now, let's write the code for the `main.py` file:

MAIN.PY

```python

'''

Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
ascending order based on ascii value.
Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

For example:
anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'
anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'
anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'

'''

def anti_shuffle(s):
    # Split the string into words and spaces
    words = s.split(' ')
    
    # Sort characters in each word
    sorted_words = [''.join(sorted(word)) for word in words]
    
    # Join the sorted words with spaces to reconstruct the sentence
    return ' '.join(sorted_words)

# Example usage
print(anti_shuffle('Hi'))  # Output: 'Hi'
print(anti_shuffle('hello'))  # Output: 'ehllo'
print(anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!'))  # Output: 'Hello !!!Wdlor'

```

This code implements the `anti_shuffle` function as described. It splits the input string by spaces, sorts each word's characters, and then joins them back together with spaces to form the final ordered string. The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how the function works with different inputs.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required, as it only uses Python's built-in functions and libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for the sake of completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

# Anti-Shuffle User Manual

Welcome to the Anti-Shuffle software! This tool is designed to take a string and return an ordered version of it, where all words are rearranged such that their characters are in ascending order based on ASCII value. The order of words and spaces in the sentence is preserved.

## Main Functionality

The primary function of this software is `anti_shuffle`, which processes a given string and returns a new string with each word's characters sorted in ascending order.

### Example Usage

- `anti_shuffle('Hi')` returns `'Hi'`
- `anti_shuffle('hello')` returns `'ehllo'`
- `anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!')` returns `'Hello !!!Wdlor'`

## Installation

This software is implemented in Python and does not require any external dependencies. You can run it in any environment that supports Python.

### Quick Install

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file to your local machine.

3. No additional installation steps are required as there are no external dependencies.

## How to Use

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

3. Run the Python script using the command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. You can modify the `main.py` file to test the `anti_shuffle` function with different input strings by changing the arguments in the `print` statements.

## Documentation

The `anti_shuffle` function is straightforward and does not require additional libraries or complex setup. The logic is encapsulated within the function, which splits the input string into words, sorts the characters in each word, and then reconstructs the sentence with the sorted words.

For further customization or integration into larger projects, you can import the `anti_shuffle` function from `main.py` into your own Python scripts.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please reach out to our support team.

Thank you for using Anti-Shuffle!
