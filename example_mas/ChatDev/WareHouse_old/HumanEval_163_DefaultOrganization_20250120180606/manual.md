# Generate Integers

A simple Python application to generate even integers between two given positive integers in ascending order.

## Overview

The `generate_integers` function takes two positive integers as input and returns a list of even integers between them, inclusive, sorted in ascending order. This function is useful for generating sequences of even numbers within a specified range.

### Example Usage

- `generate_integers(2, 8)` returns `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
- `generate_integers(8, 2)` returns `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
- `generate_integers(10, 14)` returns `[]`

## Installation

This application does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to set up and use. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - You can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

## How to Use

1. **Open the Script:**
   - Open the `main.py` file in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.

2. **Run the Function:**
   - You can call the `generate_integers` function with your desired input values. For example:
     ```python
     result = generate_integers(2, 8)
     print(result)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
     ```

3. **Modify Inputs:**
   - Feel free to modify the input values `a` and `b` to generate even integers for different ranges.

## Additional Information

- **Python Version:** Ensure you are using Python 3.x to run this script.
- **No External Libraries:** This script does not require any additional Python libraries beyond the standard library.
