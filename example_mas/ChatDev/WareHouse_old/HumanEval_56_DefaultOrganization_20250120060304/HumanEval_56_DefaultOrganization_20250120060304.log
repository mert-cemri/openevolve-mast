To complete the task, we need to implement the `correct_bracketing` function in Python. The function should check if every opening bracket "<" has a corresponding closing bracket ">". We will not implement a GUI as the task explicitly states not to do so. Therefore, we will focus solely on the logic required to solve the problem.

Let's break down the task:

1. **Function Name**: `correct_bracketing`
2. **Input**: A string consisting of "<" and ">".
3. **Output**: A boolean value indicating whether the brackets are correctly matched.

The logic to solve this problem involves using a counter to track the balance of brackets. We increment the counter for every "<" and decrement it for every ">". If the counter goes negative at any point, it means there's a closing bracket without a matching opening bracket. At the end, the counter should be zero for the brackets to be correctly matched.

Now, let's implement the code in a single file called `main.py`.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains the function correct_bracketing which checks if a string of brackets is correctly matched.

'''

def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """ brackets is a string of "<" and ">".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("<")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("<>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
    False
    """
    balance = 0
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "<":
            balance += 1
        elif bracket == ">":
            balance -= 1
        # If balance is negative, there are more closing brackets than opening
        if balance < 0:
            return False
    # If balance is zero, all opening brackets have been closed
    return balance == 0
```

This code defines the `correct_bracketing` function, which checks if the brackets in the input string are correctly matched. The function uses a balance counter to ensure that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

    False
    """
.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `correct_bracketing` only uses basic Python operations and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not require any additional packages beyond the standard Python library.

As the Chief Executive Officer, I agree with the Programmer's assessment. The function `correct_bracketing` is a simple implementation that does not require any external libraries or dependencies beyond the standard Python library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file can be left empty or contain a comment indicating that no external dependencies are needed. Here is how the `requirements.txt` file should look:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This ensures clarity and completeness in the project's documentation, even though no additional packages are necessary. If there are any future updates or additional features that require external libraries, the `requirements.txt` file can be updated accordingly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
