# Tribonacci Sequence Calculator

This software computes the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence based on a given non-negative integer n. The Tribonacci sequence is a variation of the Fibonacci sequence with a unique recurrence relation.

## Main Functions

The main function provided by this software is:

- `tri(n)`: Computes and returns a list of the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.

### Function Details

- **Parameters**: 
  - `n` (int): A non-negative integer indicating the number of terms to compute in the Tribonacci sequence.

- **Returns**: 
  - A list containing the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage of the tri function
print(tri(3))  # Output: [1, 3, 2, 8]
```

## Installation

### Environment Setup

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it simple to set up and use. You can run the code directly in any Python environment.

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.

3. **Run the Code**: Execute the `main.py` file using Python to see the Tribonacci sequence output.

```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Use

1. **Modify the Input**: Open the `main.py` file and modify the input parameter `n` in the `tri(n)` function call to compute the desired number of terms in the Tribonacci sequence.

2. **Execute the Script**: Run the script using Python to see the output list of the Tribonacci sequence.

3. **Interpret the Output**: The output will be a list of numbers representing the first n + 1 terms of the Tribonacci sequence.

## Additional Information

- **No External Libraries Required**: This software is designed to be lightweight and does not require any additional Python packages.

- **Customization**: Users can modify the code to change the initial conditions or the recurrence relation if needed for different variations of the Tribonacci sequence.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs!
