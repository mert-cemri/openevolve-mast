To solve the task, we need to implement the `anti_shuffle` function in Python. This function will take a string as input and return a new string where each word is sorted in ascending order based on ASCII values, while maintaining the original order of words and spaces.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Split the Input String**: We will split the input string into words and spaces. This can be done using regular expressions to ensure we keep track of spaces.

2. **Sort Each Word**: For each word, we will sort the characters in ascending order based on their ASCII values.

3. **Reconstruct the String**: We will then reconstruct the string by combining the sorted words and spaces in their original order.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the reconstructed string.

Now, let's implement this in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python

    # Use regular expression to split the string into words and spaces

    # Sort each word and keep spaces as they are
    sorted_parts = [''.join(sorted(part)) if not part.isspace() else part for part in parts]
    
    # Join the parts back together
    return ''.join(sorted_parts)

```

This code defines the `anti_shuffle` function, which processes the input string according to the specified requirements. It uses regular expressions to split the string into words and spaces, sorts each word, and then reconstructs the string while preserving the spaces.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

# Anti-Shuffle Function

This software provides a Python function named `anti_shuffle` that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it. Each word in the string is replaced by a new word where all the characters are arranged in ascending order based on ASCII value, while maintaining the order of words and spaces.

## Main Functionality

The main functionality of this software is to reorder the characters of each word in a given string based on their ASCII values. The function ensures that the order of words and spaces in the sentence is preserved.

### Example Usage

- `anti_shuffle('Hi')` returns `'Hi'`
- `anti_shuffle('hello')` returns `'ehllo'`
- `anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!')` returns `'Hello !!!Wdlor'`

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to use. You only need to have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or download the `main.py` file containing the `anti_shuffle` function.

3. **No additional packages are required**: Since there are no external dependencies, you don't need to install any packages via `pip` or `conda`.

## How to Use

1. **Open the `main.py` file**: This file contains the `anti_shuffle` function.

2. **Call the `anti_shuffle` function**: You can call this function with any string input to get the ordered version of the string.

   ```python
   from main import anti_shuffle

   result = anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!')
   print(result)  # Output: 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
   ```

3. **Modify as needed**: You can modify the input string to test different cases and see how the function orders the characters.

## Documentation

For further details on how the function works, you can refer to the comments within the `main.py` file. The function uses regular expressions to split the string into words and spaces, sorts each word, and then joins the parts back together to form the final ordered string.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs!
