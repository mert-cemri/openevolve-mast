Given the task at hand, which involves writing and fixing a piece of software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task is focused on implementing a functional piece of code, which aligns with the creation of software or tools. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To solve the task, we need to implement the `is_sorted` function in Python. The function should check if a list of integers is sorted in ascending order and ensure that no number appears more than twice consecutively. Since the task specifies not to implement a GUI, we will focus solely on the logic required for the function.

Let's outline the core function:

1. **Function: `is_sorted(lst)`**
   - **Purpose**: Determine if the list `lst` is sorted in ascending order and contains no more than one duplicate of any number consecutively.
   - **Logic**:
     - Iterate through the list and check if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
     - Count consecutive duplicates and ensure no number appears more than twice consecutively.

Now, let's write the code for the `is_sorted` function in a single Python file named `main.py`.

MAIN.PY

```python
'''
Given a list of numbers, return whether or not they are sorted
in ascending order. If list has more than 1 duplicate of the same
number, return False. Assume no negative numbers and only integers.

Examples
is_sorted([5]) ➞ True
is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) ➞ True
is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5]) ➞ False
is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) ➞ True
is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) ➞ True
is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]) ➞ False
is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]) ➞ True
is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]) ➞ False
'''

def is_sorted(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return True

    duplicate_count = 1

    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        if lst[i] < lst[i - 1]:
            return False
        if lst[i] == lst[i - 1]:
            duplicate_count += 1
            if duplicate_count > 2:
                return False
        else:
            duplicate_count = 1

    return True
```

This code defines the `is_sorted` function, which checks if the list is sorted in ascending order and ensures that no number appears more than twice consecutively. The function iterates through the list, comparing each element with the previous one to maintain the order and count duplicates.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The code has a logical flaw in handling duplicates. The requirement is to return `False` if there is more than 1 duplicate of the same number. However, the current implementation returns `False` if there are more than 2 duplicates. The logic should be adjusted to return `False` if any number appears more than twice.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return True
    duplicate_count = 1
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        if lst[i] < lst[i - 1]:
            return False
        if lst[i] == lst[i - 1]:
            duplicate_count += 1
            if duplicate_count > 1:
                return False
        else:
            duplicate_count = 0
    return True
```

This revision ensures that the function returns `False` if any number appears more than once, which aligns with the task requirements.

Comments on Codes:
"The code has a logical flaw in handling duplicates. The requirement is to return `False` if there is more than 1 duplicate of the same number. However, the current implementation returns `False` if there are more than 2 duplicates. The logic should be adjusted to return `False` if any number appears more than twice.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return True
    duplicate_count = 1
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        if lst[i] < lst[i - 1]:
            return False
        if lst[i] == lst[i - 1]:
            duplicate_count += 1
            if duplicate_count > 1:
                return False
        else:
            duplicate_count = 0
    return True
```

This revision ensures that the function returns `False` if any number appears more than once, which aligns with the task requirements."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the given task and code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `is_sorted` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for the sake of completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

This indicates that the project does not require any additional packages beyond the standard Python library.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given task and code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `is_sorted` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for the sake of completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```
This indicates that the project does not require any additional packages beyond the standard Python library. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I agree with the Programmer's assessment. The provided code for the `is_sorted` function does not require any external libraries or packages beyond the standard Python library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would indeed be empty. However, for the sake of completeness and to adhere to standard practices, we can include a `requirements.txt` file with a comment indicating that no additional packages are needed. Here is how it would look:

```

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

# is_sorted Function User Manual

## Introduction

The `is_sorted` function is a simple utility designed to determine whether a given list of integers is sorted in ascending order. Additionally, it checks for duplicates and returns `False` if any number appears more than once consecutively. This function is useful for validating data sequences where order and uniqueness are important.

## Main Functionality

- **Check Ascending Order**: The function verifies if the numbers in the list are in non-decreasing order.
- **Duplicate Check**: It ensures that no number appears more than once consecutively in the list.

## Installation

This project does not require any external dependencies. It is implemented purely in Python, and you can run it in any standard Python environment.

### Quick Setup

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
