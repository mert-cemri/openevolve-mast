Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and fixing code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application" since it allows for implementing software or tools via Python. This aligns with the customer's requirement to solve a programming task. What are your thoughts on this?

To solve the task, we need to implement the `prime_fib` function that returns the n-th Fibonacci number that is also a prime number. We will not implement a GUI as per the initial task requirements, and we will focus solely on the logic needed to achieve the desired functionality.

### Core Functions

1. **is_prime(num: int) -> bool**: 
   - Purpose: Check if a given number is prime.
   
2. **fibonacci_generator() -> int**: 
   - Purpose: Generate Fibonacci numbers indefinitely.
   
3. **prime_fib(n: int) -> int**: 
   - Purpose: Return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also a prime number.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

### Explanation

- **is_prime**: This function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility.
- **fibonacci_generator**: This generator function yields Fibonacci numbers indefinitely.
- **prime_fib**: This function uses the Fibonacci generator and checks each number for primality. It counts how many prime Fibonacci numbers have been found and returns the n-th one.

This code is designed to be efficient and concise, focusing on generating Fibonacci numbers and checking their primality until the desired count is reached.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code uses only Python's built-in functions and libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

# Prime Fibonacci Finder

This software provides a function to find the n-th Fibonacci number that is also a prime number. It is a simple Python script designed to be efficient and easy to use.

## Main Functions

The main function of this software is `prime_fib(n: int) -> int`, which returns the n-th Fibonacci number that is also a prime number. The function uses a generator to produce Fibonacci numbers and checks each one for primality until it finds the desired count of prime Fibonacci numbers.

### Key Components

- **`is_prime(num: int) -> bool`**: A helper function that checks if a given number is prime.
- **`fibonacci_generator()`**: A generator function that yields Fibonacci numbers indefinitely.
- **`prime_fib(n: int) -> int`**: The main function that returns the n-th prime Fibonacci number.

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies. It is implemented using standard Python libraries, making it easy to set up and run.

### Quick Install

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file to your local machine.

3. No additional installation steps are required as there are no external dependencies.

## Usage

To use the software, simply run the `main.py` script. You can test the `prime_fib` function using the built-in doctests.

### Running the Script

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

3. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

This will execute the doctests included in the script, verifying that the `prime_fib` function works as expected.

### Example Usage

You can also use the `prime_fib` function directly in your Python code:

```python
from main import prime_fib

# Get the 5th prime Fibonacci number
result = prime_fib(5)
print(result)  # Output: 89
```

## Documentation

For further documentation, you can refer to the docstrings provided in the code. These docstrings include examples and explanations of how each function works.

This software is designed to be simple and straightforward, making it easy for developers to integrate the `prime_fib` function into their own projects or use it for educational purposes.
