# Get Max Triples

This software provides a function to calculate the number of valid triples in an array generated by a specific formula, where the sum of the triple is a multiple of 3.

## Main Function

### `get_max_triples(n)`

- **Description**: 
  - This function generates an integer array `a` of length `n` using the formula: `a[i] = i * i - i + 1` for each `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n).
  - It returns the number of triples `(a[i], a[j], a[k])` where `i < j < k`, and the sum `a[i] + a[j] + a[k]` is a multiple of 3.

- **Parameters**:
  - `n` (int): A positive integer representing the length of the array.

- **Returns**:
  - `int`: The number of valid triples where the sum is a multiple of 3.

- **Example**:
  ```python
  print(get_max_triples(5))  # Output: 1
  ```

## Installation

### Environment Setup

To use this software, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This software does not require any external Python packages. However, it's always a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can set up a virtual environment using the following steps:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Since there are no external dependencies, you can skip this step.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will run the example usage of the `get_max_triples` function with `n = 5`, and you should see the output `1`.
