To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To solve the task, we need to implement the `correct_bracketing` function in Python. The function should check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the given string. We will not implement a GUI as per the customer's task requirements, which specifically state not to implement anything redundant.

Here's the plan for the function:

1. **Function Name**: `correct_bracketing`
2. **Purpose**: To check if a string of brackets is correctly bracketed.
3. **Parameters**: A single string `brackets` consisting of '(' and ')'.
4. **Return**: Boolean value `True` if the brackets are correctly matched, otherwise `False`.

The logic to solve this problem involves using a counter to track the balance of opening and closing brackets. We will increment the counter for each opening bracket and decrement it for each closing bracket. If at any point the counter goes negative, it means there is a closing bracket without a matching opening bracket. At the end, the counter should be zero for the brackets to be correctly matched.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file:

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains the function correct_bracketing which checks if a string of brackets is correctly bracketed.

'''

def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    brackets is a string of "(" and ")".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("(")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("()")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("(()())")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing(")(()")
    False
    """
    balance = 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        elif char == ')':
            balance -= 1
        # If balance is negative, there are more closing brackets than opening ones
        if balance < 0:
            return False
    # If balance is zero, all opening brackets have been closed
    return balance == 0
```

This code should correctly solve the problem as specified by the customer. The function `correct_bracketing` will return `True` if the brackets are correctly matched and `False` otherwise.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `correct_bracketing` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, to maintain the structure, you can create an empty `requirements.txt` file as follows:

```
# requirements.txt

# No external dependencies required for this project.
```

This indicates that the project does not require any additional packages beyond the standard Python library.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `correct_bracketing` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, to maintain the structure, you can create an empty `requirements.txt` file as follows:
```
# requirements.txt
# No external dependencies required for this project.
```
This indicates that the project does not require any additional packages beyond the standard Python library. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I understand the importance of ensuring that our project documentation is complete and accurate. Given the information provided by the Programmer, it is clear that the `correct_bracketing` function does not require any external libraries or dependencies beyond the standard Python library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project will be empty, indicating no additional packages are needed.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file should look:

```

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha
