Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and fixing a piece of software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a solution in Python, which aligns with the capabilities of an application that can execute and demonstrate the functionality of the code. What are your thoughts on this?

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `words_string` that takes a string as input and returns a list of words. The words in the input string can be separated by either commas or spaces. We will use Python's string manipulation capabilities to achieve this.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the implementation:

1. **Function Name**: `words_string`
   - **Purpose**: To split a given string into words based on commas or spaces and return a list of these words.

2. **Approach**:
   - Replace commas in the string with spaces to unify the separators.
   - Use the `split()` method to split the string into words based on spaces.
   - Return the resulting list of words.

Now, let's write the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to split a string into words based on commas or spaces.

'''

def words_string(s):
    """
    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
    
    For example:
    words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
    """
    # Replace commas with spaces
    s = s.replace(',', ' ')
    # Split the string by spaces and filter out any empty strings
    words = s.split()
    return words
```

This code defines the `words_string` function, which processes the input string by replacing commas with spaces and then splitting the string into words using the `split()` method. The `split()` method, when used without any arguments, automatically handles multiple spaces and trims leading and trailing spaces, ensuring that we get a clean list of words.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a conversation between two roles: Programmer: ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.

"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `words_string` only uses basic string operations that are part of Python's standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, as no additional packages are needed for this project.
Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:
```
```
This indicates that there are no external dependencies for this project. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

The Programmer is correct in their assessment. The code provided in `main.py` does not require any external libraries or packages beyond Python's standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, as there are no additional dependencies needed for this project.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
```

This empty file indicates that there are no external dependencies required for the project to run properly. If there are any future updates or changes that introduce new dependencies, the `requirements.txt` file should be updated accordingly.

# Words String Splitter

This software module provides a simple function to split a string of words separated by commas or spaces into an array of words. It is designed to handle strings with mixed delimiters and return a clean list of words.

## Main Functionality

The primary function of this module is `words_string(s)`, which takes a single string input and returns a list of words. The function processes the input string by replacing commas with spaces and then splitting the string based on spaces. This ensures that all words are correctly extracted, regardless of whether they are separated by commas or spaces.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import words_string

# Example 1
result1 = words_string("Hi, my name is John")
print(result1)  # Output: ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]

# Example 2
result2 = words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six")
print(result2)  # Output: ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
```

## Installation

There are no external dependencies required for this module, so you can directly use it in your Python environment. Simply ensure that you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository containing the `main.py` file.

2. **Run the Code**: Use the function `words_string(s)` in your Python scripts as shown in the example usage above.

## Documentation

### Function: `words_string(s)`

- **Input**: A string `s` containing words separated by commas or spaces.
- **Output**: A list of words extracted from the input string.

The function works by:
1. Replacing all commas in the string with spaces.
2. Splitting the modified string by spaces.
3. Filtering out any empty strings that may result from consecutive spaces.

This approach ensures that the output is a clean list of words without any empty entries.

## Additional Information

For any further questions or support, please contact our support team or refer to the documentation provided within the code comments. This module is designed to be straightforward and easy to integrate into any Python project that requires basic string manipulation for word extraction.
