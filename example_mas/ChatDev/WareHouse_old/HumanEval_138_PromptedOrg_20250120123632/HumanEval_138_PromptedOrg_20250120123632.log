To solve the task, we need to implement a function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` that checks if a given number `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. 

### Core Function:
- **Function Name:** `is_equal_to_sum_even`
  - **Purpose:** To determine if a number `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers.
  - **Logic:** 
    - A positive even number can be represented as `2k` where `k` is a positive integer.
    - The smallest sum of four positive even numbers is `2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8`.
    - Therefore, for any number less than 8, it is impossible to express it as the sum of four positive even numbers.
    - For numbers 8 and above, it is always possible to express them as the sum of four positive even numbers by adjusting the values of `k`.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python

'''

Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.
Example:
is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False
is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False
is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True

'''

def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    # The smallest sum of four positive even numbers is 8 (2+2+2+2)
    # Therefore, any number less than 8 cannot be expressed as such a sum
    return n >= 8

# Example usage:
# print(is_equal_to_sum_even(4))  # Output: False
# print(is_equal_to_sum_even(6))  # Output: False
# print(is_equal_to_sum_even(8))  # Output: True

```

This implementation checks if the number `n` is greater than or equal to 8. If it is, then it can be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers; otherwise, it cannot.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True
    """
.
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The current implementation of the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` is incorrect. It only checks if the number is greater than or equal to 8, which is not sufficient to determine if a number can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. The logic should ensure that the number can be decomposed into four positive even numbers, which means it should be an even number itself and at least 8.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
Modify the function to check if the number is both even and greater than or equal to 8.

```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    # The smallest sum of four positive even numbers is 8 (2+2+2+2)
    # Therefore, any number less than 8 cannot be expressed as such a sum
    # Additionally, the number must be even to be expressed as a sum of even numbers
    return n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0
```

This change ensures that the function correctly evaluates whether a number can be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".
