To solve the task, we need to implement the function `mean_absolute_deviation` in Python. This function will calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. The MAD is the average of the absolute differences between each number and the mean of the dataset.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Calculate the Mean**: First, compute the mean (average) of the list of numbers.
2. **Calculate Absolute Deviations**: For each number in the list, calculate the absolute difference between the number and the mean.
3. **Compute the Mean of Absolute Deviations**: Finally, calculate the mean of these absolute differences.

Now, let's implement this in the `main.py` file.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating-point numbers.
        
    Returns:
        float: The mean absolute deviation of the numbers.
    
    Example:
        >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])

    """
    if not numbers:
        return 0.0
    
    mean_value = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    absolute_deviations = [abs(x - mean_value) for x in numbers]
    mad = sum(absolute_deviations) / len(numbers)
    
    return mad
```

This code defines the function `mean_absolute_deviation`, which calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation of a list of numbers. It first checks if the list is empty, returning 0.0 if so. Then, it calculates the mean of the numbers, computes the absolute deviations, and finally returns the mean of these deviations.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The Programmer is correct in their assessment. The provided code for the `mean_absolute_deviation` function only uses built-in Python functionalities and does not require any external libraries or packages. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would indeed be empty. However, including a comment for clarity is a good practice. Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)
