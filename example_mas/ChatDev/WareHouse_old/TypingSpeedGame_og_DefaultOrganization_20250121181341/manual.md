# Typing Practice Game

Welcome to the Typing Practice Game! This application is designed to help users improve their typing speed and accuracy through engaging practice sessions. The game displays random words or phrases that the user must type within a set time limit. At the end of the session, the game calculates and displays the user's words-per-minute (WPM) and accuracy percentage.

## Main Features

- **Random Word Display**: The game displays random words or phrases for the user to type.
- **Typing Speed Measurement**: Calculates the user's typing speed in words-per-minute (WPM).
- **Accuracy Calculation**: Measures the accuracy of the user's typing as a percentage.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive GUI built using Tkinter.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Tkinter library (usually included with Python standard library).

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the project repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: This project does not require any external dependencies beyond Python and Tkinter. Ensure your Python environment is set up correctly.

   ```bash
   # No additional installation needed
   ```

3. **Prepare Word List**: Ensure the `words.txt` file is in the same directory as the Python scripts. This file contains the words or phrases used in the game.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the `main.py` script to launch the game.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Game Interface**: A window will open displaying a word or phrase. Type the word in the input field and press Enter.

3. **Typing Session**: Continue typing the displayed words until the time runs out (default is 60 seconds).

4. **View Results**: After the session ends, your WPM and accuracy percentage will be displayed.

5. **Repeat**: You can close the window and restart the game to try again and improve your scores.

## Troubleshooting

- **GUI Issues**: If the GUI does not start, ensure you have a display environment available and that Tkinter is properly installed.
- **Word List**: If the game does not display words, check that `words.txt` is in the correct directory and contains valid entries.
