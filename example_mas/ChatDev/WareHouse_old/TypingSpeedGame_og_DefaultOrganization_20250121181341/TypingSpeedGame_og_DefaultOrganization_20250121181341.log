Given the nature of the task, which involves creating a typing practice game that measures speed and accuracy, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to implement the interactive and visual elements necessary for a game, and Python is a versatile language for developing such applications. What are your thoughts on this?

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a typing practice game that measures speed and accuracy. The program displays words or phrases randomly, and the user types them within a set time. It calculates words-per-minute (WPM) and accuracy percentage, displaying final results at the end..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Create a typing practice game that measures speed and accuracy. The program displays words or phrases randomly, and the user types them within a set time. It calculates words-per-minute (WPM) and accuracy percentage, displaying final results at the end.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To create a typing practice game with a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python, we will use the `tkinter` library for the GUI. The application will consist of multiple files to maintain a clean architecture. Here is an outline of the core classes and functions:

1. **main.py**: This will be the entry point of the application.
   - `TypingGame`: Class to manage the game logic and GUI.
   - `start_game()`: Method to initialize and start the game.
   - `display_word()`: Method to display a random word or phrase.
   - `check_input()`: Method to check user input against the displayed word.
   - `calculate_results()`: Method to calculate WPM and accuracy.

2. **utils.py**: Utility functions for the game.
   - `load_words()`: Function to load words or phrases from a file or list.
   - `calculate_wpm()`: Function to calculate words per minute.
   - `calculate_accuracy()`: Function to calculate typing accuracy.

3. **words.txt**: A text file containing words or phrases for the game.

Let's start with the implementation:

### main.py

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a typing practice game that measures speed and accuracy. The program displays words or phrases randomly, and the user types them within a set time. It calculates words-per-minute (WPM) and accuracy percentage, displaying final results at the end..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a critical issue: the game does not have a mechanism to end and display the results after a set time, which is a key requirement. Currently, the game continues indefinitely without calculating and displaying the final results.

To fix this, you can implement a timer that stops the game after a specified duration (e.g., 60 seconds) and then calls the `calculate_results` method to display the WPM and accuracy. Here's how you can modify the code:

1. Add a duration parameter to the `TypingGame` class to specify the game duration.
2. Implement a method to check the elapsed time and end the game when the time is up.

Here's a suggested modification:

```python
class TypingGame:
    def __init__(self, master, duration=60):
        self.master = master
        self.master.title("Typing Practice Game")
        self.words = load_words()
        self.current_word = ""
        self.start_time = 0
        self.typed_words = []
        self.correct_words = 0
        self.duration = duration  # Duration in seconds
        self.label = tk.Label(master, text="", font=("Helvetica", 24))
        self.label.pack(pady=20)
        self.entry = tk.Entry(master, font=("Helvetica", 24))
        self.entry.pack(pady=20)
        self.entry.bind("<Return>", self.check_input)
        self.result_label = tk.Label(master, text="", font=("Helvetica", 18))
        self.result_label.pack(pady=20)
        self.start_game()

    def start_game(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        self.display_word()
        self.master.after(1000, self.check_time)  # Check time every second

    def display_word(self):
        self.current_word = random.choice(self.words)
        self.label.config(text=self.current_word)
        self.entry.delete(0, tk.END)

    def check_input(self, event):
        typed_word = self.entry.get().strip()
        self.typed_words.append(typed_word)
        if typed_word == self.current_word:
            self.correct_words += 1
        self.display_word()

    def check_time(self):
        elapsed_time = time.time() - self.start_time
        if elapsed_time >= self.duration:
            self.calculate_results()
        else:
            self.master.after(1000, self.check_time)

    def calculate_results(self):
        end_time = time.time()
        elapsed_time = end_time - self.start_time
        wpm = calculate_wpm(self.typed_words, elapsed_time)
        accuracy = calculate_accuracy(self.typed_words, self.correct_words)
        self.result_label.config(text=f"WPM: {wpm}, Accuracy: {accuracy}%")
        self.entry.config(state='disabled')  # Disable entry after game ends
```

This modification ensures the game ends after the specified duration and displays the results, fulfilling the user's requirements.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a critical issue: the game does not have a mechanism to end and display the results after a set time, which is a key requirement. Currently, the game continues indefinitely without calculating and displaying the final results.

To fix this, you can implement a timer that stops the game after a specified duration (e.g., 60 seconds) and then calls the `calculate_results` method to display the WPM and accuracy. Here's how you can modify the code:

1. Add a duration parameter to the `TypingGame` class to specify the game duration.
2. Implement a method to check the elapsed time and end the game when the time is up.

Here's a suggested modification:

```python
class TypingGame:
    def __init__(self, master, duration=60):
        self.master = master
        self.master.title("Typing Practice Game")
        self.words = load_words()
        self.current_word = ""
        self.start_time = 0
        self.typed_words = []
        self.correct_words = 0
        self.duration = duration  # Duration in seconds
        self.label = tk.Label(master, text="", font=("Helvetica", 24))
        self.label.pack(pady=20)
        self.entry = tk.Entry(master, font=("Helvetica", 24))
        self.entry.pack(pady=20)
        self.entry.bind("<Return>", self.check_input)
        self.result_label = tk.Label(master, text="", font=("Helvetica", 18))
        self.result_label.pack(pady=20)
        self.start_game()

    def start_game(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        self.display_word()
        self.master.after(1000, self.check_time)  # Check time every second

    def display_word(self):
        self.current_word = random.choice(self.words)
        self.label.config(text=self.current_word)
        self.entry.delete(0, tk.END)

    def check_input(self, event):
        typed_word = self.entry.get().strip()
        self.typed_words.append(typed_word)
        if typed_word == self.current_word:
            self.correct_words += 1
        self.display_word()

    def check_time(self):
        elapsed_time = time.time() - self.start_time
        if elapsed_time >= self.duration:
            self.calculate_results()
        else:
            self.master.after(1000, self.check_time)

    def calculate_results(self):
        end_time = time.time()
        elapsed_time = end_time - self.start_time
        wpm = calculate_wpm(self.typed_words, elapsed_time)
        accuracy = calculate_accuracy(self.typed_words, self.correct_words)
        self.result_label.config(text=f"WPM: {wpm}, Accuracy: {accuracy}%")
        self.entry.config(state='disabled')  # Disable entry after game ends
```

This modification ensures the game ends after the specified duration and displays the results, fulfilling the user's requirements."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the calculation of Words Per Minute (WPM). The current implementation counts every typed word, regardless of whether it is correct or not, which may not accurately reflect the user's typing speed. Typically, WPM is calculated based on correctly typed words. Here's how you can fix this:

### Comment with Highest Priority:
The calculation of Words Per Minute (WPM) should be based on the number of correctly typed words, not the total number of typed words.

### Suggestions on Revision:
1. Modify the `calculate_wpm` function in `utils.py` to use the `correct_words` count instead of the total `typed_words` count.

```python
def calculate_wpm(correct_words, elapsed_time):
    minutes = elapsed_time / 60
    wpm = correct_words / minutes
    return round(wpm, 2)
```

2. Update the call to `calculate_wpm` in the `calculate_results` method of the `TypingGame` class to pass `self.correct_words` instead of `self.typed_words`.

```python
wpm = calculate_wpm(self.correct_words, elapsed_time)
```

By making these changes, the WPM calculation will more accurately reflect the user's typing speed based on correctly typed words.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the calculation of Words Per Minute (WPM). The current implementation counts every typed word, regardless of whether it is correct or not, which may not accurately reflect the user's typing speed. Typically, WPM is calculated based on correctly typed words. Here's how you can fix this:

### Comment with Highest Priority:
The calculation of Words Per Minute (WPM) should be based on the number of correctly typed words, not the total number of typed words.

### Suggestions on Revision:
1. Modify the `calculate_wpm` function in `utils.py` to use the `correct_words` count instead of the total `typed_words` count.

```python
def calculate_wpm(correct_words, elapsed_time):
    minutes = elapsed_time / 60
    wpm = correct_words / minutes
    return round(wpm, 2)
```

2. Update the call to `calculate_wpm` in the `calculate_results` method of the `TypingGame` class to pass `self.correct_words` instead of `self.typed_words`.

```python
wpm = calculate_wpm(self.correct_words, elapsed_time)
```

By making these changes, the WPM calculation will more accurately reflect the user's typing speed based on correctly typed words."

Modify the calculate_wpm function in utils.py to use the correct_words count instead of the total typed_words count.\n\npython\ndef calculate_wpm(correct_words, elapsed_time):\n    minutes = elapsed_time / 60\n    wpm = correct_words / minutes\n    return round(wpm, 2)\n\n\n2.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The error message you encountered is related to the use of the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python. The specific error is:

```
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This error typically occurs when you try to run a Tkinter application on a system that does not have a graphical display environment set up. This is common when running the code on a remote server or in an environment without a graphical interface, such as a headless server or a Docker container without GUI support.

Here is a summary of the issue and potential solutions:

1. **Issue**: The Tkinter library requires a graphical display to render the GUI. The error indicates that the environment variable `$DISPLAY` is not set, which means the system does not know where to render the GUI.

2. **Solutions**:
   - **Run Locally**: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical interface where Tkinter can open a window.
   - **Set Up a Virtual Display**: Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to create a virtual display environment. This is useful for running GUI applications in environments without a physical display.
     - Install Xvfb: `sudo apt-get install xvfb`
     - Run your script with Xvfb: `xvfb-run python main.py`
   - **Use a Remote Desktop**: If you are on a remote server, consider using a remote desktop solution that supports GUI applications, such as VNC or RDP.

By addressing the environment setup, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the `$DISPLAY` error.

   - **Set Up a Virtual Display**: Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to create a virtual display environment. This is useful for running GUI applications in environments without a physical display.
     - Install Xvfb: `sudo apt-get install xvfb`
     - Run your script with Xvfb: `xvfb-run python main.py`
   - **Use a Remote Desktop**: If you are on a remote server, consider using a remote desktop solution that supports GUI applications, such as VNC or RDP.

By addressing the environment setup, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the `$DISPLAY` error.

Solutions:\n   - Run Locally: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical interface where Tkinter can open a window.\n   - Set Up a Virtual Display: Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to create a virtual display environment. This is useful for running GUI applications in environments without a physical display.\n     - Install Xvfb: sudo apt-get install xvfb\n     - Run your script with Xvfb: xvfb-run python main.py\n   - Use a Remote Desktop: If you are on a remote server, consider using a remote desktop solution that supports GUI applications, such as VNC or RDP.\n\nBy addressing the environment setup, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the $DISPLAY error.'} |

The error message you encountered is related to the use of the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python. The specific error, `_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable`, indicates that the program is trying to create a GUI window but cannot find a display environment to render it. This typically occurs when you attempt to run a Tkinter application on a system without a graphical display environment, such as a remote server or a headless environment.

Here are the key points to address the issue:

1. **Display Environment**: Ensure that you are running the program on a system with a graphical display environment. If you are running it on a remote server, you may need to use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to simulate a display.

2. **Local Machine**: If you are running the code on your local machine and still encountering this error, make sure that your graphical environment is properly set up and that you have the necessary permissions to access the display.

3. **Remote Access**: If you are accessing a remote machine via SSH, ensure that you have enabled X11 forwarding by using the `-X` or `-Y` option with the SSH command. This allows GUI applications to be displayed on your local machine.

4. **Environment Variables**: Check if the `$DISPLAY` environment variable is set correctly. It should point to the display server you intend to use.

By addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the issue and run the Tkinter application successfully. If you are working in a headless environment and cannot use a GUI, you might need to consider alternative ways to test the application, such as using a different interface or running it on a local machine with a display.

"The error message you encountered is related to the use of the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python. The specific error, `_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable`, indicates that the program is trying to create a GUI window but cannot find a display environment to render it. This typically occurs when you attempt to run a Tkinter application on a system without a graphical display environment, such as a remote server or a headless environment.

Here are the key points to address the issue:

1. **Display Environment**: Ensure that you are running the program on a system with a graphical display environment. If you are running it on a remote server, you may need to use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to simulate a display.

2. **Local Machine**: If you are running the code on your local machine and still encountering this error, make sure that your graphical environment is properly set up and that you have the necessary permissions to access the display.

4. **Environment Variables**: Check if the `$DISPLAY` environment variable is set correctly. It should point to the display server you intend to use.

By addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the issue and run the Tkinter application successfully. If you are working in a headless environment and cannot use a GUI, you might need to consider alternative ways to test the application, such as using a different interface or running it on a local machine with a display."

Local Machine: If you are running the code on your local machine and still encountering this error, make sure that your graphical environment is properly set up and that you have the necessary permissions to access the display.\n\n3. Remote Access: If you are accessing a remote machine via SSH, ensure that you have enabled X11 forwarding by using the -X or -Y option with the SSH command. This allows GUI applications to be displayed on your local machine.\n\n4. Environment Variables: Check if the $DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly. It should point to the display server you intend to use.\n\nBy addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the issue and run the Tkinter application successfully. If you are working in a headless environment and cannot use a GUI, you might need to consider alternative ways to test the application, such as using a different interface or running it on a local machine with a display.'} |

The error message you encountered is related to the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python. The specific error, `_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable`, indicates that the program is trying to create a GUI window but cannot find a display to render it on. This typically happens when you try to run a Tkinter application on a system without a graphical environment, such as a remote server or a headless machine.

Here are the key points to address this issue:

1. **Environment Issue**: The error suggests that the environment where you are running the script does not have access to a graphical display. This is common when running scripts on a server or through a remote terminal without GUI support.

2. **Solution Options**:
   - **Run Locally**: If possible, run the script on a local machine with a graphical interface where Tkinter can open a window.
   - **Use a Virtual Display**: If you need to run the script on a server, consider using a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to simulate a display environment.
   - **Remote Desktop**: Use a remote desktop solution that supports GUI applications, such as VNC or RDP, to access the server with a graphical interface.

3. **Testing Environment**: Ensure that your testing environment supports GUI applications. If you are using a virtual environment or container, make sure it is configured to support GUI operations.

By addressing the environment issue, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the display error.

Error Summary of Test Reports:
"The error message you encountered is related to the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python. The specific error, `_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable`, indicates that the program is trying to create a GUI window but cannot find a display to render it on. This typically happens when you try to run a Tkinter application on a system without a graphical environment, such as a remote server or a headless machine.

Here are the key points to address this issue:

1. **Environment Issue**: The error suggests that the environment where you are running the script does not have access to a graphical display. This is common when running scripts on a server or through a remote terminal without GUI support.

2. **Solution Options**:
   - **Run Locally**: If possible, run the script on a local machine with a graphical interface where Tkinter can open a window.
   - **Use a Virtual Display**: If you need to run the script on a server, consider using a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to simulate a display environment.
   - **Remote Desktop**: Use a remote desktop solution that supports GUI applications, such as VNC or RDP, to access the server with a graphical interface.

3. **Testing Environment**: Ensure that your testing environment supports GUI applications. If you are using a virtual environment or container, make sure it is configured to support GUI operations.

By addressing the environment issue, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the display error."

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Based on the provided code, the primary dependency for this project is the `tkinter` library, which is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI). However, `tkinter` is included with standard Python installations, so it doesn't need to be listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Since there are no other external libraries used in the code, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty. However, if you plan to expand the project in the future with additional libraries, you can add them to this file.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project as of now.
```

If you decide to add any additional libraries in the future, you can update this file accordingly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, the primary dependency for this project is the `tkinter` library, which is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI). However, `tkinter` is included with standard Python installations, so it doesn't need to be listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Since there are no other external libraries used in the code, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty. However, if you plan to expand the project in the future with additional libraries, you can add them to this file.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project as of now.
```
If you decide to add any additional libraries in the future, you can update this file accordingly. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Typing Practice Game

Welcome to the Typing Practice Game! This application is designed to help users improve their typing speed and accuracy through engaging practice sessions. The game displays random words or phrases that the user must type within a set time limit. At the end of the session, the game calculates and displays the user's words-per-minute (WPM) and accuracy percentage.

## Main Features

- **Random Word Display**: The game displays random words or phrases for the user to type.
- **Typing Speed Measurement**: Calculates the user's typing speed in words-per-minute (WPM).
- **Accuracy Calculation**: Measures the accuracy of the user's typing as a percentage.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive GUI built using Tkinter.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Tkinter library (usually included with Python standard library).

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the project repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: This project does not require any external dependencies beyond Python and Tkinter. Ensure your Python environment is set up correctly.

   ```bash
   # No additional installation needed
   ```

3. **Prepare Word List**: Ensure the `words.txt` file is in the same directory as the Python scripts. This file contains the words or phrases used in the game.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the `main.py` script to launch the game.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Game Interface**: A window will open displaying a word or phrase. Type the word in the input field and press Enter.

3. **Typing Session**: Continue typing the displayed words until the time runs out (default is 60 seconds).

4. **View Results**: After the session ends, your WPM and accuracy percentage will be displayed.

5. **Repeat**: You can close the window and restart the game to try again and improve your scores.

## Troubleshooting

- **GUI Issues**: If the GUI does not start, ensure you have a display environment available and that Tkinter is properly installed.
- **Word List**: If the game does not display words, check that `words.txt` is in the correct directory and contains valid entries.
