Given the task at hand, which is to write a piece of software code to solve a specific problem, I believe the most appropriate product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task involves implementing a functional piece of code, which aligns with the development of a software tool or application. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, we need to implement the `common` function in Python, which finds and returns the sorted unique common elements from two lists. The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus solely on the functionality of the `common` function.

### Core Function

- **Function: `common(l1, l2)`**
  - **Purpose**: To find and return a sorted list of unique common elements from two input lists `l1` and `l2`.

Now, let's implement the code for the `common` function in the `main.py` file.

#### main.py

```python
'''

Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.

'''

def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """
    Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.
    >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
    [1, 5, 653]
    >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
    [2, 3]
    """
    # Convert lists to sets to find common elements
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)
    
    # Find intersection of both sets
    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)
    
    # Convert to a sorted list
    return sorted(common_elements)
```

This code defines the `common` function, which takes two lists as input, converts them to sets to find the intersection (common elements), and then returns the sorted list of these unique common elements. This implementation is efficient and meets the requirements specified in the task description.

    [1, 5, 653]
    >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
    [2, 3]
    """
    # Convert lists to sets to find common elements
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)
    
    # Find intersection of both sets
    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)
    
    # Convert to a sorted list
    return sorted(common_elements)
```

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `common` only uses built-in Python data structures and functions. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed for this project.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```

As the Programmer correctly identified, the code provided in `main.py` does not require any external libraries or packages beyond Python's standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, indicating that no additional dependencies are necessary for the project to function correctly.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha
