We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To solve the given task, we need to implement a function `do_algebra` that takes two lists: `operator` and `operand`. The function will construct an algebraic expression using these lists and evaluate it. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Function Name**: `do_algebra`
   - **Purpose**: To evaluate an algebraic expression formed by the given operators and operands.

2. **Parameters**:
   - `operator`: A list of strings representing algebraic operations.
   - `operand`: A list of integers that will be used in the expression.

3. **Logic**:
   - Start with the first operand as the initial result.
   - Iterate through the operators and operands, applying each operator to the current result and the next operand.
   - Return the final result after all operations have been applied.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file:

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the provided code, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The function `do_algebra` only utilizes basic Python operations and does not require any additional dependencies. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no specific packages needed beyond the standard Python library.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Algebraic Expression Evaluator

This software module provides a function to evaluate algebraic expressions formed by a list of operators and a list of operands. The function `do_algebra` takes two lists as input: one containing basic algebra operations and the other containing integers. It constructs and evaluates the algebraic expression based on these inputs.

## Main Function

### `do_algebra(operator, operand)`

- **Description**: Evaluates an algebraic expression formed by a list of operators and a list of operands.
- **Parameters**:
  - `operator`: A list of strings representing basic algebra operations. Supported operations include:
    - Addition (`+`)
    - Subtraction (`-`)
    - Multiplication (`*`)
    - Floor division (`//`)
    - Exponentiation (`**`)
  - `operand`: A list of non-negative integers. The length of this list is one more than the length of the operator list.
- **Returns**: The result of the evaluated algebraic expression as an integer.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  operator = ['+', '*', '-']
  operand = [2, 3, 4, 5]
  result = do_algebra(operator, operand)  # Output will be 9
  ```

## Installation

This project does not require any external dependencies. It is implemented using standard Python libraries. To use this module, ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.

3. **Run the Code**: You can test the function by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Modify and Test**: You can modify the `operator` and `operand` lists in the `main.py` file to test different algebraic expressions.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the `do_algebra` function in your own Python script:

```python
from main import do_algebra

# Define operators and operands
operators = ['+', '*', '-']
operands = [2, 3, 4, 5]

# Evaluate the expression
result = do_algebra(operators, operands)

# Print the result
print(f"The result of the expression is: {result}")
```

This will output:
```
The result of the expression is: 9
```

## Documentation

For more detailed documentation, please refer to the comments within the `main.py` file. The function is designed to handle basic algebraic operations and assumes valid input as per the specified constraints.
