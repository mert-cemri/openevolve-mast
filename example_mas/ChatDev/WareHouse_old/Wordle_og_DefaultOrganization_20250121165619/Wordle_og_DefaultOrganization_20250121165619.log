Correct guess for each letter is colored by green (correct letter in correct position), grey for invalid letter, or yellow for correct letter in wrong position. It should be playable from Linux Terminal, and does not require me to access a dedicated UX or GUI platform, i.e. print the results on terminal at each stage and let me play it there by entering inputs. If the player guesses the word within the allowed number of attempts, they win. If not, the solution is revealed.

Given the customer's requirement for a game that is playable from the Linux Terminal and does not require a dedicated UX or GUI platform, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application" implemented via Python. This allows us to create a text-based game that can run directly in the terminal, meeting the customer's specifications. What are your thoughts on this?

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Design a standard wordle game by providing a daily 5-letter English language word. The game should allow a player to take 6 turns to guess the word. Correct guess for each letter is colored by green (correct letter in correct position), grey for invalid letter, or yellow for correct letter in wrong position.

If the player guesses the word within the allowed number of attempts, they win. If not, the solution is revealed.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To create a terminal-based Wordle game in Python, we'll focus on the following core components:

1. **Game Class**: This will manage the game state, including the word to guess, the number of attempts, and the logic for checking guesses.
   - `__init__`: Initialize the game with a word and set up attempts.
   - `check_guess`: Compare the player's guess to the word and return feedback.
   - `play`: Main loop to handle user input and game progression.

2. **Utility Functions**: These will handle tasks like selecting a random word from a list.
   - `get_random_word`: Select a random 5-letter word from a predefined list.

3. **Main Function**: This will start the game and handle user interaction.

Let's implement the code in a single file since it's a simple terminal-based application.

### main.py

```python
'''

This script implements a terminal-based Wordle game. The player has six attempts to guess a five-letter word. Feedback is provided for each guess: green for correct letters in the correct position, yellow for correct letters in the wrong position, and grey for incorrect letters.

'''

import random

class WordleGame:
    def __init__(self, word):
        '''
        Initialize the game with a word to guess and set up the number of attempts.

    def check_guess(self, guess):

        '''
        feedback = ['grey'] * 5
        word_list = list(self.word)
        guess_list = list(guess)

        # First pass: check for correct letters in the correct position
        for i in range(5):
            if guess_list[i] == word_list[i]:
                feedback[i] = 'green'
                word_list[i] = None  # Remove matched letter

        # Second pass: check for correct letters in the wrong position
        for i in range(5):
            if feedback[i] == 'grey' and guess_list[i] in word_list:
                feedback[i] = 'yellow'
                word_list[word_list.index(guess_list[i])] = None  # Remove matched letter

        '''
        print("Welcome to Wordle!")
        print("You have 6 attempts to guess the 5-letter word.")

        for attempt in range(self.attempts):
            guess = input(f"Attempt {attempt + 1}: ").strip().lower()

            if len(guess) != 5:
                print("Please enter a 5-letter word.")
                continue

            feedback = self.check_guess(guess)
            print("Feedback:", feedback)

            if feedback == ['green'] * 5:
                print("Congratulations! You've guessed the word!")
                return

        print(f"Sorry, you've used all attempts. The word was: {self.word}")

def get_random_word():
    '''
    Select a random 5-letter word from a predefined list.
    '''
    words = ["apple", "grape", "peach", "berry", "melon"]
    return random.choice(words)

def main():
    '''
    Start the game and handle user interaction.
    '''
    word = get_random_word()
    game = WordleGame(word)
    game.play()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

- **WordleGame Class**: Manages the game logic, including checking guesses and providing feedback.
- **check_guess Method**: Compares the player's guess with the correct word and provides feedback using colors (represented as strings).
- **play Method**: Handles the main game loop, taking user input and providing feedback until the word is guessed or attempts run out.
- **get_random_word Function**: Selects a random word from a predefined list of 5-letter words.
- **main Function**: Initializes the game and starts the play loop.

This code should be saved in a file named `main.py` and can be executed in a Linux terminal to play the Wordle game.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a standard wordle game by providing a daily 5-letter English language word. The game should allow a player to take 6 turns to guess the word. Correct guess for each letter is colored by green (correct letter in correct position), grey for invalid letter, or yellow for correct letter in wrong position. It should be playable from Linux Terminal, and does not require me to access a dedicated UX or GUI platform, i.e. print the results on terminal at each stage and let me play it there by entering inputs. If the player guesses the word within the allowed number of attempts, they win. If not, the solution is revealed..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a standard wordle game by providing a daily 5-letter English language word. The game should allow a player to take 6 turns to guess the word. Correct guess for each letter is colored by green (correct letter in correct position), grey for invalid letter, or yellow for correct letter in wrong position. It should be playable from Linux Terminal, and does not require me to access a dedicated UX or GUI platform, i.e. print the results on terminal at each stage and let me play it there by entering inputs. If the player guesses the word within the allowed number of attempts, they win. If not, the solution is revealed..

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Design a standard wordle game by providing a daily 5-letter English language word. The game should allow a player to take 6 turns to guess the word. Correct guess for each letter is colored by green (correct letter in correct position), grey for invalid letter, or yellow for correct letter in wrong position. It should be playable from Linux Terminal, and does not require me to access a dedicated UX or GUI platform, i.e. print the results on terminal at each stage and let me play it there by entering inputs. If the player guesses the word within the allowed number of attempts, they win. If not, the solution is revealed..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code for the Wordle game, it appears that the script does not rely on any external Python packages or libraries beyond the standard library. Therefore, a `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no additional dependencies needed.

However, if you want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can create an empty file or include a comment indicating that no external packages are required:

```plaintext
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

This comment serves as documentation for anyone reviewing the project, indicating that the code relies solely on Python's standard library.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code for the Wordle game, it appears that the script does not rely on any external Python packages or libraries beyond the standard library. Therefore, a `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no additional dependencies needed.
However, if you want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can create an empty file or include a comment indicating that no external packages are required:
```plaintext

As the Programmer correctly identified, the provided Wordle game code does not require any external Python packages beyond the standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would indeed be empty. However, for the sake of clarity and documentation, you can create a `requirements.txt` file with a comment indicating that no external dependencies are needed. Here is how you can write it:

```plaintext

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

# Wordle Game User Manual

Welcome to the Wordle Game! This manual will guide you through the installation and usage of the Wordle game, a terminal-based application that challenges you to guess a five-letter word within six attempts.

## Overview

The Wordle Game is a simple yet engaging word puzzle game where players have six attempts to guess a randomly selected five-letter word. After each guess, feedback is provided to help the player refine their guesses:
- **Green**: Correct letter in the correct position.
- **Yellow**: Correct letter in the wrong position.
- **Grey**: Incorrect letter.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

To run the Wordle Game, you need to have Python installed on your Linux system. You can check if Python is installed by running:

```bash
python --version
```

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
```

### Downloading the Game

1. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the script:

```bash
chmod +x main.py
```

## How to Play

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

2. Run the game using Python:

```bash
python main.py
