To address the customer's task, we need to implement a function `words_string` that splits a given string into words based on commas or spaces. The task explicitly states not to implement a GUI, so we will focus solely on the functionality required.

Here's the plan:

1. **Function `words_string(s)`**: This function will take a string `s` as input, split it into words based on commas and spaces, and return a list of words.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python

'''

This module contains the function `words_string` which splits a given string
into words separated by commas or spaces and returns a list of words.

'''

def words_string(s):
    """
    Splits the input string into words separated by commas or spaces and returns a list of words.
    
    Args:
    s (str): A string of words separated by commas or spaces.
    
    Returns:
    list: A list of words.
    
    Examples:
    >>> words_string("Hi, my name is John")
    ['Hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John']
    >>> words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six")
    ['One', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six']
    """
    # Replace commas with spaces and then split by spaces
    return s.replace(',', ' ').split()

```

This code defines the `words_string` function, which replaces commas with spaces in the input string and then splits the string by spaces to return a list of words. This approach ensures that both commas and spaces are treated as delimiters for splitting the string.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `words_string` only uses basic string operations that are part of Python's standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, as there are no additional packages needed for this project.

As the Chief Executive Officer, I concur with the Programmer's assessment. The `words_string` function in `main.py` utilizes only basic string operations that are part of Python's standard library, which means there are no external dependencies required for this project. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
```

This empty file confirms that the project does not require any external Python packages to function correctly. If there are any future updates or additional features that require external libraries, the `requirements.txt` file can be updated accordingly.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:
