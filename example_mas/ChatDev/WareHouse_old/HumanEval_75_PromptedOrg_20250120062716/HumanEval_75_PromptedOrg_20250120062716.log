To solve the task, we need to implement a function `is_multiply_prime(a)` that checks if a given number `a` is the product of exactly three prime numbers. Since `a` is less than 100, we can use a simple approach to check for this condition.

Here's the plan:

1. **Function `is_prime(n)`:** A helper function to check if a number `n` is a prime number.

2. **Function `is_multiply_prime(a)`:** The main function that uses `is_prime` to determine if `a` can be expressed as the product of exactly three prime numbers.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python

'''

This module contains a function to check if a given number is the product of exactly three prime numbers.

'''

def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def is_multiply_prime(a):
    """Return True if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers and False otherwise."""
    primes = [i for i in range(2, 100) if is_prime(i)]
    
    # Check all combinations of three primes
    for i in range(len(primes)):
        for j in range(i, len(primes)):
            for k in range(j, len(primes)):
                if primes[i] * primes[j] * primes[k] == a:
                    return True
    return False

# Example usage
# print(is_multiply_prime(30))  # Should return True
```

This code defines two functions: `is_prime` to check if a number is prime, and `is_multiply_prime` to check if a number is the product of exactly three prime numbers. The `is_multiply_prime` function generates a list of prime numbers less than 100 and checks all possible combinations of three primes to see if their product equals `a`. If such a combination is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses built-in Python functions and libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any third-party libraries.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses built-in Python functions and libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any third-party libraries. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha
