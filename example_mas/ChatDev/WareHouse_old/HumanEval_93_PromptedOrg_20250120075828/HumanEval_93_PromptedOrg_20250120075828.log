To complete the task, we need to implement the `encode` function as specified. The function will swap the case of all letters in the input message and replace all vowels with the letter that appears two places ahead in the English alphabet. The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and their uppercase counterparts. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the function needs to do:

1. Swap the case of each letter in the message.
2. Replace each vowel with the letter that appears two places ahead in the alphabet.
3. Return the modified message.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python

'''

This module contains a function to encode a message by swapping the case of all letters and replacing vowels with the letter that appears two places ahead in the alphabet.

def encode(message):

    Args:

    """
    # Define a mapping for vowels to their replacements
    vowel_mapping = {
        'a': 'c', 'e': 'g', 'i': 'k', 'o': 'q', 'u': 'w',
        'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'W'
    }
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store the encoded characters
    encoded_message = []
    
    # Iterate over each character in the message
    for char in message:
        # Swap the case of the character
        swapped_char = char.swapcase()
        
        # Replace the vowel if it is in the mapping
        if swapped_char in vowel_mapping:
            encoded_message.append(vowel_mapping[swapped_char])
        else:
            encoded_message.append(swapped_char)
    
    # Join the list into a string and return
    return ''.join(encoded_message)

```

This code defines the `encode` function, which processes the input message according to the specified rules. It uses a dictionary to map each vowel to its replacement and iterates over the message to construct the encoded result.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code only uses built-in Python functionalities. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code only uses built-in Python functionalities. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that there are no additional packages needed for the project to run. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would indeed be empty or not needed. However, for the sake of completeness and standard practice in Python projects, you can include a `requirements.txt` file with a comment indicating no external dependencies are required.

# Message Encoder

This software provides a function to encode messages by swapping the case of all letters and replacing vowels with the letter that appears two places ahead in the English alphabet. It is a simple yet effective tool for transforming text in a unique way.

## Main Functionality

The primary function of this software is `encode(message)`, which performs the following operations on a given message:
- Swaps the case of all letters in the message.
- Replaces all vowels in the message with the letter that appears two places ahead of that vowel in the English alphabet.

### Examples

- `encode('test')` will return `'TGST'`
- `encode('This is a message')` will return `'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'`

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it easy to set up and use. Simply ensure that you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - If the code is hosted on a version control system like GitHub, clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.

3. **Run the Code:**
   - You can directly run the `main.py` file using Python to test the `encode` function.

## How to Use

1. **Open a Python Environment:**
   - You can use any Python environment such as IDLE, PyCharm, VSCode, or a simple command-line interface.

2. **Import the Function:**
   - Import the `encode` function from the `main.py` file.

   ```python
   from main import encode
   ```

3. **Call the Function:**
   - Pass a string message to the `encode` function to get the encoded message.

   ```python
   encoded_message = encode('Your message here')
   print(encoded_message)
   ```

# Message Encoder

This software provides a function to encode messages by swapping the case of all letters and replacing vowels with the letter that appears two places ahead in the English alphabet. It is a simple yet effective tool for transforming text in a unique way.

## Main Functionality

The primary function of this software is `encode(message)`, which performs the following operations on a given message:
- Swaps the case of all letters in the message.
- Replaces all vowels in the message with the letter that appears two places ahead of that vowel in the English alphabet.

### Examples

- `encode('test')` will return `'TGST'`
- `encode('This is a message')` will return `'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'`

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it easy to set up and use. Simply ensure that you have Python installed on your system.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - If the code is hosted on a version control system like GitHub, clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.

3. **Run the Code:**
   - You can directly run the `main.py` file using Python to test the `encode` function.

## How to Use

1. **Open a Python Environment:**
   - You can use any Python environment such as IDLE, PyCharm, VSCode, or a simple command-line interface.

2. **Import the Function:**
