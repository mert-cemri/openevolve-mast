To solve the task, we need to implement the function `is_happy(s)` that checks if a given string `s` is "happy" according to the specified conditions. The function should return `True` if every 3 consecutive letters in the string are distinct and the string's length is at least 3; otherwise, it should return `False`.

Here is the plan:

1. **Function: `is_happy(s)`**
   - **Purpose**: To determine if a string is "happy" by checking if every 3 consecutive characters are distinct and the string length is at least 3.
   - **Logic**:
     - If the length of the string is less than 3, return `False`.
     - Iterate through the string, checking each set of 3 consecutive characters.
     - If any set of 3 consecutive characters are not distinct, return `False`.
     - If all sets of 3 consecutive characters are distinct, return `True`.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python

'''

You are given a string s.
Your task is to check if the string is happy or not.
A string is happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct.
For example:
is_happy(a) => False
is_happy(aa) => False
is_happy(abcd) => True
is_happy(aabb) => False
is_happy(adb) => True
is_happy(xyy) => False

'''

def is_happy(s):
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    for i in range(len(s) - 2):
        if s[i] == s[i+1] or s[i] == s[i+2] or s[i+1] == s[i+2]:
            return False
    return True

```

This code defines the `is_happy` function, which checks the conditions specified and returns the appropriate boolean value based on whether the string is "happy" or not.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `is_happy` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that there are no additional packages needed for the project to run.

Here is a conversation between two roles: Programmer: ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages.

"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `is_happy` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```

This indicates that there are no additional packages needed for the project to run. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

The task has been completed correctly. The function `is_happy` in `main.py` does not require any external dependencies or third-party libraries, as it only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty. For completeness, you can include a comment indicating that no external dependencies are required:

```
# No external dependencies required

This ensures clarity for anyone reviewing the project setup. If there are no further questions or tasks, I will consider this conversation complete.

is_happy(a) => False
is_happy(aa) => False
is_happy(abcd) => True
is_happy(aabb) => False
is_happy(adb) => True
is_happy(xyy) => False
'''
def is_happy(s):
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    for i in range(len(s) - 2):
        if s[i] == s[i+1] or s[i] == s[i+2] or s[i+1] == s[i+2]:
            return False
    return True
```

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:
