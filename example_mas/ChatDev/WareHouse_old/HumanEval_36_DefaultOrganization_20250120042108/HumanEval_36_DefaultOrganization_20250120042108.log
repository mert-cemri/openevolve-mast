Given the task at hand, which involves writing and fixing a piece of software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a functional piece of code, which aligns with the creation of a software tool or application. What are your thoughts on this?

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To complete the task, we need to focus on the function `fizz_buzz` that counts the number of times the digit '7' appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13. The task does not require a GUI, so we will only implement the necessary logic in the `main.py` file.

Let's outline the core function:

1. **Function `fizz_buzz(n: int)`:** 
   - **Purpose:** To calculate how many times the digit '7' appears in numbers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13.
   - **Logic:** Iterate through numbers less than `n`, check divisibility by 11 or 13, and count occurrences of '7' in those numbers.

Now, let's implement the code in `main.py`.

FILENAME: main.py

```python
'''

Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

'''

def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            count += str(i).count('7')
    return count

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
    print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
    print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
```

This code defines the `fizz_buzz` function as required and includes example usage to demonstrate its functionality. The function iterates through numbers less than `n`, checks if they are divisible by 11 or 13, and counts the occurrences of the digit '7'.

Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code only uses standard Python libraries and functions. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any additional Python packages beyond the standard library.

# Fizz Buzz Digit Counter

This software provides a function to count the number of times the digit '7' appears in integers less than a given number `n`, where those integers are divisible by either 11 or 13.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is:

- `fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int`: This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the count of the digit '7' in integers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13.

### Example Usage

```python
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies. It is implemented purely in Python, and you can run it in any standard Python environment.

### Quick Start

1. **Ensure you have Python installed**: This software requires Python to run. You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Download the Code**: Save the provided `main.py` file to your local machine.

3. **Run the Code**: You can execute the code by running the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will execute the example usage and display the output.

## How to Use

1. **Import the Function**: If you want to use the `fizz_buzz` function in your own scripts, you can import it from the `main.py` file.

   ```python
   from main import fizz_buzz
   ```

2. **Call the Function**: Use the `fizz_buzz` function by passing an integer `n` as an argument to get the count of the digit '7' in the specified range.

   ```python
   result = fizz_buzz(100)
   print(result)  # This will print the count of '7's in numbers less than 100 divisible by 11 or 13.
   ```

## Documentation

For further details on how the function works, you can refer to the docstring provided in the code. The function is designed to be simple and efficient, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities to count occurrences of the digit '7'.

This software is ideal for educational purposes or as a utility in larger projects where such a specific counting functionality is required.
