To complete the task, we need to implement the `remove_vowels` function as specified in the task description. The function should remove vowels from a given string. Since the task specifically instructs not to implement a GUI and only to write the necessary code, we will focus solely on the function implementation.

Here's the plan:

1. **Function Name**: `remove_vowels`
   - **Purpose**: To remove all vowels (both uppercase and lowercase) from a given string.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - We will iterate over each character in the input string.
   - We will check if the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) in both lowercase and uppercase.
   - If it is not a vowel, we will add it to the result string.
   - Return the result string.

Now, let's write the code for the `main.py` file:

FILENAME: main.py

```python
'''

DOCSTRING

This module contains the implementation of the remove_vowels function which removes all vowels from a given string.

'''

def remove_vowels(text):
    """
    remove_vowels is a function that takes a string and returns a string without vowels.
    >>> remove_vowels('')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")

    >>> remove_vowels('abcdef')
    'bcdf'
    >>> remove_vowels('aaaaa')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels('aaBAA')
    'B'
    >>> remove_vowels('zbcd')
    'zbcd'
    """
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return ''.join(char for char in text if char not in vowels)
```

This code defines the `remove_vowels` function, which removes all vowels from the input string and returns the resulting string. The function is implemented using a generator expression that filters out any characters that are vowels. The provided docstring includes examples that demonstrate the expected behavior of the function.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the given task and code, there are no external dependencies or packages required to run the `remove_vowels` function. The function only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file can be left empty or omitted entirely. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not require any additional packages beyond the standard Python library.

As the Chief Executive Officer, I agree with the Programmer's assessment. The `remove_vowels` function is self-contained and does not require any external libraries or packages beyond the standard Python library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file can indeed be left empty or omitted. However, for the sake of completeness and to adhere to standard practices, we can include an empty `requirements.txt` file with a comment indicating that no external dependencies are required. Here is how it would look:

```

This ensures that anyone reviewing the project understands that the function operates solely with built-in Python capabilities.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

### Function Definition

```python
def remove_vowels(text):
    """
    remove_vowels is a function that takes a string and returns a string without vowels.
    >>> remove_vowels('')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")
    'bcdf\nghjklm'
    >>> remove_vowels('abcdef')
    'bcdf'
    >>> remove_vowels('aaaaa')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels('aaBAA')
    'B'
    >>> remove_vowels('zbcd')
    'zbcd'
    """
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return ''.join(char for char in text if char not in vowels)
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it easy to set up and use. You only need to have Python installed on your system.
