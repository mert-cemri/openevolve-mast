Given the requirements for a Sudoku puzzle solver/creator, the product needs to be interactive, allow user input, and provide real-time feedback. This suggests that an Application modality would be the most suitable, as it can implement a visualized game or tool using Python, which is well-suited for handling the logic and interactivity required for a Sudoku solver/creator. What are your thoughts?

I agree with your assessment. An Application modality would indeed be the most suitable choice for developing a Sudoku puzzle solver/creator. It allows for the necessary interactivity, user input, and real-time feedback, and Python is an excellent language for implementing the logic and interface of such a tool.

To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To develop a classic Sudoku puzzle solver/creator, we will need to implement several core components. Here is a breakdown of the necessary classes and functions:

1. **SudokuBoard**: A class to represent the Sudoku board.
   - `__init__`: Initializes the board with a 9x9 grid.
   - `is_valid_move`: Checks if a move is valid according to Sudoku rules.
   - `is_complete`: Checks if the board is completely and correctly filled.
   - `print_board`: Prints the current state of the board.

2. **SudokuSolver**: A class to solve the Sudoku puzzle using backtracking.
   - `solve`: Solves the Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.
   - `find_empty`: Finds an empty cell on the board.

3. **SudokuGame**: A class to manage the game flow.
   - `start_game`: Starts the game, allowing user input and interaction.
   - `input_value`: Allows the player to input values into the board.
   - `check_for_mistakes`: Checks the board for mistakes.

4. **main**: The main function to run the application.

Now, let's implement the code for each file.

### main.py

```python
'''

Main module to run the Sudoku application.

'''

from sudoku_board import SudokuBoard
from sudoku_solver import SudokuSolver
from sudoku_game import SudokuGame

def main():
    board = SudokuBoard()
    solver = SudokuSolver(board)
    game = SudokuGame(board, solver)
    game.start_game()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### sudoku_board.py

            except ValueError:

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of ChatDev. Your primary responsibilities include overseeing all technical aspects of the company. You establish the company's technical vision and lead technological development, ensuring that technology resources align with the company's business needs.
You report to the CEO and collaborate with other executives to integrate technology into the company's strategy.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a classic Sudoku puzzle solver/creator that uses a 9x9 grid. Each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain the digits 1 through 9 exactly once. The program should allow the player to input values for specific cells, check for mistakes, and confirm when the puzzle is completed..
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To complete the implementation, we need to create the missing file and ensure all methods are implemented. The missing file is likely intended to handle additional functionality, such as generating a new Sudoku puzzle. Let's implement this functionality in a new file named `sudoku_creator.py`.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a classic Sudoku puzzle solver/creator that uses a 9x9 grid. Each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain the digits 1 through 9 exactly once. The program should allow the player to input values for specific cells, check for mistakes, and confirm when the puzzle is completed..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with user interaction in the `SudokuGame` class. The `input_value` method uses `input()` to get user input, which may not be suitable for all environments, especially if this is intended to be a GUI application or if the application is run in an environment where `input()` is not feasible (e.g., automated testing or certain IDEs).

To address this, consider abstracting the input mechanism to allow for different input methods (e.g., command-line, GUI, or automated tests). This can be done by creating an interface or a separate method that can be overridden or replaced depending on the environment.

### Suggested Revision:
1. Create an interface or a separate method for input handling.
2. Allow the `SudokuGame` class to accept an input handler as a parameter, which can be a function or a class responsible for getting user input.

```python
class SudokuGame:
    def __init__(self, board, solver, input_handler=None):
        self.board = board
        self.solver = solver
        self.input_handler = input_handler or self.default_input_handler

    def start_game(self):
        print("Welcome to Sudoku!")
        while not self.board.is_complete():
            self.board.print_board()
            row, col, num = self.input_handler()
            if self.board.is_valid_move(row, col, num):
                self.board.grid[row][col] = num
            else:
                print("Invalid move. Try again.")
        print("Congratulations! You have completed the Sudoku puzzle.")

    def default_input_handler(self):
        while True:
            try:
                row = int(input("Enter row (0-8): "))
                col = int(input("Enter column (0-8): "))
                num = int(input("Enter number (1-9): "))
                if 0 <= row < 9 and 0 <= col < 9 and 1 <= num <= 9:
                    return row, col, num
            except ValueError:
                pass
            print("Invalid input. Please enter numbers within the specified range.")
```

This change allows for greater flexibility and adaptability of the application across different environments.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a potential issue with user interaction in the `SudokuGame` class. The `input_value` method uses `input()` to get user input, which may not be suitable for all environments, especially if this is intended to be a GUI application or if the application is run in an environment where `input()` is not feasible (e.g., automated testing or certain IDEs).

To address this, consider abstracting the input mechanism to allow for different input methods (e.g., command-line, GUI, or automated tests). This can be done by creating an interface or a separate method that can be overridden or replaced depending on the environment.

### Suggested Revision:
1. Create an interface or a separate method for input handling.
2. Allow the `SudokuGame` class to accept an input handler as a parameter, which can be a function or a class responsible for getting user input.

```python
class SudokuGame:
    def __init__(self, board, solver, input_handler=None):
        self.board = board
        self.solver = solver
        self.input_handler = input_handler or self.default_input_handler

    def start_game(self):
        print("Welcome to Sudoku!")
        while not self.board.is_complete():
            self.board.print_board()
            row, col, num = self.input_handler()
            if self.board.is_valid_move(row, col, num):
                self.board.grid[row][col] = num
            else:
                print("Invalid move. Try again.")
        print("Congratulations! You have completed the Sudoku puzzle.")

    def default_input_handler(self):
        while True:
            try:
                row = int(input("Enter row (0-8): "))
                col = int(input("Enter column (0-8): "))
                num = int(input("Enter number (1-9): "))
                if 0 <= row < 9 and 0 <= col < 9 and 1 <= num <= 9:
                    return row, col, num
            except ValueError:
                pass
            print("Invalid input. Please enter numbers within the specified range.")
```

This change allows for greater flexibility and adaptability of the application across different environments."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

However, there is a potential issue with user interaction in the SudokuGame class. The input_value method uses input() to get user input, which may not be suitable for all environments, especially if this is intended to be a GUI application or if the application is run in an environment where input() is not feasible (e.g., automated testing or certain IDEs).\n\nTo address this, consider abstracting the input mechanism to allow for different input methods (e.g., command-line, GUI, or automated tests). This can be done by creating an interface or a separate method that can be overridden or replaced depending on the environment.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Create an interface or a separate method for input handling.\n2.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a classic Sudoku puzzle solver/creator that uses a 9x9 grid. Each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain the digits 1 through 9 exactly once. The program should allow the player to input values for specific cells, check for mistakes, and confirm when the puzzle is completed..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the task requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the `SudokuGame` class's `start_game` method. The method currently allows the player to input values for specific cells, but it does not provide a mechanism to check for mistakes during the game. The `check_for_mistakes` method is defined but not utilized within the game loop. This could lead to a situation where the player completes the puzzle with mistakes, and the game incorrectly congratulates them.

To fix this, I suggest integrating the `check_for_mistakes` method into the game loop to provide feedback to the player about any mistakes made during the game. Here's how you can modify the `start_game` method:

```python
def start_game(self):
    print("Welcome to Sudoku!")
    while not self.board.is_complete():
        self.board.print_board()
        mistakes = self.check_for_mistakes()
        if mistakes:
            print("Mistakes found at positions:", mistakes)
        row, col, num = self.input_handler()
        if self.board.is_valid_move(row, col, num):
            self.board.grid[row][col] = num
        else:
            print("Invalid move. Try again.")
    if not self.check_for_mistakes():
        print("Congratulations! You have completed the Sudoku puzzle.")
    else:
        print("Puzzle completed, but there are mistakes.")
```

This change will ensure that the player is informed of any mistakes during the game and upon completion, aligning the software with the user's requirements.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the task requirements. However, there is a potential issue with the `SudokuGame` class's `start_game` method. The method currently allows the player to input values for specific cells, but it does not provide a mechanism to check for mistakes during the game. The `check_for_mistakes` method is defined but not utilized within the game loop. This could lead to a situation where the player completes the puzzle with mistakes, and the game incorrectly congratulates them.

To fix this, I suggest integrating the `check_for_mistakes` method into the game loop to provide feedback to the player about any mistakes made during the game. Here's how you can modify the `start_game` method:

```python
def start_game(self):
    print("Welcome to Sudoku!")
    while not self.board.is_complete():
        self.board.print_board()
        mistakes = self.check_for_mistakes()
        if mistakes:
            print("Mistakes found at positions:", mistakes)
        row, col, num = self.input_handler()
        if self.board.is_valid_move(row, col, num):
            self.board.grid[row][col] = num
        else:
            print("Invalid move. Try again.")
    if not self.check_for_mistakes():
        print("Congratulations! You have completed the Sudoku puzzle.")
    else:
        print("Puzzle completed, but there are mistakes.")
```

This change will ensure that the player is informed of any mistakes during the game and upon completion, aligning the software with the user's requirements."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

However, there is a potential issue with the SudokuGame class\'s start_game method. The method currently allows the player to input values for specific cells, but it does not provide a mechanism to check for mistakes during the game. The check_for_mistakes method is defined but not utilized within the game loop. This could lead to a situation where the player completes the puzzle with mistakes, and the game incorrectly congratulates them.\n\nTo fix this, I suggest integrating the check_for_mistakes method into the game loop to provide feedback to the player about any mistakes made during the game. Here\'s how you can modify the start_game method:\n\npython\ndef start_game(self):\n    print("Welcome to Sudoku!")\n    while not self.board.is_complete():\n        self.board.print_board()\n        mistakes = self.check_for_mistakes()\n        if mistakes:\n            print("Mistakes found at positions:", mistakes)\n        row, col, num = self.input_handler()\n        if self.board.is_valid_move(row, col, num):\n            self.board.grid[row][col] = num\n        else:\n            print("Invalid move. Try again.")\n    if not self.check_for_mistakes():\n        print("Congratulations! You have completed the Sudoku puzzle.")\n    else:\n        print("Puzzle completed, but there are mistakes.")\n\n\nThis change will ensure that the player is informed of any mistakes during the game and upon completion, aligning the software with the user\'s requirements.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a classic Sudoku puzzle solver/creator that uses a 9x9 grid. Each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain the digits 1 through 9 exactly once. The program should allow the player to input values for specific cells, check for mistakes, and confirm when the puzzle is completed..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The code is mostly well-structured, but there is a significant issue with the `SudokuGame` class in `sudoku_game.py`. The `check_for_mistakes` method temporarily sets a cell to 0 to check if the move is valid, which can lead to incorrect behavior if the board is being modified concurrently or if the method is called multiple times in quick succession. This approach can also be inefficient as it checks the entire board every time. 

**Suggestion for Revision:**
Instead of modifying the board temporarily, maintain a separate data structure to track the current state of the board and validate moves against it. This will prevent any unintended side effects from altering the board during validation checks. Additionally, optimize the `check_for_mistakes` method to only check the affected row, column, and 3x3 subgrid for mistakes, rather than the entire board.

```python
def check_for_mistakes(self):
    mistakes = []
    for i in range(9):
        for j in range(9):
            num = self.board.grid[i][j]
            if num != 0:
                if not self.board.is_valid_move(i, j, num):
                    mistakes.append((i, j, num))
    return mistakes
```

This change will ensure that the board's state remains consistent and that the method performs efficiently.

This approach can also be inefficient as it checks the entire board every time. \n\nSuggestion for Revision:\nInstead of modifying the board temporarily, maintain a separate data structure to track the current state of the board and validate moves against it. This will prevent any unintended side effects from altering the board during validation checks. Additionally, optimize the check_for_mistakes method to only check the affected row, column, and 3x3 subgrid for mistakes, rather than the entire board.\n\npython\ndef check_for_mistakes(self):\n    mistakes = []\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(9):\n            num = self.board.grid[i][j]\n            if num != 0:\n                if not self.board.is_valid_move(i, j, num):\n                    mistakes.append((i, j, num))\n    return mistakes\n\n\nThis change will ensure that the board's state remains consistent and that the method performs efficiently."} |

Comments on Codes:
"The code is mostly well-structured, but there is a significant issue with the `SudokuGame` class in `sudoku_game.py`. The `check_for_mistakes` method temporarily sets a cell to 0 to check if the move is valid, which can lead to incorrect behavior if the board is being modified concurrently or if the method is called multiple times in quick succession. This approach can also be inefficient as it checks the entire board every time. 

**Suggestion for Revision:**
Instead of modifying the board temporarily, maintain a separate data structure to track the current state of the board and validate moves against it. This will prevent any unintended side effects from altering the board during validation checks. Additionally, optimize the `check_for_mistakes` method to only check the affected row, column, and 3x3 subgrid for mistakes, rather than the entire board.

```python
def check_for_mistakes(self):
    mistakes = []
    for i in range(9):
        for j in range(9):
            num = self.board.grid[i][j]
            if num != 0:
                if not self.board.is_valid_move(i, j, num):
                    mistakes.append((i, j, num))
    return mistakes
```

This change will ensure that the board's state remains consistent and that the method performs efficiently."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of ChatDev. Your primary responsibilities include overseeing all technical aspects of the company. You establish the company's technical vision and lead technological development, ensuring that technology resources align with the company's business needs.
You report to the CEO and collaborate with other executives to integrate technology into the company's strategy.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a classic Sudoku puzzle solver/creator that uses a 9x9 grid. Each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain the digits 1 through 9 exactly once. The program should allow the player to input values for specific cells, check for mistakes, and confirm when the puzzle is completed..
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

Based on the provided code, it appears that the project does not explicitly use any external Python libraries or packages that need to be installed via a package manager like `pip`. The code relies solely on Python's standard library, which does not require any additional dependencies to be listed in a `requirements.txt` file.

However, if you plan to extend the functionality in the future or if there are any hidden dependencies not mentioned in the code snippets, you would need to add those to the `requirements.txt` file. For now, since no external packages are used, the `requirements.txt` file can remain empty.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

If you decide to add any features that require external libraries, you can update this file accordingly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, it appears that the project does not explicitly use any external Python libraries or packages that need to be installed via a package manager like `pip`. The code relies solely on Python's standard library, which does not require any additional dependencies to be listed in a `requirements.txt` file.
However, if you plan to extend the functionality in the future or if there are any hidden dependencies not mentioned in the code snippets, you would need to add those to the `requirements.txt` file. For now, since no external packages are used, the `requirements.txt` file can remain empty.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```
If you decide to add any features that require external libraries, you can update this file accordingly. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are the Counselor at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to provide expert advice and guidance to the team, ensuring that the customer's needs are fully understood and met. You facilitate communication and offer valuable suggestions to improve the project's outcome.
You report to the executive team and collaborate with various departments to align the project with customer expectations.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a classic Sudoku puzzle solver/creator that uses a 9x9 grid. Each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain the digits 1 through 9 exactly once. The program should allow the player to input values for specific cells, check for mistakes, and confirm when the puzzle is completed..
To complete the task, you will analyze the customer's requirements and provide recommendations based on your expertise.]

As the CEO, I appreciate the thorough analysis provided by the Programmer. It seems that the current implementation of the Sudoku puzzle solver/creator does not require any external libraries beyond Python's standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file can indeed remain empty at this stage.

However, I would like to ensure that our solution is robust and scalable for future enhancements. Here are a few strategic considerations:

1. **Future Extensions**: If we plan to enhance the application with a graphical user interface (GUI) or integrate it with web services, we might need to include additional libraries such as `tkinter` for GUI or `flask` for web applications.

2. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Consider incorporating testing frameworks like `unittest` or `pytest` to ensure the reliability of the code. Although these are part of the standard library or easily installable, documenting them in `requirements.txt` could be beneficial for clarity.

3. **Documentation and Maintenance**: Encourage the team to maintain comprehensive documentation for any future developers who might work on this project. This includes updating the `requirements.txt` file whenever new dependencies are introduced.

4. **Version Control**: Ensure that the project is under version control using a system like Git, which will help in tracking changes and collaborating effectively.

With these considerations in mind, let's proceed with the current implementation. If any new features or dependencies are introduced, the `requirements.txt` file should be updated accordingly. If there are no further questions or issues, we can conclude this discussion.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)
