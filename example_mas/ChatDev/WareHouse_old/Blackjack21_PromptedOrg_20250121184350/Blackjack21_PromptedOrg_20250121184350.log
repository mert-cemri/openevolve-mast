Given the nature of the task, which is to build a Blackjack card game, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application." This would allow us to create an interactive and visualized game experience for users, implementing the standard rules and functionalities required for Blackjack. What are your thoughts on this?

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To build a Blackjack card game in Python, we will need to create several classes and functions to handle the game logic, card management, and player interactions. Here's a breakdown of the core components:

1. **Card Class**: Represents a single card in the deck.
   - `__init__`: Initializes a card with a suit and rank.
   - `value`: Returns the value of the card.

2. **Deck Class**: Manages a collection of cards.
   - `__init__`: Initializes a deck of 52 cards.
   - `shuffle`: Shuffles the deck.
   - `deal_card`: Deals a card from the deck.

3. **Hand Class**: Represents a player's or dealer's hand.
   - `__init__`: Initializes an empty hand.
   - `add_card`: Adds a card to the hand.
   - `calculate_value`: Calculates the total value of the hand.
   - `is_bust`: Checks if the hand value exceeds 21.

4. **BlackjackGame Class**: Manages the game logic.
   - `__init__`: Initializes the game with a deck and hands for the player and dealer.
   - `player_turn`: Handles the player's actions (hit, stand, double down).
   - `dealer_turn`: Handles the dealer's actions.
   - `determine_winner`: Determines the winner of the round.
   - `play_round`: Plays a round of Blackjack.

5. **Main Function**: Starts the game and manages user interaction.

Now, let's implement the code for each file.

### main.py

```python
'''

Main module to start the Blackjack game.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.
Here is a new customer's task: Build a Blackjack (21) card game supporting standard rules: the dealer hits up to 16 and stands on 17 or above. The user can choose to 'hit,' 'stand,' or 'double down' when appropriate. Track totals, detect busts, and determine the winner after each round..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the task requirements. However, there is a significant issue with the handling of the "double down" action. In Blackjack, "double down" typically involves doubling the player's bet, receiving exactly one more card, and then standing. The current implementation allows the player to continue playing after doubling down, which is incorrect.

**Comment with Highest Priority:**
The "double down" action should be revised to ensure that the player receives exactly one more card and then stands immediately, without the option to continue playing.

**Suggestions on Revision:**
1. Modify the `player_turn` method in `blackjack_game.py` to handle the "double down" action correctly:
   - After the player chooses to "double down," deal one card to the player's hand.
   - Immediately end the player's turn after dealing the card, regardless of whether the player busts or not.

Here's how you can adjust the code:

```python
def player_turn(self):
    while True:
        action = input("Choose action: 'hit', 'stand', 'double down': ").lower()
        if action == 'hit':
            self.player_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
            print(f"Player's hand value: {self.player_hand.calculate_value()}")
            if self.player_hand.is_bust():
                print("Player busts!")
                return False
        elif action == 'stand':
            return True
        elif action == 'double down':
            self.player_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
            print(f"Player's hand value: {self.player_hand.calculate_value()}")
            # End the turn immediately after doubling down
            return not self.player_hand.is_bust()
        else:
            print("Invalid action. Please choose 'hit', 'stand', or 'double down'.")
```

This change ensures that the game logic aligns with standard Blackjack rules regarding the "double down" action.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the task requirements. However, there is a significant issue with the handling of the "double down" action. In Blackjack, "double down" typically involves doubling the player's bet, receiving exactly one more card, and then standing. The current implementation allows the player to continue playing after doubling down, which is incorrect.

**Comment with Highest Priority:**
The "double down" action should be revised to ensure that the player receives exactly one more card and then stands immediately, without the option to continue playing.

**Suggestions on Revision:**
1. Modify the `player_turn` method in `blackjack_game.py` to handle the "double down" action correctly:
   - After the player chooses to "double down," deal one card to the player's hand.
   - Immediately end the player's turn after dealing the card, regardless of whether the player busts or not.

Here's how you can adjust the code:

```python
def player_turn(self):
    while True:
        action = input("Choose action: 'hit', 'stand', 'double down': ").lower()
        if action == 'hit':
            self.player_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
            print(f"Player's hand value: {self.player_hand.calculate_value()}")
            if self.player_hand.is_bust():
                print("Player busts!")
                return False
        elif action == 'stand':
            return True
        elif action == 'double down':
            self.player_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
            print(f"Player's hand value: {self.player_hand.calculate_value()}")
            # End the turn immediately after doubling down
            return not self.player_hand.is_bust()
        else:
            print("Invalid action. Please choose 'hit', 'stand', or 'double down'.")
```

This change ensures that the game logic aligns with standard Blackjack rules regarding the "double down" action."

Modify the player_turn method in blackjack_game.py to handle the "double down" action correctly:\n   - After the player chooses to "double down," deal one card to the player\'s hand.\n   - Immediately end the player\'s turn after dealing the card, regardless of whether the player busts or not.\n\nHere\'s how you can adjust the code:\n\npython\ndef player_turn(self):\n    while True:\n        action = input("Choose action: \'hit\', \'stand\', \'double down\': ").lower()\n        if action == \'hit\':\n            self.player_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())\n            print(f"Player\'s hand value: {self.player_hand.calculate_value()}")\n            if self.player_hand.is_bust():\n                print("Player busts!")\n                return False\n        elif action == \'stand\':\n            return True\n        elif action == \'double down\':\n            self.player_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())\n            print(f"Player\'s hand value: {self.player_hand.calculate_value()}")\n            # End the turn immediately after doubling down\n            return not self.player_hand.is_bust()\n        else:\n            print("Invalid action.

Here is a new customer's task: Build a Blackjack (21) card game supporting standard rules: the dealer hits up to 16 and stands on 17 or above. The user can choose to 'hit,' 'stand,' or 'double down' when appropriate. Track totals, detect busts, and determine the winner after each round..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the task requirements. However, there is a significant issue regarding the handling of the "double down" action. In Blackjack, when a player chooses to "double down," they typically double their bet, receive exactly one more card, and then their turn ends. The current implementation does not account for the betting aspect, which is a crucial part of the "double down" action.

### Comment with Highest Priority:
The "double down" action in the `player_turn` method does not handle the betting aspect, which is a critical part of the Blackjack rules. The player should double their bet when choosing to "double down."

### Suggestions on Revision:
1. **Add a Betting System**: Introduce a simple betting system to handle the player's bet. You can add an attribute to track the player's current bet and double it when the player chooses to "double down."

2. **Modify the `player_turn` Method**: Update the `player_turn` method to reflect the doubling of the bet when the player chooses to "double down."

3. **Update Game Initialization**: Initialize the player's bet at the start of each round and adjust the player's balance accordingly after the round ends based on the outcome.

Here's a basic outline of how you might implement these changes:

```python
# In BlackjackGame class
class BlackjackGame:
    def __init__(self):
        self.deck = Deck()
        self.player_hand = Hand()
        self.dealer_hand = Hand()
        self.player_balance = 1000  # Example starting balance
        self.current_bet = 0

    def place_bet(self, amount):
        if amount > self.player_balance:
            print("Insufficient balance to place this bet.")
            return False
        self.current_bet = amount
        self.player_balance -= amount
        return True

    def player_turn(self):
        while True:
            action = input("Choose action: 'hit', 'stand', 'double down': ").lower()
            if action == 'hit':
                self.player_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
                print(f"Player's hand value: {self.player_hand.calculate_value()}")
                if self.player_hand.is_bust():
                    print("Player busts!")
                    return False
            elif action == 'stand':
                return True
            elif action == 'double down':
                if self.place_bet(self.current_bet):  # Double the bet
                    self.player_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())

                    return not self.player_hand.is_bust()
                else:
                    print("Unable to double down due to insufficient balance.")
            else:
                print("Invalid action. Please choose 'hit', 'stand', or 'double down'.")

    def determine_winner(self):
        player_value = self.player_hand.calculate_value()
        dealer_value = self.dealer_hand.calculate_value()
        if player_value > 21:
            return "Dealer wins!"
        elif dealer_value > 21 or player_value > dealer_value:
            self.player_balance += self.current_bet * 2  # Player wins, double the bet
            return "Player wins!"
        elif player_value < dealer_value:
            return "Dealer wins!"
        else:
            self.player_balance += self.current_bet  # Tie, return the bet
            return "It's a tie!"

    def play_round(self):
        bet_amount = int(input("Enter your bet amount: "))
        if not self.place_bet(bet_amount):
            return
        self.player_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
        self.player_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
        self.dealer_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
        self.dealer_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
        print(f"Player's initial hand value: {self.player_hand.calculate_value()}")
        print(f"Dealer's visible card value: {self.dealer_hand.cards[0].value()}")
        if self.player_turn():

1. **Add a Betting System**: Introduce a simple betting system to handle the player's bet. You can add an attribute to track the player's current bet and double it when the player chooses to "double down."

2. **Modify the `player_turn` Method**: Update the `player_turn` method to reflect the doubling of the bet when the player chooses to "double down."

3. **Update Game Initialization**: Initialize the player's bet at the start of each round and adjust the player's balance accordingly after the round ends based on the outcome.

Here's a basic outline of how you might implement these changes:

```python
# In BlackjackGame class
class BlackjackGame:
    def __init__(self):
        self.deck = Deck()
        self.player_hand = Hand()
        self.dealer_hand = Hand()
        self.player_balance = 1000  # Example starting balance
        self.current_bet = 0

    def place_bet(self, amount):
        if amount > self.player_balance:
            print("Insufficient balance to place this bet.")
            return False
        self.current_bet = amount
        self.player_balance -= amount
        return True

    def player_turn(self):
        while True:
            action = input("Choose action: 'hit', 'stand', 'double down': ").lower()
            if action == 'hit':
                self.player_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
                print(f"Player's hand value: {self.player_hand.calculate_value()}")
                if self.player_hand.is_bust():
                    print("Player busts!")
                    return False
            elif action == 'stand':
                return True
            elif action == 'double down':
                if self.place_bet(self.current_bet):  # Double the bet
                    self.player_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
                    print(f"Player's hand value: {self.player_hand.calculate_value()}")
                    return not self.player_hand.is_bust()
                else:
                    print("Unable to double down due to insufficient balance.")
            else:
                print("Invalid action. Please choose 'hit', 'stand', or 'double down'.")

    def determine_winner(self):
        player_value = self.player_hand.calculate_value()
        dealer_value = self.dealer_hand.calculate_value()
        if player_value > 21:
            return "Dealer wins!"
        elif dealer_value > 21 or player_value > dealer_value:
            self.player_balance += self.current_bet * 2  # Player wins, double the bet
            return "Player wins!"
        elif player_value < dealer_value:
            return "Dealer wins!"
        else:
            self.player_balance += self.current_bet  # Tie, return the bet
            return "It's a tie!"

    def play_round(self):
        bet_amount = int(input("Enter your bet amount: "))
        if not self.place_bet(bet_amount):
            return
        self.player_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
        self.player_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
        self.dealer_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
        self.dealer_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
        print(f"Player's initial hand value: {self.player_hand.calculate_value()}")
        print(f"Dealer's visible card value: {self.dealer_hand.cards[0].value()}")
        if self.player_turn():
            self.dealer_turn()
            print(self.determine_winner())
        print(f"Player's balance: {self.player_balance}")
```

This revision introduces a simple betting system and ensures that the "double down" action is handled correctly according to Blackjack rules.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the task requirements. However, there is a significant issue regarding the handling of the "double down" action. In Blackjack, when a player chooses to "double down," they typically double their bet, receive exactly one more card, and then their turn ends. The current implementation does not account for the betting aspect, which is a crucial part of the "double down" action.

### Comment with Highest Priority:
The "double down" action in the `player_turn` method does not handle the betting aspect, which is a critical part of the Blackjack rules. The player should double their bet when choosing to "double down."

### Suggestions on Revision:
1. **Add a Betting System**: Introduce a simple betting system to handle the player's bet. You can add an attribute to track the player's current bet and double it when the player chooses to "double down."

2. **Modify the `player_turn` Method**: Update the `player_turn` method to reflect the doubling of the bet when the player chooses to "double down."

3. **Update Game Initialization**: Initialize the player's bet at the start of each round and adjust the player's balance accordingly after the round ends based on the outcome.

Here's a basic outline of how you might implement these changes:

```python
# In BlackjackGame class
class BlackjackGame:
    def __init__(self):
        self.deck = Deck()
        self.player_hand = Hand()
        self.dealer_hand = Hand()
        self.player_balance = 1000  # Example starting balance
        self.current_bet = 0

    def place_bet(self, amount):
        if amount > self.player_balance:
            print("Insufficient balance to place this bet.")
            return False
        self.current_bet = amount
        self.player_balance -= amount
        return True

    def player_turn(self):
        while True:
            action = input("Choose action: 'hit', 'stand', 'double down': ").lower()
            if action == 'hit':
                self.player_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
                print(f"Player's hand value: {self.player_hand.calculate_value()}")
                if self.player_hand.is_bust():
                    print("Player busts!")
                    return False
            elif action == 'stand':
                return True
            elif action == 'double down':
                if self.place_bet(self.current_bet):  # Double the bet
                    self.player_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
                    print(f"Player's hand value: {self.player_hand.calculate_value()}")
                    return not self.player_hand.is_bust()
                else:
                    print("Unable to double down due to insufficient balance.")
            else:
                print("Invalid action. Please choose 'hit', 'stand', or 'double down'.")

    def determine_winner(self):
        player_value = self.player_hand.calculate_value()
        dealer_value = self.dealer_hand.calculate_value()
        if player_value > 21:
            return "Dealer wins!"
        elif dealer_value > 21 or player_value > dealer_value:
            self.player_balance += self.current_bet * 2  # Player wins, double the bet
            return "Player wins!"
        elif player_value < dealer_value:
            return "Dealer wins!"
        else:
            self.player_balance += self.current_bet  # Tie, return the bet
            return "It's a tie!"

    def play_round(self):
        bet_amount = int(input("Enter your bet amount: "))
        if not self.place_bet(bet_amount):
            return
        self.player_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
        self.player_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
        self.dealer_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
        self.dealer_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
        print(f"Player's initial hand value: {self.player_hand.calculate_value()}")
        print(f"Dealer's visible card value: {self.dealer_hand.cards[0].value()}")
        if self.player_turn():
            self.dealer_turn()
            print(self.determine_winner())
        print(f"Player's balance: {self.player_balance}")
```

The current implementation does not account for the betting aspect, which is a crucial part of the "double down" action.\n\n### Comment with Highest Priority:\nThe "double down" action in the player_turn method does not handle the betting aspect, which is a critical part of the Blackjack rules. The player should double their bet when choosing to "double down."\n\n### Suggestions on Revision:\n1. Add a Betting System: Introduce a simple betting system to handle the player\'s bet.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.
Here is a new customer's task: Build a Blackjack (21) card game supporting standard rules: the dealer hits up to 16 and stands on 17 or above. The user can choose to 'hit,' 'stand,' or 'double down' when appropriate. Track totals, detect busts, and determine the winner after each round..
To complete the task, you will write code to implement the required functionality, ensuring it meets the customer's specifications and quality standards.]

The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a critical issue regarding the handling of the player's balance and bet amount during the "double down" action. The current implementation deducts the bet amount twice from the player's balance when doubling down, which is incorrect. The bet should only be doubled, not deducted again.

### Comment with Highest Priority:
- **Issue**: When the player chooses to "double down," the bet amount is deducted twice from the player's balance.
- **Suggestion**: Modify the `double down` logic in the `player_turn` method to ensure that the player's balance is only adjusted once. Specifically, when doubling down, the bet should be doubled, but the player's balance should not be reduced again since it was already deducted when the initial bet was placed.

### Suggested Revision:
```python
elif action == 'double down':
    if self.player_balance >= self.current_bet:  # Ensure sufficient balance for doubling
        self.current_bet *= 2  # Double the bet
        self.player_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
        print(f"Player's hand value: {self.player_hand.calculate_value()}")
        return not self.player_hand.is_bust()
    else:
        print("Unable to double down due to insufficient balance.")
```

This change ensures that the player's balance is correctly managed during a "double down" action, aligning with standard Blackjack rules.

Comments on Codes:
"The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there is a critical issue regarding the handling of the player's balance and bet amount during the "double down" action. The current implementation deducts the bet amount twice from the player's balance when doubling down, which is incorrect. The bet should only be doubled, not deducted again.

### Comment with Highest Priority:
- **Issue**: When the player chooses to "double down," the bet amount is deducted twice from the player's balance.
- **Suggestion**: Modify the `double down` logic in the `player_turn` method to ensure that the player's balance is only adjusted once. Specifically, when doubling down, the bet should be doubled, but the player's balance should not be reduced again since it was already deducted when the initial bet was placed.

### Suggested Revision:
```python
elif action == 'double down':
    if self.player_balance >= self.current_bet:  # Ensure sufficient balance for doubling
        self.current_bet *= 2  # Double the bet
        self.player_hand.add_card(self.deck.deal_card())
        print(f"Player's hand value: {self.player_hand.calculate_value()}")
        return not self.player_hand.is_bust()
    else:
        print("Unable to double down due to insufficient balance.")
```

This change ensures that the player's balance is correctly managed during a "double down" action, aligning with standard Blackjack rules."

Here is a new customer's task: Build a Blackjack (21) card game supporting standard rules: the dealer hits up to 16 and stands on 17 or above. The user can choose to 'hit,' 'stand,' or 'double down' when appropriate. Track totals, detect busts, and determine the winner after each round..
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

Based on the provided code, it seems that the project does not explicitly use any external libraries or packages that need to be specified in a `requirements.txt` file. The code primarily relies on Python's standard library, which does not require any additional installations.

However, if you plan to extend the project in the future or if there are any hidden dependencies not shown in the provided code, you can include them in the `requirements.txt` file. For now, the file can remain empty or include any future dependencies as needed.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project as per the current code.
```

If you decide to add any additional features or use external libraries later, you can update this file accordingly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, it seems that the project does not explicitly use any external libraries or packages that need to be specified in a `requirements.txt` file. The code primarily relies on Python's standard library, which does not require any additional installations.
However, if you plan to extend the project in the future or if there are any hidden dependencies not shown in the provided code, you can include them in the `requirements.txt` file. For now, the file can remain empty or include any future dependencies as needed.

You report to the executive team and collaborate with various departments to align the project with customer expectations.
Here is a new customer's task: Build a Blackjack (21) card game supporting standard rules: the dealer hits up to 16 and stands on 17 or above. The user can choose to 'hit,' 'stand,' or 'double down' when appropriate. Track totals, detect busts, and determine the winner after each round..
To complete the task, you will analyze the customer's requirements and provide recommendations based on your expertise.]

As the CEO, I appreciate the thorough analysis provided by the Programmer. Based on the current code, it appears that the project does not require any external libraries beyond Python's standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file can indeed remain empty for now.

However, I would like to ensure that our project is scalable and maintainable. Here are some strategic steps we should consider:

1. **Code Review and Testing**: Ensure that the code is reviewed for quality and thoroughly tested. This will help identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.

2. **Documentation**: While the code is well-commented, consider creating a user guide or documentation that explains how to set up and run the game. This will be beneficial for both users and future developers.

3. **Future Enhancements**: Think about potential features or enhancements that could be added to the game, such as a graphical user interface (GUI), multiplayer support, or additional betting options. This could increase the game's appeal and user engagement.

4. **Version Control**: Ensure that the project is under version control (e.g., using Git) to manage changes and collaborate effectively with other team members.

5. **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback loop with users to gather insights and suggestions for future improvements.

By following these steps, we can ensure that the Blackjack game not only meets the current requirements but is also positioned for future growth and enhancement. If there are any additional features or external libraries needed in the future, we can update the `requirements.txt` file accordingly. Let's proceed with these strategic initiatives to ensure the success of this project.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:
