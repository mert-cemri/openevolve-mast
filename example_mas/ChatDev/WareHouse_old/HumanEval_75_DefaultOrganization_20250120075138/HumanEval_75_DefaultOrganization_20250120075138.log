Given the nature of the task, which involves writing a function in Python to solve a specific problem, I believe the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to focus on the code implementation without any additional presentation or visualization requirements. What are your thoughts?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" is indeed the most appropriate modality for this task, as it focuses on the core functionality of writing and testing the Python code.

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `is_multiply_prime` that checks if a given number is the product of exactly three prime numbers. Since the number is less than 100, we can use a simple approach to check for prime factors.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the implementation:

1. **Prime Checking Function**: We need a helper function to determine if a number is prime.
2. **Prime Factorization**: We will iterate through numbers to check if they are prime and if they are factors of the given number.
3. **Count Prime Factors**: We will count the number of distinct prime factors and check if they multiply to the given number.

Let's implement this in the `main.py` file:

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to determine if a given number is the product of exactly three prime numbers.

'''

def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def is_multiply_prime(a):
    """Returns true if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers and false otherwise."""
    if a < 2:
        return False

    prime_factors = []
    for i in range(2, a):
        while is_prime(i) and a % i == 0:
            prime_factors.append(i)
            a //= i
        if len(prime_factors) > 3:
            return False

    return len(prime_factors) == 3

# Example usage:
# print(is_multiply_prime(30))  # Should return True
# print(is_multiply_prime(60))  # Should return False
```

This code defines a function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime and a function `is_multiply_prime` to determine if a number is the product of exactly three prime numbers. The `is_multiply_prime` function iterates over possible factors, checks if they are prime, and counts how many distinct prime factors are found. If exactly three prime factors are found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The code logic for checking if a number is the product of exactly three prime numbers is incorrect. The current implementation checks for prime factors but does not ensure that exactly three distinct prime numbers are used in the multiplication. For example, it would incorrectly return True for numbers like 8 (2 * 2 * 2), which is not a product of three distinct prime numbers.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the number is the product of exactly three distinct prime numbers. Here's the revised code:

```python
def is_prime(n):

    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):

        return False
    prime_factors = set()
    for i in range(2, a):
        while is_prime(i) and a % i == 0:

    return len(prime_factors) == 3

# Example usage:
# print(is_multiply_prime(30))  # Should return True
# print(is_multiply_prime(60))  # Should return False

This revision ensures that the function checks for exactly three distinct prime factors.

The code logic is mostly correct, but there is a critical issue: the function `is_multiply_prime` should ensure that the number is the product of exactly three distinct prime numbers. The current implementation checks for prime factors but does not ensure that the product is exactly three primes. It also does not handle the case where the same prime factor is used multiple times (e.g., 8 = 2 * 2 * 2).

**Suggestion for Revision:**
1. Modify the logic to ensure that the number is the product of exactly three distinct prime numbers.
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles cases where the same prime factor is repeated.

Here is the revised code:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):

            return False
    return True

def is_multiply_prime(a):

        return False

        if len(prime_factors) > 3:
            return False
    return len(prime_factors) == 3 and len(set(prime_factors)) == 3

# Example usage:

Comments on Codes:
"The code logic is mostly correct, but there is a critical issue: the function `is_multiply_prime` should ensure that the number is the product of exactly three distinct prime numbers. The current implementation checks for prime factors but does not ensure that the product is exactly three primes. It also does not handle the case where the same prime factor is used multiple times (e.g., 8 = 2 * 2 * 2).

**Suggestion for Revision:**
1. Modify the logic to ensure that the number is the product of exactly three distinct prime numbers.
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles cases where the same prime factor is repeated.

Here is the revised code:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def is_multiply_prime(a):
    """Returns true if the given number is the multiplication of 3 distinct prime numbers and false otherwise."""
    if a < 2:
        return False
    prime_factors = []
    for i in range(2, a):
        while is_prime(i) and a % i == 0:
            prime_factors.append(i)
            a //= i
        if len(prime_factors) > 3:
            return False
    return len(prime_factors) == 3 and len(set(prime_factors)) == 3

# Example usage:
# print(is_multiply_prime(30))  # Should return True
# print(is_multiply_prime(60))  # Should return False
```

This revision ensures that the function checks for exactly three distinct prime factors."

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code only uses built-in Python functions and libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, indicating that no additional packages are needed for the project to run properly.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**
