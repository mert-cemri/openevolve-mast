To solve the task, we need to implement the function `how_many_times` which counts how many times a given substring can be found in the original string, including overlapping cases. This function will be implemented in a single file, `main.py`.

### Core Function
- **how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int**: This function will take two parameters, `string` and `substring`, and return the number of times the `substring` appears in `string`, counting overlapping occurrences.

Now, let's implement the function in `main.py`.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to count the number of times a substring appears in a string, including overlapping occurrences.

'''

def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """ 
    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string. Count overlapping cases.
    
    >>> how_many_times('', 'a')
    0
    >>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
    3
    >>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
    3
    """
    count = start = 0
    while True:
        start = string.find(substring, start)
        if start == -1:
            break
        count += 1
        start += 1  # Move start one position forward to count overlapping
    return count
```

This implementation uses a loop to find each occurrence of the `substring` in the `string`, starting from the last found position plus one, to ensure overlapping cases are counted. The loop continues until no more occurrences are found (`find` returns `-1`).

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The function `how_many_times` only uses built-in Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for the sake of completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any external libraries beyond the Python standard library.

"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The function `how_many_times` only uses built-in Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for the sake of completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that the project does not rely on any external libraries beyond the Python standard library. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# How Many Times

A Python utility to count the number of times a given substring appears in a string, including overlapping occurrences.

## Overview

The `how_many_times` function is designed to find and count all occurrences of a specified substring within a given string, including cases where the occurrences overlap. This can be particularly useful in text analysis and processing tasks where precise substring counting is required.

## Main Function

### how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int

- **Description**: This function takes two arguments: a `string` and a `substring`. It returns an integer representing the number of times the `substring` is found within the `string`, counting overlapping occurrences.

- **Parameters**:
  - `string` (str): The original string in which to search for the substring.
  - `substring` (str): The substring to search for within the original string.

- **Returns**: An integer count of how many times the `substring` appears in the `string`, including overlapping cases.

- **Example Usage**:
  ```python
  >>> how_many_times('', 'a')
  0
  >>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
  3
  >>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
  3
  ```

## Installation

### Environment Setup

This utility does not require any external dependencies beyond standard Python libraries. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

1. **Clone the Repository**: If the code is hosted in a repository, clone it to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Ensure Python is Installed**: Verify that Python is installed by running:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Function**: You can directly use the function in your Python scripts by importing it from the `main.py` file.

   ```python
   from main import how_many_times

   # Example usage
   result = how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
   print(result)  # Output: 3
   ```

2. **Testing**: You can test the function using the provided examples or by writing additional test cases to ensure it meets your specific needs.

## Documentation and Support

For further assistance or to report issues, please contact our support team or visit our documentation page (if available).

```

This manual provides a comprehensive guide on how to use the `how_many_times` function, including installation instructions and example usage. It is designed to help users quickly understand and implement the function in their own projects.
