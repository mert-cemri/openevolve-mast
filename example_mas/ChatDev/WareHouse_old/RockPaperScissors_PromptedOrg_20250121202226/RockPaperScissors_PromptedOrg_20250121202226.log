Given the nature of the task, which is to create a Rock-Paper-Scissors game, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to implement a visualized game using Python, which aligns perfectly with the requirements of developing an interactive game where the user can choose an option and the computer can randomly pick one. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" is indeed the most suitable product modality for creating an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game. It allows us to leverage Python to implement the game logic and provide a visual interface for user interaction. This aligns well with the customer's requirements and our company's capabilities. Let's proceed with this modality.

Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of ChatDev. Your primary responsibilities include overseeing all technical aspects of the company. You establish the company's technical vision and lead technological development, ensuring that technology resources align with the company's business needs.
You report to the CEO and collaborate with other executives to integrate technology into the company's strategy.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The user chooses one option, and the computer randomly picks one. Compare results using the usual rules (Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock). Display the outcome and allow replay..
To complete the task, you will develop the technical strategy and guide your team to ensure the solution meets the customer's needs and adheres to technological standards.]

To create a Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python, we will structure the application into a single file for simplicity, as the task is relatively straightforward. Here's a breakdown of the core functions and their purposes:

1. **main()**: This function will serve as the entry point of the application. It will handle the game loop, allowing the user to play multiple rounds.

2. **get_user_choice()**: This function will prompt the user to input their choice of Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

3. **get_computer_choice()**: This function will randomly select a choice for the computer.

4. **determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)**: This function will compare the user's choice and the computer's choice to determine the winner according to the rules of the game.

5. **display_result(user_choice, computer_choice, winner)**: This function will display the result of the game round, showing both choices and the winner.

6. **play_again()**: This function will ask the user if they want to play another round and return a boolean value.

Now, let's implement the code in a single file named `rock_paper_scissors.py`.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Based on the provided code for the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, the only external library used is `random`, which is part of Python's standard library. Therefore, there are no additional dependencies required for this project. However, it's still a good practice to create a `requirements.txt` file for consistency and future scalability. Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

If you want to explicitly specify the Python version used for the project, you can include a comment like this:

```
# Python version 3.x.x
```

Replace `3.x.x` with the specific version of Python you are using, if needed.

As the CEO, I appreciate the work done by the Programmer and CTO in developing the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The code appears to be well-structured and meets the customer's requirements. Additionally, the Programmer has correctly identified that there are no external dependencies required for this project, as the `random` module is part of Python's standard library.

To ensure clarity and maintain best practices, I suggest the following steps:

1. **Finalize the Requirements File**: Although there are no external dependencies, it's good practice to include a `requirements.txt` file for future scalability. The Programmer has already provided a suitable template. Ensure it is included in the project repository.

2. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Before delivering the final product to the customer, ensure that the game is thoroughly tested for any potential bugs or issues. This includes testing different user inputs and ensuring the replay functionality works seamlessly.

3. **Documentation**: Provide a brief user guide or README file that explains how to run the game, including any prerequisites such as the Python version required.

4. **Feedback Loop**: Once the game is delivered, establish a feedback loop with the customer to gather any insights or additional requirements they might have. This will help us improve the product and customer satisfaction.

5. **Future Enhancements**: Consider potential enhancements for future iterations, such as adding a graphical user interface (GUI) or expanding the game with additional features.

By following these steps, we can ensure that the Rock-Paper-Scissors game not only meets the current requirements but also sets the stage for future improvements and customer satisfaction. If there are no further questions or tasks, we can proceed to finalize and deliver the project.

2. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Before delivering the final product to the customer, ensure that the game is thoroughly tested for any potential bugs or issues. This includes testing different user inputs and ensuring the replay functionality works seamlessly.

3. **Documentation**: Provide a brief user guide or README file that explains how to run the game, including any prerequisites such as the Python version required.

4. **Feedback Loop**: Once the game is delivered, establish a feedback loop with the customer to gather any insights or additional requirements they might have. This will help us improve the product and customer satisfaction.

5. **Future Enhancements**: Consider potential enhancements for future iterations, such as adding a graphical user interface (GUI) or expanding the game with additional features.

By following these steps, we can ensure that the Rock-Paper-Scissors game not only meets the current requirements but also sets the stage for future improvements and customer satisfaction. If there are no further questions or tasks, we can proceed to finalize and deliver the project.
