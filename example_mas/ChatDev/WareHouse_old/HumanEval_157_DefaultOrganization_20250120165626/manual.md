# Right Angle Triangle Checker

This software provides a simple function to determine if three given side lengths can form a right-angled triangle. It is implemented in Python and does not require any external dependencies.

## Main Function

The main function provided by this software is `right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)`. This function takes three arguments, which represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and returns a boolean value:

- `True` if the sides form a right-angled triangle.
- `False` otherwise.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example 1: Right-angled triangle
print(right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5))  # Output: True

# Example 2: Not a right-angled triangle
print(right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3))  # Output: False
```

## Installation

Since this software does not require any external libraries, you can use it directly with a standard Python installation. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the function.

2. **Run the Function**: Use a Python interpreter to run the `main.py` file or import the function into your own Python script.

3. **Test the Function**: You can test the function with different sets of side lengths to check if they form a right-angled triangle.

## No External Dependencies

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it lightweight and easy to integrate into other projects.

## Additional Information

This function works by sorting the side lengths and applying the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
