Given the nature of the task, which is to write and correct a piece of software code, the most appropriate product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task involves implementing a functional piece of software code, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts on this?

To solve the task, we need to implement the `correct_bracketing` function in Python. The function should check if every opening bracket "<" has a corresponding closing bracket ">". The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus solely on the logic for the function.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Name**: `correct_bracketing`
   - **Purpose**: To determine if a string of brackets is correctly bracketed, meaning every "<" has a corresponding ">".

2. **Logic**:
   - Use a counter to track the balance of brackets.
   - Iterate over each character in the string.
   - Increment the counter for each "<" and decrement for each ">".
   - If the counter goes negative at any point, return `False` (more ">" than "<").
   - At the end of the iteration, return `True` if the counter is zero (balanced), otherwise `False`.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

main.py

```python
'''

This module contains the function `correct_bracketing` which checks if a string of brackets is correctly balanced.

'''

def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """ brackets is a string of "<" and ">".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("<")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("<>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
    False
    """
    balance = 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '>':
            balance -= 1
        if balance < 0:
            return False
    return balance == 0
```

This code implements the `correct_bracketing` function as described. It uses a simple counter to ensure that every "<" has a corresponding ">", and returns `True` if the brackets are balanced, otherwise `False`.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required to run the `correct_bracketing` function. This function only uses basic Python syntax and operations, which are part of the standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, indicating that no additional packages need to be installed.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required to run the `correct_bracketing` function. This function only uses basic Python syntax and operations, which are part of the standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty, indicating that no additional packages need to be installed.
Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project

As the Programmer correctly pointed out, the `correct_bracketing` function does not require any external libraries or packages beyond Python's standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would indeed be empty, indicating that no additional dependencies are needed. Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

This file serves as documentation to confirm that the project can run with just a standard Python installation.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

# Correct Bracketing

This software provides a simple function to check if a string of brackets is correctly balanced. It is designed to determine whether every opening bracket ("<") has a corresponding closing bracket (">").

## Main Functionality

The main function of this software is `correct_bracketing`, which takes a string of brackets as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the brackets are correctly balanced.

### Function: `correct_bracketing`

- **Input**: A string consisting of the characters "<" and ">".
- **Output**: Returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, otherwise returns `False`.

#### Examples

```python
correct_bracketing("<")       # Returns: False
correct_bracketing("<>")      # Returns: True
correct_bracketing("<<><>>")  # Returns: True
correct_bracketing("><<>")    # Returns: False
```

## Installation

This project does not require any external dependencies, so you can use it directly in your Python environment. However, it is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your Python packages.

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Since there are no external dependencies, you can skip this step. However, if you want to ensure your environment is clean, you can create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

   ```plaintext
   # No external dependencies required for this project
   ```

   Then, install the requirements (if any):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the `correct_bracketing` function, you can import it into your Python script and call it with the desired input string:

```python
from main import correct_bracketing

# Example usage
result = correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
print(result)  # Output: True
```

## Conclusion

This software provides a straightforward solution to check the balance of brackets in a string. It is easy to integrate into any Python project and does not require any additional setup beyond a basic Python environment.
