# Starts One Ends

A Python application to calculate the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with the digit '1'.

## Overview

This application provides a function `starts_one_ends(n)` that, given a positive integer `n`, returns the count of n-digit positive integers that either start or end with the digit '1'. This is useful for mathematical computations and analysis involving digit patterns in numbers.

## Quick Install

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the directory containing `main.py`.

3. There are no additional dependencies required for this application, so you can directly run the script using Python.

## How to Use

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

3. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. The script will execute the `starts_one_ends` function with a sample input of `2` and print the result. You can modify the input value in the script to test with different numbers of digits.

## Functionality

- **Function**: `starts_one_ends(n)`
  - **Input**: A positive integer `n` representing the number of digits.
  - **Output**: The count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with the digit '1'.

### Example

For `n = 2`, the function will calculate the count of 2-digit numbers that start or end with '1'. The expected output is `18`.

## Additional Information

This application is designed to be simple and efficient, focusing solely on the calculation of numbers with specific digit patterns. It does not include any graphical user interface or additional features beyond the core functionality.

For further customization or integration into larger projects, you can modify the `main.py` file as needed.
