Given the task at hand, which involves writing a piece of software code to solve a specific problem, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a functional piece of software, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. An application can effectively encapsulate the code logic needed to solve the problem and can be tested to ensure it meets the customer's requirements. What do you think?

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To solve the task, we need to implement the function `pairs_sum_to_zero` in Python. This function will take a list of integers as input and return `True` if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise.

### Core Function:
- **pairs_sum_to_zero(l):** This function will iterate through the list and check if there exists a pair of distinct elements whose sum is zero.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python
'''

pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
sum to zero, and False otherwise.
>>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
False
>>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
False
>>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
False
>>> pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7])
True
>>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1])
False

'''

def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    seen = set()
    for num in l:
        if -num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False
```

### Explanation:
- We use a set `seen` to keep track of the numbers we have encountered so far.
- For each number `num` in the list, we check if its negation `-num` is already in the set `seen`. If it is, it means we have found a pair `(num, -num)` that sums to zero, and we return `True`.
- If `-num` is not in the set, we add `num` to the set and continue checking the next number.
- If no such pair is found after checking all numbers, we return `False`.

This implementation efficiently checks for pairs that sum to zero using a single pass through the list, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

The provided code does not use any external libraries or packages; it only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, there are no additional dependencies required for this project. The `requirements.txt` file should be empty or not include any specific packages.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

If you prefer to have a completely empty file, you can leave it blank:

```
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any third-party packages.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: The provided code does not use any external libraries or packages; it only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, there are no additional dependencies required for this project. The `requirements.txt` file should be empty or not include any specific packages.
Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
If you prefer to have a completely empty file, you can leave it blank:
```
```
This indicates that the project does not rely on any third-party packages. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."
