To solve the task, we need to implement a function `Strongest_Extension` that calculates the strength of each extension based on the number of uppercase and lowercase letters and returns the strongest extension in the specified format. We will implement this in a single Python file named `main.py`.

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. **Function Definition**: Define the function `Strongest_Extension` which takes two parameters: `class_name` (a string) and `extensions` (a list of strings).

2. **Calculate Strength**: For each extension, calculate its strength as the difference between the number of uppercase letters and lowercase letters.

3. **Determine Strongest Extension**: Identify the extension with the highest strength. If there are ties, select the first one in the list.

4. **Return Result**: Return the result in the format `ClassName.StrongestExtensionName`.

Now, let's implement the code in `main.py`.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `Strongest_Extension` only uses basic Python functionality and does not rely on any external libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

# Strongest Extension User Manual

Welcome to the Strongest Extension software! This tool is designed to help you determine the strongest extension for a given class name based on the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in the extension's name.

## Main Functionality

The primary function of this software is to identify the strongest extension from a list of extensions for a given class name. The strength of an extension is calculated as the difference between the number of uppercase letters (CAP) and the number of lowercase letters (SM) in its name. The extension with the highest strength is considered the strongest. If there are multiple extensions with the same strength, the one that appears first in the list is chosen.

### Example

For example, if you have a class named "Slices" and a list of extensions: `['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed']`, the function will return `'Slices.SErviNGSliCes'` because 'SErviNGSliCes' has the highest strength of -1.

## Installation

This project does not require any external dependencies, so you can run it with a standard Python environment. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your current directory to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

3. **Run the Code**: You can run the `main.py` file directly using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

To use the Strongest Extension function, follow these steps:

1. **Open the `main.py` File**: Open the `main.py` file in your preferred code editor.

2. **Call the Function**: Use the `Strongest_Extension` function by passing the class name and a list of extensions as arguments. For example:
   ```python
   result = Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC'])
   print(result)  # Output: 'my_class.AA'
   ```

3. **View the Result**: The function will return a string in the format `ClassName.StrongestExtensionName`, which you can print or use in your application.

## Documentation

For further details on how the function works, refer to the docstring provided in the `main.py` file. It includes a comprehensive explanation of the function's logic and examples.

## Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions about using the software, please contact our support team at support@chatdev.com.

Thank you for using the Strongest Extension software! We hope it meets your needs and enhances your development process.
