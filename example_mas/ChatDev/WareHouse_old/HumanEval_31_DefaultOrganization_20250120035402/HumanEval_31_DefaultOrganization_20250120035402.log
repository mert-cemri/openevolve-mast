Given the task at hand, which involves writing a function to determine if a number is prime, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application." This is because the task requires implementing a software tool using Python, which aligns with the Application modality. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. Since the task involves writing and testing a Python function, the "Application" modality is the most appropriate choice. It allows us to focus on the code implementation and ensure it functions correctly.

To complete the task, we need to implement the `is_prime` function in Python to determine if a given number is prime. The task specifies that we should not implement a GUI, so we will focus solely on the logic for checking prime numbers. Let's outline the necessary function and then provide the implementation.

### Core Function

- **Function: `is_prime(n)`**
  - **Purpose:** Determine if a given number `n` is a prime number.
  - **Logic:** 
    - A prime number is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
    - If `n` is less than or equal to 1, return `False`.
    - Check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, return `False`.
    - If no divisors are found, return `True`.

Now, let's implement the `is_prime` function in the `main.py` file.

#### main.py

```python
'''

This module contains a function to check if a number is prime.

'''

def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.
    >>> is_prime(6)
    False
    >>> is_prime(101)
    True
    >>> is_prime(11)
    True
    >>> is_prime(13441)
    True
    >>> is_prime(61)
    True
    >>> is_prime(4)
    False
    >>> is_prime(1)
    False
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```

This implementation efficiently checks if a number is prime by first handling small numbers and then using a loop to check divisibility up to the square root of `n`. This approach is optimal for checking primality without unnecessary computations.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the given code, there are no external dependencies or packages required, as it solely involves checking if a number is prime using basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any third-party libraries.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code, there are no external dependencies or packages required, as it solely involves checking if a number is prime using basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```
This indicates that the project does not rely on any third-party libraries. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

As the Chief Executive Officer, I agree with the Programmer's assessment. The code provided for checking if a number is prime does not require any external libraries or dependencies beyond the standard Python library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would indeed be empty. However, for the sake of completeness and to adhere to standard practices, you can include a `requirements.txt` file with a comment indicating that no external dependencies are required. Here is how it would look:

```

This ensures that anyone reviewing the project understands that it is self-contained and does not rely on any additional packages.

# Prime Number Checker

This software provides a simple function to determine if a given number is a prime number. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, with no external dependencies required.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this software is encapsulated in the `is_prime` function. This function takes an integer as input and returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

### Function Definition

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.
    >>> is_prime(6)
    False
    >>> is_prime(101)
    True
    >>> is_prime(11)
    True
    >>> is_prime(13441)
    True
    >>> is_prime(61)
    True
    >>> is_prime(4)
    False
    >>> is_prime(1)
    False
    """
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external libraries or dependencies, making it easy to set up and use. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or download the repository**: Obtain the `main.py` file containing the `is_prime` function.

3. **Run the function**: You can use the function in any Python environment by importing it from the `main.py` file.

## Usage

To use the `is_prime` function, follow these steps:

 # Prime Number Checker

This software provides a simple function to determine if a given number is a prime number. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, with no external dependencies required.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this software is encapsulated in the `is_prime` function. This function takes an integer as input and returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

### Function Definition

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.
    >>> is_prime(6)
    False
    >>> is_prime(101)
    True
    >>> is_prime(11)
    True
    >>> is_prime(13441)
    True
    >>> is_prime(61)
    True
    >>> is_prime(4)
    False
    >>> is_prime(1)
    False
    """
```
