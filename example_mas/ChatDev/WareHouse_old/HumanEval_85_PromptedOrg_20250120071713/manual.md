# Add Function

This software provides a simple utility function to sum even integers located at odd indices in a given list of integers. It is designed to be straightforward and efficient, making it easy to integrate into larger projects or use as a standalone utility.

## Main Functionality

The main function of this software is:

- **add(lst):** This function takes a non-empty list of integers as input and returns the sum of the even integers that are located at odd indices in the list.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import add

result = add([4, 2, 6, 7])
print(result)  # Output: 2
```

In this example, the function `add` evaluates the list `[4, 2, 6, 7]` and sums the even numbers at odd indices. The number `2` is at index `1` (an odd index) and is even, so the function returns `2`.

## Installation

This software does not have any external dependencies, so there is no need for a `requirements.txt` file. You can directly use the provided `main.py` file in your Python environment.

### Quick Start

1. **Download the Code:**
   - Download the `main.py` file to your local machine.

2. **Run the Code:**
   - Use any Python environment to run the code. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

3. **Using the Function:**
   - Import the `add` function from `main.py` and use it as demonstrated in the example above.

## Additional Information

This utility is designed to be minimalistic and efficient, focusing solely on the task of summing even numbers at odd indices. It is suitable for educational purposes, small projects, or as a utility function in larger applications.
