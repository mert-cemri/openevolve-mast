To solve the task, we need to implement the `get_odd_collatz` function in Python. The function should generate the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer `n` and return a sorted list of the odd numbers in that sequence. The task explicitly states not to implement a GUI, so we will focus solely on the logic required to achieve the desired functionality.

### Core Function

- **Function: `get_odd_collatz(n)`**
  - **Purpose**: Generate the Collatz sequence starting from `n` and return a sorted list of odd numbers in the sequence.
  - **Logic**:
    1. Initialize an empty list to store odd numbers.
    2. While `n` is not 1, apply the Collatz rules:
       - If `n` is odd, append it to the list and update `n` to `3 * n + 1`.
       - If `n` is even, update `n` to `n // 2`.
    3. Append 1 to the list (since the sequence always ends at 1).
    4. Return the sorted list of odd numbers.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.  Note:      1. Collatz(1) is [1].     2. returned list sorted in increasing order.  For example: get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5. """  |

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given task and code, there are no external dependencies or packages required to run the `get_odd_collatz` function. The function only uses basic Python operations and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. Here is how it would look:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```
If you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can simply leave it empty or add a comment as shown above. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

[2025-20-01 12:57:54 INFO] Chief Product Officer: **Chief Product Officer<->Chief Executive Officer on : Manual, turn 0**

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            
def get_odd_collatz(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

    Note: 
        1. Collatz(1) is [1].
        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.

    For example:
    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.
    """
.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]
