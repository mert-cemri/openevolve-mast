To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To complete the task, we need to write a Python function that returns the maximum `k` numbers from an array `arr` and sorts them. Since the task explicitly states not to implement a GUI and only to write the necessary code, we will focus solely on the function implementation in a single file named `main.py`.

Here is the plan for the function:

1. **Function Name**: `maximum`
2. **Parameters**:
   - `arr`: A list of integers.
   - `k`: A positive integer representing the number of maximum elements to return.
3. **Purpose**: To return a sorted list of the maximum `k` numbers from the array `arr`.
4. **Steps**:
   - Sort the array in descending order.
   - Slice the first `k` elements from the sorted array.
   - Sort the sliced list in ascending order to match the expected output format.
   - Return the sorted list.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
# main.py

'''
Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list 
of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.

Example 1:

    Input: arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3
    Output: [-4, -3, 5]

Example 2:

    Input: arr = [4, -4, 4], k = 2
    Output: [4, 4]

Example 3:

    Input: arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1
    Output: [2]

Note:
    1. The length of the array will be in the range of [1, 1000].
    2. The elements in the array will be in the range of [-1000, 1000].
    3. 0 <= k <= len(arr)
'''

def maximum(arr, k):
    # Sort the array in descending order
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    # Get the first k elements
    max_k_elements = sorted_arr[:k]
    # Sort the k elements in ascending order
    return sorted(max_k_elements)
```

This code will correctly return a sorted list of the maximum `k` numbers from the input array `arr`. The function first sorts the array in descending order to easily access the largest elements, then slices the first `k` elements, and finally sorts these elements in ascending order before returning them.

This code will correctly return a sorted list of the maximum `k` numbers from the input array `arr`. The function first sorts the array in descending order to easily access the largest elements, then slices the first `k` elements, and finally sorts these elements in ascending order before returning them.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# Maximum K Elements Finder

This software provides a simple function to find the maximum `k` numbers from a given array of integers. The function is designed to return these numbers in sorted order.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `maximum(arr, k)`. This function takes two inputs:
- `arr`: A list of integers.
- `k`: A positive integer representing the number of maximum elements to return.

The function returns a sorted list of the `k` largest numbers from the input array `arr`.

### Example Usage

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** `arr = [-3, -4, 5]`, `k = 3`
   - **Output:** `[-4, -3, 5]`

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** `arr = [4, -4, 4]`, `k = 2`
   - **Output:** `[4, 4]`

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** `arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1]`, `k = 1`
   - **Output:** `[2]`

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to use. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - You can clone the repository to your local machine using:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   - Change your directory to where the `main.py` file is located:
     ```bash
     cd <repository-directory>
     ```

3. **Run the Function:**
   - You can directly run the function in a Python environment or script by importing it:
     ```python
     from main import maximum

     # Example usage
     result = maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3)
     print(result)  # Output: [-4, -3, 5]
     ```

## How to Use

1. **Import the Function:**
   - Ensure you import the `maximum` function from the `main.py` file.

2. **Call the Function:**
   - Pass the array and the integer `k` as arguments to the function.

3. **Receive the Output:**
   - The function will return a sorted list of the maximum `k` numbers from the array.

## Additional Notes

- The length of the array `arr` should be between 1 and 1000.
- The elements in the array should be between -1000 and 1000.
- The value of `k` should be between 0 and the length of the array.

This software is designed to be simple and efficient, providing a quick solution for finding the maximum `k` numbers in an array. Enjoy using it!
