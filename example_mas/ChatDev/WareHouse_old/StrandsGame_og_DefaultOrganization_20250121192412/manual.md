# Strands Game

Welcome to the Strands Game, a word-segmentation puzzle where players combine strands of text to form meaningful words or phrases. The game verifies valid strand formations and confirms completion once all strands are correctly merged.

## Main Functions

- **Strands Combination**: Players are provided with multiple strands of text. The goal is to combine these strands to form valid words.
- **Validation**: The game checks if the formed word is valid and not previously completed.
- **Completion Confirmation**: The game confirms when all valid words have been formed, signaling the completion of the game.
