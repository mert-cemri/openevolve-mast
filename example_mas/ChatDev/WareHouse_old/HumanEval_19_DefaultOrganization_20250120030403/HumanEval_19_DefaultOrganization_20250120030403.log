Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and fixing software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This allows us to focus on implementing the necessary functionality in Python without any additional interfaces or formats. What do you think?

I agree. An "Application" is the most appropriate modality for this task as it involves coding and ensuring the functionality works as desired. This aligns with the requirement to write and fix software code.

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To complete the task, we need to implement a function that sorts a space-delimited string of numerals from 'zero' to 'nine'. The function should return the numerals sorted from smallest to largest. We will focus on implementing the core functionality without any GUI, as the task explicitly states not to implement a GUI interface or anything redundant.

Let's outline the necessary function:

1. **Function: `sort_numbers`**
   - **Purpose**: To sort a space-delimited string of numerals from 'zero' to 'nine' in ascending order.
   - **Input**: A string containing numerals from 'zero' to 'nine'.
   - **Output**: A string with the numerals sorted in ascending order.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":

```

This code defines the `sort_numbers` function, which takes a string of numerals, maps them to their integer values, sorts them, and returns the sorted numerals as a string. The example usage at the end demonstrates how the function works.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required beyond the standard Python library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, as the code relies solely on built-in Python functionality.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required

This indicates that no additional packages need to be installed for the project to run properly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required beyond the standard Python library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, as the code relies solely on built-in Python functionality.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that no additional packages need to be installed for the project to run properly. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Sort Numbers Application

This application provides a simple function to sort a space-delimited string of numerals from 'zero' to 'nine'. The function is designed to take a string input and return a string with the numerals sorted in ascending order based on their numerical value.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this application is encapsulated in the `sort_numbers` function. This function:

- Accepts a space-delimited string of numerals as input.
- Sorts the numerals in ascending order based on their numerical value.
- Returns a space-delimited string of the sorted numerals.

### Example

```python
>>> sort_numbers('three one five')
'one three five'
```

## Installation

### Environment Setup

This application does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to set up. You can run the code in any Python environment. Here are the steps to set up your environment:

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If the code is hosted in a repository, clone it to your local machine. Otherwise, you can directly copy the code into a Python file named `main.py`.
