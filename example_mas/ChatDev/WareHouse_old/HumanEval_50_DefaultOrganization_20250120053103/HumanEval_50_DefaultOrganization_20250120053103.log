To complete the task as specified, we need to implement the `decode_shift` function to complement the existing `encode_shift` function. The task specifies not to implement a GUI, so we will focus solely on the functionality of encoding and decoding strings.

Here is the plan:

1. **Function: `decode_shift(s: str)`**
   - Purpose: This function will decode a string that was encoded using the `encode_shift` function by shifting each character back by 5 positions in the alphabet.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python

'''

This script contains two functions: `encode_shift` and `decode_shift`.
- `encode_shift` encodes a string by shifting each character by 5 positions in the alphabet.
- `decode_shift` decodes a string that was encoded using `encode_shift` by reversing the shift.

'''

def encode_shift(s: str):
    """
    Returns encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])

def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    Takes as input a string encoded with the encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    original = "hello"
    encoded = encode_shift(original)
    decoded = decode_shift(encoded)

    print(f"Original: {original}")
    print(f"Encoded: {encoded}")
    print(f"Decoded: {decoded}")

```

This code provides the necessary functionality to encode and decode strings by shifting characters in the alphabet. The `decode_shift` function reverses the encoding process by shifting characters back by 5 positions. The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how these functions can be used.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

# Shift Encoder/Decoder

This software provides two main functions: `encode_shift` and `decode_shift`. These functions allow you to encode and decode strings by shifting each character by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.

## Main Functions

### encode_shift

- **Description**: Encodes a string by shifting each character by 5 positions in the alphabet.
- **Usage**: `encode_shift(s: str) -> str`
- **Parameters**: 
  - `s`: The input string to be encoded.
- **Returns**: A new string with each character shifted by 5 positions.

### decode_shift

- **Description**: Decodes a string that was encoded using the `encode_shift` function by reversing the shift.
- **Usage**: `decode_shift(s: str) -> str`
- **Parameters**: 
  - `s`: The input string that was encoded using `encode_shift`.
- **Returns**: The original string before encoding.

## Installation

This project does not require any external dependencies. You can run the software using Python without any additional installations.

### Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `main.py`.

4. Run the script using the command:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Usage

The script includes an example usage of the `encode_shift` and `decode_shift` functions. When you run `main.py`, it will encode the string "hello" and then decode it back to the original string.

### Expected Output

```
Original: hello
Encoded: mjqqt
Decoded: hello
```

## Additional Information

- This software is designed to work with lowercase alphabetic characters. Non-alphabetic characters are not supported and may cause unexpected behavior.
- The shift value is hardcoded to 5 in this implementation. If you need a different shift value, you can modify the code accordingly.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs!
