# Physics Uncertainty Calculator User Manual

Welcome to the Physics Uncertainty Calculator! This software is designed to help you calculate the uncertainty in kinetic energy based on the uncertainty in speed. This user manual will guide you through the installation process, main functions, and how to use the application.

## Main Functions

The Physics Uncertainty Calculator provides the following main functions:

- **Calculate Uncertainty in Kinetic Energy**: Given the percentage uncertainty in speed, the application calculates the corresponding uncertainty in kinetic energy. This is based on the formula for kinetic energy \( K = 0.5 \times m \times v^2 \), where the uncertainty in kinetic energy is twice the uncertainty in speed.

## Installation

To use the Physics Uncertainty Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, the application uses the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). Tkinter is included with Python, so no additional installation is required for it.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Install Python**: If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Download the code files to your local machine. You can clone the repository using Git or download the ZIP file and extract it.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code files are located.

4. **Run the Application**: Execute the following command to start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Launch the Application**: Run the `main.py` script as described in the installation section. This will open the Physics Uncertainty Calculator window.

2. **Enter Speed Uncertainty**: The application automatically calculates the uncertainty in kinetic energy for a speed uncertainty of 10% as per the given task. However, you can enter a different value if needed.

3. **Calculate**: Click the "Calculate" button. The application will compute the uncertainty in kinetic energy and display the result.

4. **View Results**: The result will be displayed in the application window, showing the percentage uncertainty in kinetic energy.

## Example Usage

For the given task, the speed uncertainty is 10%. The application calculates the uncertainty in kinetic energy as follows:

- **Input**: Speed Uncertainty = 10%
- **Output**: Uncertainty in Kinetic Energy = 20%

The answer to the task question is: "The answer is (3)"

## Troubleshooting

- **GUI Issues**: If you encounter issues with the GUI not displaying, ensure that you are running the application in an environment that supports Tkinter (e.g., a local machine with a graphical interface).

- **Python Errors**: Ensure that Python is correctly installed and that you are using a compatible version.
