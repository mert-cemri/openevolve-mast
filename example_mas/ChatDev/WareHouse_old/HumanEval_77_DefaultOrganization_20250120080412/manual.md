# iscube Function

This software module provides a simple utility function to determine if a given integer is a perfect cube of another integer.

## Main Functionality

The primary function in this module is `iscube(a)`, which checks if the input integer `a` is a perfect cube of some integer. The function returns `True` if `a` is a perfect cube, and `False` otherwise.

### Examples

- `iscube(1)` returns `True`
- `iscube(2)` returns `False`
- `iscube(-1)` returns `True`
- `iscube(64)` returns `True`
- `iscube(0)` returns `True`
- `iscube(180)` returns `False`

## Installation

### Environment Setup

To use this module, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
