# User Manual for get_max_triples Function

## Introduction

The `get_max_triples` function is a Python utility designed to calculate the number of valid triples in an array generated by a specific mathematical formula. A valid triple is defined as a set of three indices (i, j, k) such that i < j < k, and the sum of the elements at these indices is a multiple of 3.

## Main Functionality

- **Function Name:** `get_max_triples`
- **Input:** A positive integer `n`.
- **Output:** The number of triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) where i < j < k, and a[i] + a[j] + a[k] is a multiple of 3.

### Example

For an input `n = 5`, the function will generate the array `a = [1, 3, 7, 13, 21]`. The function will then calculate and return the number of valid triples. In this case, the output will be `1`, as the only valid triple is (1, 7, 13).

## Installation

This function does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to use in any Python environment. Simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.
