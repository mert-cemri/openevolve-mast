To solve the given task, we need to implement a function `smallest_change` that calculates the minimum number of changes required to make an array palindromic. Since the task specifies not to implement a GUI and only to write the necessary code, we will focus solely on the logic for the `smallest_change` function.

Here's the plan for the function:

1. **Function Name**: `smallest_change`
2. **Purpose**: To determine the minimum number of changes needed to make an array palindromic.
3. **Parameters**: A list of integers `arr`.
4. **Return**: An integer representing the minimum number of changes.

The function will work by comparing elements from the start and end of the array, moving towards the center. If the elements are not equal, a change is needed. The number of such changes will be counted and returned.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python
'''

Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

For example:
smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4
smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1
smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0

'''

def smallest_change(arr):
    changes = 0
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        if arr[left] != arr[right]:
            changes += 1
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    
    return changes

# Example usage:
# print(smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]))  # Output: 4
# print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]))  # Output: 1
# print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]))  # Output: 0
```

This code defines the `smallest_change` function, which iterates over the array from both ends towards the center, counting the number of mismatches. Each mismatch represents a necessary change to make the array palindromic. The function then returns the total count of such changes.

This code defines the `smallest_change` function, which iterates over the array from both ends towards the center, counting the number of mismatches. Each mismatch represents a necessary change to make the array palindromic. The function then returns the total count of such changes.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses basic Python functionality, which does not require any additional libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```

# Palindromic Array Checker

This software provides a function to determine the minimum number of changes required to make an array of integers palindromic. A palindromic array is one that reads the same forwards and backwards. This tool is useful for developers and data scientists who need to analyze or transform datasets to meet specific criteria.

## Main Functionality

The primary function of this software is:

- **`smallest_change(arr)`**: This function takes an array of integers as input and returns the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic. A change involves altering one element to any other element.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage:
print(smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]))  # Output: 4
print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]))  # Output: 1
print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]))  # Output: 0
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it simple to set up and use. You only need Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Clone the repository**: If the code is hosted on a version control system, clone the repository to your local machine.

3. **Navigate to the project directory**: Use the command line to navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.

4. **Run the script**: You can execute the script using Python to test the function with your own arrays.

```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Use

1. **Prepare your data**: Ensure your data is in the form of a list of integers.

2. **Call the function**: Use the `smallest_change` function to determine the number of changes needed for your array.

3. **Interpret the results**: The function will return an integer representing the minimum number of changes required.

## Documentation

For further details on how the function works or to contribute to the project, please refer to the source code comments and docstrings within the `main.py` file. This will provide insights into the logic and structure of the function.

 # Palindromic Array Checker

This software provides a function to determine the minimum number of changes required to make an array of integers palindromic. A palindromic array is one that reads the same forwards and backwards. This tool is useful for developers and data scientists who need to analyze or transform datasets to meet specific criteria.

## Main Functionality

The primary function of this software is:

- **`smallest_change(arr)`**: This function takes an array of integers as input and returns the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic. A change involves altering one element to any other element.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage:
print(smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]))  # Output: 4
print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]))  # Output: 1
print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]))  # Output: 0
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it simple to set up and use. You only need Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Clone the repository**: If the code is hosted on a version control system, clone the repository to your local machine.

3. **Navigate to the project directory**: Use the command line to navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.

4. **Run the script**: You can execute the script using Python to test the function with your own arrays.

```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Use

1. **Prepare your data**: Ensure your data is in the form of a list of integers.

2. **Call the function**: Use the `smallest_change` function to determine the number of changes needed for your array.

3. **Interpret the results**: The function will return an integer representing the minimum number of changes required.
