Given the nature of the task, which involves writing a function to process a string and return specific words based on their lengths, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a software tool that processes input and provides output based on specific criteria. An application would allow us to write and execute the necessary Python code to achieve this functionality. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. The task involves writing a piece of code that processes input and returns output, which aligns well with the "Application" modality. This will allow us to focus on implementing the required functionality without any additional interfaces or formats. Let's proceed with this modality.

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To solve the task, we need to implement a function `words_in_sentence` that filters words from a given sentence based on whether their lengths are prime numbers. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Prime Number Check**: We need a helper function to determine if a number is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Sentence Processing**: Split the sentence into words, check the length of each word, and use the prime-checking function to determine if the length is a prime number.

3. **Output**: Collect words with prime lengths and join them back into a single string, preserving the order.

Let's implement this in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to filter words from a sentence based on the prime length of the words.

        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """

    """
    words = sentence.split()
    prime_length_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    return ' '.join(prime_length_words)

# Example usage:

```

This code defines a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime and uses it within the `words_in_sentence` function to filter words based on their lengths. The solution is efficient and meets the task requirements.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

For the given code, there are no external dependencies or packages required as it only uses basic Python functionality. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, indicating that no additional packages need to be installed for the project to run properly.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
```

This empty file signifies that the project does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Words in Sentence Filter

This software module provides a function to filter words from a sentence based on the prime length of the words. It is designed to help users extract words from a given sentence where the length of each word is a prime number.

## Main Functions

### `words_in_sentence(sentence)`

- **Description**: This function takes a sentence as input and returns a string containing words from the original sentence whose lengths are prime numbers. The order of the words in the new string is the same as in the original sentence.

- **Parameters**: 
  - `sentence` (str): The input sentence containing words separated by spaces.

- **Returns**: 
  - `str`: A string of words with prime lengths, separated by spaces.

- **Example Usage**:
  ```python
  print(words_in_sentence("This is a test"))  # Output: "is"
  print(words_in_sentence("lets go for swimming"))  # Output: "go for"
  ```

## Installation

To use this software, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository containing the `main.py` file.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

3. **Run the Script**: You can run the script using Python by executing the following command:
   ```bash
