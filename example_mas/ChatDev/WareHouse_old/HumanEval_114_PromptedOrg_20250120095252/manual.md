# MinSubArraySum

A Python function to find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array of a given list of integers.

## Introduction

The `minSubArraySum` function is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array within a list of integers. This is useful in various computational scenarios where understanding the smallest possible sum of contiguous elements in an array is necessary.

## Main Function

### minSubArraySum

- **Description**: Given an array of integers `nums`, this function finds the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `nums`: A list of integers.
- **Returns**: An integer representing the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array.
- **Example Usage**:
  ```python
  minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4])  # Returns 1
  minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3])        # Returns -6
  ```

## Installation

### Environment Setup

To run the `minSubArraySum` function, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This function does not require any external Python packages, so there is no need for a `requirements.txt` file. However, ensure your Python environment is set up correctly.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: If the code is hosted in a repository, clone it to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change your working directory to where the `main.py` file is located:
   ```bash
   cd <directory-name>
   ```

3. **Run the Function**: You can test the function by running the `main.py` file in your Python environment:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Modify and Test**: Feel free to modify the input list in the `main.py` file to test with different arrays.

## Conclusion

The `minSubArraySum` function is a simple yet powerful tool for finding the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array in a list of integers. It is efficient and easy to integrate into larger projects where such functionality is required.
