To solve the task, we need to implement the `hex_key` function in Python. This function will count the number of prime hexadecimal digits in a given string. The prime hexadecimal digits are 2, 3, 5, 7, B (11 in decimal), and D (13 in decimal).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Function Definition**: Define the function `hex_key` that takes a single argument `num`, which is a string representing a hexadecimal number.

2. **Prime Digits Set**: Create a set of characters representing the prime hexadecimal digits: {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'}.

3. **Count Primes**: Iterate over each character in the input string `num` and count how many of these characters are in the prime digits set.

4. **Return the Count**: Return the count of prime digits.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file:

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains the implementation of the hex_key function, which counts the number of prime hexadecimal digits in a given string.

'''

def hex_key(num):
    """Counts the number of prime hexadecimal digits in the input string.

    Args:
        num (str): A string representing a hexadecimal number.

    Returns:
        int: The count of prime hexadecimal digits in the input string.
    """
    # Set of prime hexadecimal digits
    prime_hex_digits = {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'}
    
    # Count the number of prime digits in the input string
    prime_count = sum(1 for char in num if char in prime_hex_digits)
    
    return prime_count
```

This code defines the `hex_key` function, which efficiently counts the number of prime hexadecimal digits in the input string by using a set to store the prime digits and a generator expression to iterate over the input string. The function then returns the count of prime digits found.

 To solve the task, we need to implement the `hex_key` function in Python. This function will count the number of prime hexadecimal digits in a given string. The prime hexadecimal digits are 2, 3, 5, 7, B (11 in decimal), and D (13 in decimal).

You are a Code Reviewer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to review and assess source code written by programmers. You ensure code quality by identifying bugs, optimizing performance, and enforcing coding standards. You provide constructive feedback to improve software robustness.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and work closely with programmers.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `hex_key` uses only built-in Python features and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

This indicates that the project does not require any additional packages beyond the standard Python library.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `hex_key` uses only built-in Python features and does not rely on any third-party libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, it would look like this:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```
This indicates that the project does not require any additional packages beyond the standard Python library. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Hex Key User Manual

Welcome to the Hex Key software, a simple yet powerful tool designed to count the number of prime hexadecimal digits in a given string. This manual will guide you through the installation process, introduce the main function of the software, and provide instructions on how to use it effectively.

## Introduction

Hexadecimal numbers are often used in computing and digital electronics. The Hex Key software helps you identify and count the prime digits within a hexadecimal string. Prime numbers in the context of hexadecimal digits are 2, 3, 5, 7, B (11 in decimal), and D (13 in decimal).

## Main Function

The core functionality of the Hex Key software is encapsulated in the `hex_key` function. This function takes a string representing a hexadecimal number as input and returns the count of prime hexadecimal digits within that string.

### Function Signature

```python
def hex_key(num: str) -> int:
```

### Parameters

- `num` (str): A string representing a hexadecimal number. The string may contain characters from the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F}.

### Returns

- `int`: The count of prime hexadecimal digits in the input string.

### Examples

- For `num = "AB"`, the output is `1`.
