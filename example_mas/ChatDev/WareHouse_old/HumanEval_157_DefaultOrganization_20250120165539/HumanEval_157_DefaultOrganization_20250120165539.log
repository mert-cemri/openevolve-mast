To solve the task, we need to implement a function `right_angle_triangle` that checks if three given sides form a right-angled triangle. According to the task, we are not required to implement a GUI interface, so we will focus solely on the logic needed to determine if the sides form a right-angled triangle.

### Core Function
- **right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)**: This function will take three arguments representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle. It will return `True` if these sides form a right-angled triangle, and `False` otherwise. The function will use the Pythagorean theorem to check if the square of the longest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

#### main.py

```python
'''
Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
90 degree.
Example:
right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
'''

def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    # Sort the sides so that the largest side is last
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    # Check if the square of the largest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides
    return sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2
```

This code will correctly determine if the given sides form a right-angled triangle by applying the Pythagorean theorem. The function first sorts the sides to ensure that the largest side is treated as the hypotenuse, then checks if the sum of the squares of the other two sides equals the square of the hypotenuse.

[2025-20-01 16:55:51 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 To solve the task, we need to implement a function `right_angle_triangle` that checks if three given sides form a right-angled triangle. According to the task, we are not required to implement a GUI interface, so we will focus solely on the logic needed to determine if the sides form a right-angled triangle.

It will return `True` if these sides form a right-angled triangle, and `False` otherwise. The function will use the Pythagorean theorem to check if the square of the longest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

#### main.py

```python
'''
Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
90 degree.
Example:
right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
'''

def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    # Sort the sides so that the largest side is last
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    # Check if the square of the largest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides
    return sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2
```

This code will correctly determine if the given sides form a right-angled triangle by applying the Pythagorean theorem. The function first sorts the sides to ensure that the largest side is treated as the hypotenuse, then checks if the sum of the squares of the other two sides equals the square of the hypotenuse.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The function `right_angle_triangle` only uses basic Python operations, which are part of the standard library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty, as no additional packages are needed.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
```
This empty file indicates that there are no external dependencies for this project. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Right Angle Triangle Checker

This software provides a simple function to determine if three given side lengths can form a right-angled triangle. It is implemented in Python and is designed to be straightforward and efficient.

## Main Functionality

The core functionality of this software is encapsulated in the `right_angle_triangle` function. This function takes three arguments, representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and returns a boolean value indicating whether these sides can form a right-angled triangle.

### Function Definition

```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''
    # Sort the sides so that the largest side is last
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    # Check if the square of the largest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides
    return sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation Steps
