    "Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes
    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To solve the task, we need to implement the `pluck` function in Python, which will find the smallest even value in a list and return it along with its index. If there are no even values or the list is empty, it should return an empty list. Here's how we can structure the code:

### Core Function:
- **pluck(arr):** This function will iterate over the input list, identify even numbers, and keep track of the smallest even number and its index. It will return the smallest even number and its index in a list format.

Now, let's implement the code:

FILENAME: main.py

```python

'''

This code defines the `pluck` function, which iterates over the input list `arr`, checks for even numbers, and keeps track of the smallest even number and its index. If no even numbers are found, it returns an empty list.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are a Programmer at ChatDev. Your primary responsibility is to develop software applications by writing code in various programming languages. You have extensive experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and others. You translate project requirements into functional and efficient code.
You report to the technical lead or CTO and collaborate with other programmers and team members.

# Pluck Function User Manual

## Introduction

The `pluck` function is a simple Python utility designed to process an array of non-negative integers and identify the smallest even number within the array. If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found, the function returns the node with the smallest index. This function is particularly useful for applications dealing with tree structures or any scenario where identifying specific nodes based on value and index is required.

## Main Functionality

- **Function Name**: `pluck`
- **Input**: A list of non-negative integers.
- **Output**: A list containing the smallest even value and its index in the format `[smallest_value, index]`. If no even values are present or the list is empty, it returns an empty list `[]`.

### Example Usages

1. **Example 1**:
   - **Input**: `[4, 2, 3]`
   - **Output**: `[2, 1]`
   - **Explanation**: The number 2 is the smallest even value and is located at index 1.

2. **Example 2**:
   - **Input**: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - **Output**: `[2, 1]`
   - **Explanation**: The number 2 is the smallest even value and is located at index 1.

3. **Example 3**:
   - **Input**: `[]`
   - **Output**: `[]`
   - **Explanation**: The input list is empty, so the function returns an empty list.

4. **Example 4**:
   - **Input**: `[5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]`
   - **Output**: `[0, 1]`
   - **Explanation**: The number 0 is the smallest even value. There are two zeros, but the first zero is at index 1.

 # Pluck Function User Manual

## Introduction

The `pluck` function is a simple Python utility designed to process an array of non-negative integers and identify the smallest even number within the array. If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found, the function returns the node with the smallest index. This function is particularly useful for applications dealing with tree structures or any scenario where identifying specific nodes based on value and index is required.

## Main Functionality

- **Function Name**: `pluck`
- **Input**: A list of non-negative integers.
- **Output**: A list containing the smallest even value and its index in the format `[smallest_value, index]`. If no even values are present or the list is empty, it returns an empty list `[]`.

### Example Usages

1. **Example 1**:
   - **Input**: `[4, 2, 3]`
   - **Output**: `[2, 1]`
   - **Explanation**: The number 2 is the smallest even value and is located at index 1.

2. **Example 2**:
   - **Input**: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - **Output**: `[2, 1]`
   - **Explanation**: The number 2 is the smallest even value and is located at index 1.

3. **Example 3**:
   - **Input**: `[]`
   - **Output**: `[]`
   - **Explanation**: The input list is empty, so the function returns an empty list.

4. **Example 4**:
   - **Input**: `[5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]`
   - **Output**: `[0, 1]`
   - **Explanation**: The number 0 is the smallest even value. There are two zeros, but the first zero is at index 1.
