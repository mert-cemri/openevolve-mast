As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

To solve the task, we need to implement the Tribonacci sequence as described in the problem statement. The task requires us to write a function `tri(n)` that returns a list of the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. The sequence is defined with specific rules for even and odd indices.

Given the task's requirements, we will focus on implementing the core logic in a single Python file without any GUI, as the task description does not require a GUI. Let's outline the necessary function and its purpose:

### Core Function:
- **tri(n)**: This function will compute the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence based on the given recurrence relations.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

This code defines the `tri` function, which calculates the Tribonacci sequence according to the rules specified in the task. The function handles the base cases and iteratively computes the sequence for each index up to `n`. The example usage at the end demonstrates how to call the function to get the desired output.

 To solve the task, we need to implement the Tribonacci sequence as described in the problem statement. The task requires us to write a function `tri(n)` that returns a list of the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. The sequence is defined with specific rules for even and odd indices.

Given the task's requirements, we will focus on implementing the core logic in a single Python file without any GUI, as the task description does not require a GUI. Let's outline the necessary function and its purpose:

### Core Function:
- **tri(n)**: This function will compute the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence based on the given recurrence relations.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

"The code logic for generating the Tribonacci sequence is incorrect based on the provided recurrence relations. The recurrence relation for odd `n` is incorrectly implemented.

1. Correct the recurrence relation for odd `n` to use `tri(n - 3)` instead of `tri(n + 1)`.
2. Correct the initial sequence values and logic to match the provided examples.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Based on the provided code, it appears that the implementation of the Tribonacci sequence does not require any external libraries or packages. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no dependencies needed beyond the standard Python library.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, it appears that the implementation of the Tribonacci sequence does not require any external libraries or packages. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file for this project would be empty, as there are no dependencies needed beyond the standard Python library.
Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```
If you plan to add any additional functionality that requires external libraries in the future, you can update this file accordingly. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: 
            Write the software code that is neccessary to solve the following task or fix the following code. In the main.py file, only write the necessary code, nothing more. Do not implement a GUI interface or anything redundant. make sure the code piece works as desired.
            
def tri(n):
    """Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
    the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    For example:
    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
    tri(4) = 3
    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    Examples:
    tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]

# Tribonacci Sequence Generator

This software module provides a function to compute the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence based on specific recurrence relations. It is implemented in Python and is designed to be simple and efficient.

## Quick Install

There are no external dependencies required for this project, so you can directly use the Python standard library to run the code.

## 🤔 What is this?

The Tribonacci sequence is a variation of the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the three preceding ones, with specific initial values. This software computes the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence using the following rules:

- tri(0) = 1
- tri(1) = 3
- tri(2) = 2
- For n >= 3:
  - If n is even, tri(n) = 1 + n / 2
  - If n is odd, tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n - 3)

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this module is `tri(n)`, which computes the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.

### Function Signature

```python
def tri(n):
    """
    Computes the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    Parameters:
    n (int): A non-negative integer representing the number of terms to compute.
    Returns:
    list: A list containing the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    """
