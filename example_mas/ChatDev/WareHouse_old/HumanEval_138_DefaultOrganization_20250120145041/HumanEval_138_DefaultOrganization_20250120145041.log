Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and testing a piece of software code, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task requires implementing a function in Python, which aligns with the capabilities of an application that can execute and test code. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree with your assessment. An "Application" is indeed the most appropriate modality for this task, as it involves writing and executing Python code to solve a specific problem. This allows us to focus on the functionality and correctness of the code.

To solve the given task, we need to implement a function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` that checks if a given number `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. The task does not require a GUI, so we will focus solely on the logic needed to solve the problem.

### Core Function

- **Function: `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)`**
  - **Purpose**: Determine if the number `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers.
  - **Logic**: 
    - A positive even number can be represented as `2k` where `k` is a positive integer.
    - The smallest sum of four positive even numbers is `2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8`.
    - Therefore, for any number less than 8, the function should return `False`.
    - For numbers 8 and above, the function should return `True` if `n` is even, since any even number greater than or equal to 8 can be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers.

Let's implement this logic in the `main.py` file.

### Implementation

MAIN.PY

```python
'''

Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.

Example:
is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False
is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False
is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True

'''

def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    # The smallest sum of four positive even numbers is 8 (2+2+2+2)
    # Therefore, n must be at least 8 and even to be expressed as such a sum
    return n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0

# Example usage
# print(is_equal_to_sum_even(4))  # Output: False
# print(is_equal_to_sum_even(6))  # Output: False
# print(is_equal_to_sum_even(8))  # Output: True
```

This code defines the function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` which checks if a number `n` can be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers. It returns `True` if `n` is greater than or equal to 8 and is even, otherwise it returns `False`. The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how the function works with different inputs.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Chief Executive Officer, I can confirm that the Programmer's assessment is correct. The function `is_equal_to_sum_even` in the `main.py` file does not require any external libraries or packages beyond the standard Python library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, indicating that there are no additional dependencies needed for this project.

This empty file signifies that the project relies solely on Python's built-in capabilities and does not require any third-party packages. If there are any future changes or additions to the code that introduce dependencies, the `requirements.txt` file should be updated accordingly to reflect those needs.

 <INFO> As the Chief Executive Officer, I can confirm that the Programmer's assessment is correct. The function `is_equal_to_sum_even` in the `main.py` file does not require any external libraries or packages beyond the standard Python library. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty, indicating that there are no additional dependencies needed for this project.

Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

# is_equal_to_sum_even

## Introduction

The `is_equal_to_sum_even` function is a simple Python utility designed to evaluate whether a given number can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. This function is useful in mathematical computations and problem-solving scenarios where such a condition needs to be verified.

## Main Functionality

- **Function Name:** `is_equal_to_sum_even`
- **Purpose:** To determine if a given integer `n` can be represented as the sum of four positive even numbers.
- **Example Usage:**
  - `is_equal_to_sum_even(4)` returns `False`
  - `is_equal_to_sum_even(6)` returns `False`
  - `is_equal_to_sum_even(8)` returns `True`

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. However, it is recommended to have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed:**
   - You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the repository or download the script:**
   - You can clone the repository using Git:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
   - Or download the `main.py` file directly.

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to the directory containing `main.py`:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

2. **Run the Python script:**
   - You can test the function by running the script in a Python environment.
   - Open a Python shell or create a new Python script and import the function:
     ```python
     from main import is_equal_to_sum_even
     ```

3. **Call the function with an integer argument:**
   - Example:
     ```python
     result = is_equal_to_sum_even(8)
     print(result)  # Output: True
     ```

## Documentation

The function is straightforward and does not require additional libraries or frameworks. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient for quick evaluations.

For any further questions or support, please contact the development team at ChatDev.
