To solve the task, we need to implement the `count_nums` function in Python. This function will take an array of integers and return the number of elements for which the sum of their digits is greater than zero. We will handle both positive and negative numbers, ensuring that the first digit of a negative number is considered negative.

Here's the plan:

1. **Function: `count_nums`**
   - **Purpose**: To count how many numbers in the given array have a sum of digits greater than zero.
   - **Logic**:
     - For each number in the array, calculate the sum of its digits.
     - If the number is negative, the first digit should be negative.
     - Count the number of elements where the sum of digits is greater than zero.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python

'''

Write a function count_nums which takes an array of integers and returns
the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.
If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:
e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.
>>> count_nums([]) == 0
>>> count_nums([-1, 11, -11]) == 1
>>> count_nums([1, 1, 2]) == 3

'''

def count_nums(arr):
    def sum_of_digits(n):
        # Convert number to string to iterate over digits
        s = str(n)
        # Initialize sum
        total = 0
        # If the number is negative, handle the first digit separately
        if s[0] == '-':
            total += int(s[0:2])  # Add the negative first digit
            s = s[2:]  # Remove the negative sign and first digit
        # Add the rest of the digits
        total += sum(int(digit) for digit in s)
        return total

    # Count numbers with sum of digits > 0
    count = 0
    for num in arr:
        if sum_of_digits(num) > 0:
            count += 1
    return count

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(count_nums([]))          # Output: 0
    print(count_nums([-1, 11, -11]))  # Output: 1
    print(count_nums([1, 1, 2]))   # Output: 3

```

This code defines the `count_nums` function, which calculates the sum of digits for each number in the array and counts how many have a sum greater than zero. The function `sum_of_digits` handles both positive and negative numbers correctly.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code only uses Python's built-in functions and standard library, so a `requirements.txt` file is not necessary. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for the sake of completeness, it would simply be empty or you could include a comment indicating that no external packages are needed.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
