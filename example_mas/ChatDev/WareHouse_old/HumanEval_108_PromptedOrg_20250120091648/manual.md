# Count Nums

A simple Python application to count the number of integers in an array where the sum of the digits is greater than zero. This application handles both positive and negative integers.

### Example Usage

- `count_nums([])` returns `0`
- `count_nums([-1, 11, -11])` returns `1`
- `count_nums([1, 1, 2])` returns `3`
