Given the task at hand, which involves writing a piece of software code to solve a specific problem, it seems that the most appropriate product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task is focused on implementing a functional piece of code, which aligns with the nature of applications as tools or software. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree. The task requires implementing a functional piece of code, which fits well with the "Application" modality. This will allow us to focus on the code functionality without any additional interfaces or presentations.

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To solve the task, we need to implement the function `greatest_common_divisor` which calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. This algorithm is efficient and widely used for computing the GCD.

Here's the breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Function Name**: `greatest_common_divisor`
2. **Purpose**: Calculate and return the greatest common divisor of two integers.
3. **Algorithm**: Use the Euclidean algorithm, which involves repeated division and taking remainders.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.

'''

def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """ Return the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
    1
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
    5
    """
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

This implementation uses a `while` loop to repeatedly apply the Euclidean algorithm until the remainder is zero, at which point `a` will be the GCD of the original two numbers.

For the given code, which calculates the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm, there are no external dependencies or packages required. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you want to include a placeholder for potential future dependencies, you can create an empty `requirements.txt` file or simply include a comment indicating that no dependencies are required.

Here is how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file would be empty. However, if you want to include a placeholder for potential future dependencies, you can create an empty `requirements.txt` file or simply include a comment indicating that no dependencies are required.

The Programmer has correctly identified that the given code for calculating the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm does not require any external dependencies or packages. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should indeed be empty or contain a comment indicating that no dependencies are required.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

# Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculator

This software module provides a simple and efficient way to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers without leaving a remainder.

## Main Function

The main function provided by this module is:

- `greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int`: This function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their greatest common divisor.

### Example Usage

```python
>>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
1
>>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
5
```

## Installation

This project does not require any external dependencies, so you can use it directly without installing additional packages. However, you need to have Python installed on your system.

### Quick Install

1. **Ensure Python is installed**: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or download the `main.py` file to your local machine.

## How to Use

1. **Open a terminal or command prompt**.

2. **Navigate to the directory** where `main.py` is located.

3. **Run Python interactive shell** or create a Python script to use the function:

   - **Interactive Shell**:
     ```bash
     python
     ```

     Then, within the Python shell, you can import and use the function:
     ```python
     from main import greatest_common_divisor
     print(greatest_common_divisor(3, 5))
     print(greatest_common_divisor(25, 15))
     ```

   - **Python Script**:
     Create a new Python file, say `test_gcd.py`, and add the following code:
     ```python
     from main import greatest_common_divisor

     print(greatest_common_divisor(3, 5))
     print(greatest_common_divisor(25, 15))
     ```

     Run the script using:
     ```bash
     python test_gcd.py
     ```

## Documentation

This module is designed to be simple and straightforward, with a single function that performs the GCD calculation. For more information on the Euclidean algorithm, you can refer to [Euclidean algorithm on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm).

Feel free to modify and extend the code as needed for your specific use cases.
