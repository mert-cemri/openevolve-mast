To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To complete the task, we need to implement the `decode_shift` function to complement the existing `encode_shift` function. The `decode_shift` function should reverse the encoding process by shifting each character back by 5 positions in the alphabet. Since the task specifies not to implement a GUI and only to write the necessary code, we will focus solely on the logic required for encoding and decoding.

Let's outline the necessary functions:

1. **encode_shift(s: str)**: This function is already provided and shifts each character in the input string by 5 positions forward in the alphabet.

2. **decode_shift(s: str)**: This function will decode the string by shifting each character back by 5 positions in the alphabet.

Now, let's implement the `decode_shift` function in the `main.py` file.

MAIN.PY

```python
'''

This module provides functions to encode and decode strings by shifting characters in the alphabet.

'''

def encode_shift(s: str):
    """
    Returns encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])

def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    Takes as input a string encoded with the encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    original_text = "hello"
    encoded_text = encode_shift(original_text)
    decoded_text = decode_shift(encoded_text)

    print(f"Original: {original_text}")
    print(f"Encoded: {encoded_text}")
    print(f"Decoded: {decoded_text}")
```

This code defines both the `encode_shift` and `decode_shift` functions. The `decode_shift` function shifts each character back by 5 positions, effectively reversing the encoding process. The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how to use these functions to encode and decode a string.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The code provided is almost correct, but it does not handle uppercase letters or non-alphabetic characters. The current implementation assumes all input characters are lowercase alphabetic characters. To make it more robust, we should add logic to handle uppercase letters and leave non-alphabetic characters unchanged. Here is the revised code:

```python
def encode_shift(s: str):
    """
    Returns encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.
    Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, and leaves non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
    """

    for ch in s:
        if 'a' <= ch <= 'z':
            encoded_chars.append(chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord('a')) % 26) + ord('a')))
        elif 'A' <= ch <= 'Z':
            encoded_chars.append(chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord('A')) % 26) + ord('A')))
        else:
            encoded_chars.append(ch)
    return "".join(encoded_chars)

def decode_shift(s: str):

    Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, and leaves non-alphabetic characters unchanged.

    decoded_chars = []
    for ch in s:
        if 'a' <= ch <= 'z':
            decoded_chars.append(chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord('a')) % 26) + ord('a')))
        elif 'A' <= ch <= 'Z':
            decoded_chars.append(chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord('A')) % 26) + ord('A')))

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is almost correct, but it does not handle uppercase letters or non-alphabetic characters. The current implementation assumes all input characters are lowercase alphabetic characters. To make it more robust, we should add logic to handle uppercase letters and leave non-alphabetic characters unchanged. Here is the revised code:

```python
def encode_shift(s: str):
    """
    Returns encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.
    Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, and leaves non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
    """

            encoded_chars.append(chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord('a')) % 26) + ord('a')))
        elif 'A' <= ch <= 'Z':
            encoded_chars.append(chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord('A')) % 26) + ord('A')))
        else:
            encoded_chars.append(ch)
    return "".join(encoded_chars)

def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    Takes as input a string encoded with the encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, and leaves non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
    """
    decoded_chars = []

        if 'a' <= ch <= 'z':
            decoded_chars.append(chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord('a')) % 26) + ord('a')))
        elif 'A' <= ch <= 'Z':
            decoded_chars.append(chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord('A')) % 26) + ord('A')))

In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. The code only uses standard Python libraries and functions. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty or not needed. However, if you still want to provide a `requirements.txt` file, it would look like this:

As the code provided only uses standard Python libraries and functions, there are no external dependencies required for the project to run. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty. However, if you still want to include a `requirements.txt` file for documentation purposes, it would look like this:

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Shift Encoder/Decoder

This software provides functions to encode and decode strings by shifting characters in the alphabet. It handles both uppercase and lowercase letters and leaves non-alphabetic characters unchanged.

## Main Functions

### encode_shift(s: str)

- **Description**: Encodes a given string by shifting every character by 5 positions in the alphabet.
- **Input**: A string `s` that you want to encode.
- **Output**: An encoded string with each character shifted by 5 positions.
- **Example**: 
  ```python
  encoded_text = encode_shift("Hello, World!")
  print(encoded_text)  # Outputs: "Mjqqt, Btwqi!"
  ```

### decode_shift(s: str)

- **Description**: Decodes a string that was encoded using the `encode_shift` function.
- **Input**: A string `s` that was encoded with the `encode_shift` function.
- **Output**: The original string before encoding.
- **Example**: 
  ```python
  decoded_text = decode_shift("Mjqqt, Btwqi!")
  print(decoded_text)  # Outputs: "Hello, World!"
  ```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies. You can run it with a standard Python installation.

### Quick Install

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone or download the repository containing the `main.py` file.

## How to Use

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.
3. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. The script will execute the example usage, encoding and then decoding the string "Hello, World!", and print the results to the console.

## Documentation

For further details on how the functions work, please refer to the comments within the `main.py` file. The code is documented to explain how each function processes the input and produces the output.
