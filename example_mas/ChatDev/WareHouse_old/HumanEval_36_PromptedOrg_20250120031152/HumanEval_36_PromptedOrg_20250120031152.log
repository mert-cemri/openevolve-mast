To solve the task, we need to implement the `fizz_buzz` function in Python. The function should count the number of times the digit '7' appears in integers less than `n` that are divisible by either 11 or 13. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Function Definition**: Define the function `fizz_buzz` that takes an integer `n` as an argument.
2. **Iterate through Numbers**: Loop through numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
3. **Check Divisibility**: For each number, check if it is divisible by 11 or 13.
4. **Count Digit '7'**: If the number is divisible by 11 or 13, convert it to a string and count the occurrences of the digit '7'.
5. **Return the Count**: Sum up all the counts of '7' and return the total.

Now, let's implement this in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME: main.py

```python

'''

Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

'''

def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            count += str(i).count('7')
    return count

```

This code defines the `fizz_buzz` function, iterates through numbers less than `n`, checks for divisibility by 11 or 13, counts the occurrences of the digit '7', and returns the total count.

        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:

    return count

```

This code defines the `fizz_buzz` function, iterates through numbers less than `n`, checks for divisibility by 11 or 13, counts the occurrences of the digit '7', and returns the total count.

For the provided code, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code only uses standard Python functionality, which means you don't need to specify any additional packages in a `requirements.txt` file. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for the sake of completeness, you can leave it empty or include a comment indicating that no additional packages are needed.

Here's how you can create the `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

This comment serves as documentation for anyone reviewing the project, indicating that the code relies solely on Python's standard library.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Fizz Buzz Digit Counter

This software provides a function to count the number of times the digit '7' appears in integers less than a given number `n`, where those integers are divisible by either 11 or 13.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int`. This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the count of the digit '7' in numbers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage of the fizz_buzz function
result = fizz_buzz(78)
print(result)  # Output will be 2
```

## Installation

This software does not require any external dependencies, making it straightforward to use. You only need Python installed on your system.

### Step-by-step Installation Guide

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If the code is hosted in a repository, clone it to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change into the project directory where `main.py` is located.

4. **Run the Code**: You can run the code directly using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Import the Function**: If you are integrating this function into another project, you can import it as follows:
   ```python
   from main import fizz_buzz
   ```

2. **Call the Function**: Use the function by passing an integer `n` to get the count of '7's in numbers divisible by 11 or 13.
   ```python
   count_of_sevens = fizz_buzz(100)
   print(count_of_sevens)
   ```

## Documentation

For further details on how the function works, refer to the docstring within the `main.py` file. The docstring provides examples and a brief explanation of the function's purpose.

This software is designed to be simple and efficient, with no additional setup required beyond having Python installed. Enjoy using the Fizz Buzz Digit Counter!
