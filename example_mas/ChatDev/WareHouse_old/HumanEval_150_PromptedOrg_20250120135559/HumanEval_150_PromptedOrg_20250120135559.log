Given the task at hand, which involves writing a simple Python function to determine if a number is prime and return a corresponding value, the most suitable product modality would be an "Application". This is because the task involves implementing a software tool that performs a specific function, which aligns with the capabilities of an application. What are your thoughts on this?

To solve the task, we need to implement the function `x_or_y` which determines if a given number `n` is a prime number. If `n` is prime, the function should return `x`; otherwise, it should return `y`. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:

1. **Check if a number is prime**: We need a helper function to determine if a number is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Implement the `x_or_y` function**: This function will use the helper function to check if `n` is prime and return the appropriate value (`x` or `y`).

Let's implement this in the `main.py` file.

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains a function `x_or_y` which returns the value of `x` if `n` is a prime number and returns the value of `y` otherwise.

'''

def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    """Return x if n is a prime number, otherwise return y."""
    return x if is_prime(n) else y
```

In this implementation:

- The `is_prime` function checks if a number `n` is prime by first handling small numbers and then using a loop to check divisibility up to the square root of `n`.
- The `x_or_y` function uses the `is_prime` function to determine if `n` is prime and returns `x` if it is, otherwise it returns `y`. 

This code should meet the requirements specified in the task description.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Based on the provided code, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The code only utilizes Python's built-in functionality, so there are no dependencies to specify in a `requirements.txt` file. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should be empty or not necessary for this project. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for future use or documentation purposes, it can simply be an empty file:

```

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The code only utilizes Python's built-in functionality, so there are no dependencies to specify in a `requirements.txt` file. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` file should be empty or not necessary for this project. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for future use or documentation purposes, it can simply be an empty file:
```
# requirements.txt
# No external dependencies are required for this project.
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

## Overview

The `x_or_y` function is a simple utility that checks if a number `n` is a prime number. If `n` is prime, the function returns the value of `x`; otherwise, it returns the value of `y`.

### Main Functions

- **is_prime(n)**: A helper function that checks if a number `n` is prime.
- **x_or_y(n, x, y)**: The main function that returns `x` if `n` is prime, and `y` otherwise.

## Installation

This project does not require any external dependencies. You can run the code directly in any Python environment. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Steps to Install Python

1. **Download Python**: Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for your operating system.
2. **Install Python**: Follow the installation instructions provided on the website to install Python on your system.

1. **Open a Python Environment**: You can use any Python IDE or a simple text editor with a terminal.
2. **Copy the Code**: Copy the following code into your Python environment:

    ```python
    def is_prime(n):
        """Check if a number is prime."""
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        if n <= 3:
            return True
        if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
            return False
        i = 5
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
                return False
            i += 6
        return True

    def x_or_y(n, x, y):
        """Return x if n is a prime number, otherwise return y."""
        return x if is_prime(n) else y
    ```

3. **Call the Function**: Use the `x_or_y` function by passing the required parameters. For example:

    ```python
