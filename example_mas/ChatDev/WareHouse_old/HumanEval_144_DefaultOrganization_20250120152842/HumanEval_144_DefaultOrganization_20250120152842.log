Given the nature of the task, which involves writing and testing a piece of software code, I believe the most appropriate product modality would be an "Application". This would allow us to implement the necessary logic and provide a functional solution to the customer's problem. What are your thoughts on this?

To address the customer's task, we need to implement a function `simplify` that checks if the product of two fractions is a whole number. The task specifies that we should not implement a GUI, so we will focus solely on the function implementation.

### Core Function

- **simplify(x, n):** This function takes two string representations of fractions and returns `True` if their product is a whole number, otherwise `False`.

### Implementation Details

1. **Parse Fractions:** Convert the string representations of fractions into numerical values.
2. **Multiply Fractions:** Calculate the product of the two fractions.
3. **Check Whole Number:** Determine if the resulting product is a whole number.

Now, let's implement the function in the `main.py` file.

```python
'''

This module contains the implementation of the simplify function which checks if the product of two fractions is a whole number.

def simplify(x, n):

    You can assume that x, and n are valid fractions, and do not have zero as denominator.

    simplify("1/5", "5/1") = True
    simplify("1/6", "2/1") = False
    simplify("7/10", "10/2") = False
    """
    # Split the fractions into numerator and denominator
    x_num, x_den = map(int, x.split('/'))
    n_num, n_den = map(int, n.split('/'))
    
    # Calculate the product of the fractions
    product_num = x_num * n_num
    product_den = x_den * n_den
    
    # Check if the product is a whole number
    return product_num % product_den == 0

# Example usage
print(simplify("1/5", "5/1"))  # True
print(simplify("1/6", "2/1"))  # False
print(simplify("7/10", "10/2"))  # False
```

This implementation parses the fractions, calculates their product, and checks if the result is a whole number by verifying if the numerator is divisible by the denominator without a remainder.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

For the given code, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The function `simplify` only utilizes basic Python operations and functions. Therefore, a `requirements.txt` file is not necessary for this project. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can simply leave it empty or include a comment indicating that no external dependencies are required.

Here's how you can create an empty `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required
```

This indicates that the project does not rely on any additional Python packages beyond the standard library.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the given code, there are no external libraries or packages being used. The function `simplify` only utilizes basic Python operations and functions. Therefore, a `requirements.txt` file is not necessary for this project. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for completeness, you can simply leave it empty or include a comment indicating that no external dependencies are required.
Here's how you can create an empty `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required
```
This indicates that the project does not rely on any additional Python packages beyond the standard library. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."
