To solve the task, we need to implement the `fizz_buzz` function in Python. The function should count how many times the digit '7' appears in numbers less than `n` that are divisible by either 11 or 13. Here's how we can break down the task:

1. **Function Name**: `fizz_buzz`
   - **Purpose**: To count the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13.

2. **Steps to Implement**:
   - Iterate over each number less than `n`.
   - Check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13.
   - Convert the number to a string and count the occurrences of '7'.
   - Accumulate the count of '7's and return the total count.

Now, let's implement the code in the `main.py` file:

FILENAME

```python
'''

This module contains the implementation of the fizz_buzz function which counts the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers less than a given integer n that are divisible by 11 or 13.

'''

def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The upper limit (exclusive) to check numbers against.

    Returns:
    int: The count of digit '7' in numbers divisible by 11 or 13.
    
    Examples:
    >>> fizz_buzz(50)
    0
    >>> fizz_buzz(78)
    2
    >>> fizz_buzz(79)
    3
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            count += str(i).count('7')
    return count
```

This code defines the `fizz_buzz` function as specified, iterating through numbers less than `n`, checking divisibility by 11 or 13, and counting occurrences of the digit '7'. The function then returns the total count.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code only uses standard Python functionality, which means you don't need to specify any additional packages in a `requirements.txt` file. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for completeness or future use, it would simply be an empty file or contain a comment indicating no dependencies are needed.

Here's how you can create an empty `requirements.txt` file:

```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```

Or simply leave it empty:

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: For the provided code in `main.py`, there are no external dependencies or packages required. The code only uses standard Python functionality, which means you don't need to specify any additional packages in a `requirements.txt` file. However, if you still want to create a `requirements.txt` file for completeness or future use, it would simply be an empty file or contain a comment indicating no dependencies are needed.
Here's how you can create an empty `requirements.txt` file:
```
# No external dependencies required for this project
```
Or simply leave it empty:

``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Fizz Buzz Digit Counter

This software provides a function to count the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers less than a given integer `n` that are divisible by either 11 or 13. This can be useful for various mathematical and programming exercises or challenges.

## Main Functionality

The main function provided by this software is `fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int`. It calculates how many times the digit '7' appears in numbers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13.

### Function Signature

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
```

### Parameters

- `n` (int): The upper limit (exclusive) to check numbers against.

### Returns

- `int`: The count of digit '7' in numbers divisible by 11 or 13.

### Examples

```python
>>> fizz_buzz(50)
0
>>> fizz_buzz(78)
2
>>> fizz_buzz(79)
3
```

## Installation

To use this software, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Move into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Although there are no external dependencies for this project, it is a good practice to create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install Required Packages**: If there were any dependencies, you would install them using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Currently, the `requirements.txt` file is empty as there are no external dependencies.

## Usage

To use the `fizz_buzz` function, you can import it into your Python script or interactive session and call it with the desired integer `n`.

### Example Usage

```python
from main import fizz_buzz

result = fizz_buzz(100)
print(f"The digit '7' appears {result} times in numbers less than 100 that are divisible by 11 or 13.")
```

This will output the number of times the digit '7' appears in numbers less than 100 that are divisible by 11 or 13.

## Conclusion

This software provides a simple yet effective way to count specific digit occurrences in numbers divisible by certain integers. It is designed to be easy to use and integrate into larger projects or used standalone for specific tasks.
