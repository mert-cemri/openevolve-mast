# Triangle Area Calculator

This software provides a simple function to calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height. It is implemented in Python and does not require any external dependencies.

## Main Function

The main function provided by this software is:

- `triangle_area(a, h)`: This function calculates the area of a triangle using the formula: 

  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
  \]

  **Parameters:**
  - `a` (float): The length of the base of the triangle.
  - `h` (float): The height of the triangle.

  **Returns:**
  - The area of the triangle as a float.

  **Example:**
  ```python
  >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
  7.5
  ```

## Installation

This software does not require any external libraries or dependencies. You only need Python installed on your system to run the code.

### Quick Install
