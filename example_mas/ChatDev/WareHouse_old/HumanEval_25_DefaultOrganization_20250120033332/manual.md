# Factorize Function User Manual

Welcome to the user manual for the Factorize function, a simple Python application designed to return the list of prime factors of a given integer. This document will guide you through the installation process, introduce the main functionality of the software, and provide instructions on how to use it effectively.

## Introduction

The Factorize function is a utility that takes an integer as input and returns a list of its prime factors in ascending order. Each prime factor is listed as many times as it appears in the factorization of the number. This function is useful for mathematical computations and educational purposes.

## Main Functionality

- **factorize(n: int) -> List[int]**: This function takes an integer `n` and returns a list of its prime factors. The factors are listed from smallest to largest, and each factor appears as many times as it divides the number.

### Example Usage

```python
>>> factorize(8)
[2, 2, 2]
>>> factorize(25)
[5, 5]
>>> factorize(70)
[2, 5, 7]
```

## Installation

The Factorize function is implemented in Python and does not require any external dependencies. To use the function, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
