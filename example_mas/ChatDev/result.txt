Sure! Here's a Python function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = []
    if n <= 0:
        return fib_sequence
    elif n == 1:
        fib_sequence.append(0)
        return fib_sequence
    else:
        fib_sequence = [0, 1]
        while len(fib_sequence) < n:
            next_num = fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2]
            fib_sequence.append(next_num)
        return fib_sequence
```

You can use this function by calling `fibonacci(n)`, where `n` is the number of terms you want in the Fibonacci sequence. The function will return a list of numbers representing the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` terms.

For example, if you call `fibonacci(10)`, it will return `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]`, which is the Fibonacci sequence up to 10 terms.
