Sure! Here's a Python function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms and returns a list of numbers:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = []
    if n <= 0:
        return fib_sequence
    elif n == 1:
        fib_sequence.append(0)
        return fib_sequence
    else:
        fib_sequence = [0, 1]
        while len(fib_sequence) < n:
            next_number = fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2]
            fib_sequence.append(next_number)
        return fib_sequence
```

You can use this function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specific number of terms. For example, calling `fibonacci(10)` will return `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]`.
