This file contains the implementation of the function f, which generates a list based on the given rules:
- If the index i is even, the element is the factorial of i.
- If the index i is odd, the element is the sum of numbers from 1 to i.

    Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,
    and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
    i starts from 1.
    the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).
    Example:
    f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
