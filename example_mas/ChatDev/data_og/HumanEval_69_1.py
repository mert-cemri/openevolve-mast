'''
The function `search(lst)` takes a list of positive integers and returns the greatest integer
that has a frequency greater than or equal to its value. If no such integer exists, it returns -1.

def search(lst):
    from collections import Counter
    # Count the frequency of each integer in the list
    frequency = Counter(lst)
    # Initialize the result as -1
    result = -1
    # Iterate over the frequency dictionary
    for num, freq in frequency.items():
        # Check if the frequency is greater than or equal to the integer itself
        if freq >= num:
            # Update the result with the maximum valid integer
            result = max(result, num)
    return result
# Example usage:
# print(search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]))  # Output: 2
# print(search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]))  # Output: 3
# print(search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]))  # Output: -1
