*** begin of things you should answer ***

1. Freeform text summary of the problems with the inefficiencies or failure modes in the trace: The program and test cases were created successfully, but potential ambiguities in the function's behavior with missing or nonexistent keys were not clarified or explicitly documented, which could lead to misunderstandings in different contexts.

2. Whether the task is successfully completed or not: yes
