Freeform text summary of the problems with the inefficiencies or failure modes in the trace: The system incorrectly activates a multi-agent setup for a task different from the given prompt (chess game vs tictactoe), leading to misalignment and failure in executing the intended task, with only partial implementation and testing covered and lack of verification for special chess rules and conditions.
