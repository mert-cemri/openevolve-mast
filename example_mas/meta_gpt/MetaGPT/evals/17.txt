*** begin of things you should answer ***

1. Freeform text summary of the problems with the inefficiencies or failure modes in the trace: The multi-agent system successfully implemented a dice rolling game script and its corresponding tests, but the design of the tests overly relies on output validation through `print` statements, causing fragility to changes in output formatting without directly confirming core game logic.

2. Whether the task is successfully completed or not: yes

3.4 Tendency to over-achieve: no
3.5 Underperform by waiting on instructions: no
3.6 Withhold information: no
3.7 Derailing from task objectives: no
3.8 Waiting on agents to discover known information: no
3.9 Redundant conversation for iterative tasks: no
3.10 Unaware of stopping conditions: no
3.11 Difficult in agreeing with agents: no
3.12 No attempt to verify outcome: no
3.13 Evaluator fails to be critical: yes
3.14 Poor adherence to task objectives: no
3.15 Misalignment between internal thoughts and response message: no
3.16 Claiming that a task is done while it is not true: no
3.17 Ignoring good suggestions from other agents: no
3.18 Discontinued reasoning: no
3.19 Trajectory restart: no
3.20 Step repetition: yes
